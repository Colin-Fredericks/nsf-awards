 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to redesign the laboratory component of the undergraduate Vertebrate Physiology course, for Biology majors, in order to: I ) stimulate student critical thinking and problem solving, 2) help students improve their conceptual understanding of physiological processes, 3) focus understanding at the cellular level of physiology, and 4~ provide opportunities for student experimentation, data collection and analysis. The course as it is presently taught is traditional in terms of its laboratory approach in that \"canned\" laboratories are conducted and little new technology is used. These laboratories could be far more challenging and stimulating if students: I) conducted fewer such experiments and designed their own investigations, 2) had available physiograph equipment interfaced with computers to collect and analyze data, and 3) had access to animated. interactive, multimedia renderings of physiological processes. At present, the existing phisiograph equipment is computer incompatible only two computers are available for a laboratory o~ 16 students, and only a single copy of A.D.A.M. interactive software is available for demonstration. The objectives of this project are to: 1) introduce computer-based labs using  Intellitool equipment, 2) develop and extend student labs into student- designed investigations which require 2-3 ~ weeks of student research in the areas of cardiovascular, respiratory and muscle physiology, and 3) incorporate and \"layer\" animated, interactive, visual, CD-ROM software into  traditional labs. Funding is requested for the purchase of, physiograph equipment, A.D.A.M. interactive software, six computers and two printers. It is expected that the redesigned Vertebrate Physiology course will promote intellectual curiosity, deepen understanding of physiological processes, and encourage young women to apply technology with confidence in the study of science.",
