The  Hall effect will be studied  in  NCCO  and  PCCO  superconductors of varying stoichiometries, in order to determine  whether the anomalous sign change of the Hall effect arises  from  vortex pinning or from charge acquired by the vortices. The  Hall  effect  and  vortex  correlations will also be  studied  using  a  Giaever  flux  transformer, which provides coupling  between  two  vortex  systems. A second dynamical regime that will  be  studied  arises   when   fluctuations   near  the   superconducting-normal  transition  in  zero  field  lead  to  time-varying  phases.  The  critical exponent parameters associated with this transition will  be  probed  with  a  comprehensive set of measurements,  from  DC  current-voltage    characteristics,    to    mutual    inductance  measurements  up  to 100kHz, to microwave response  measurements.  These  measurements will be done in thick (3-D) YBCO  samples  as  well  as  in progressively thinner samples, so that the crossover  to 2-D can be studied. This research program is interdisciplinary  in  nature  and  involves one or more postdoctoral  and  graduate  students,  who  receive  excellent training  in  preparation  for  careers in industry, government laboratories or academia.  %%%  This  basic experimental research project deals with the behavior  of   superconductors  which  are  not  in  the   ideal   lossless  supercurrent state. Electrical resistance can arise in a Type  II  superconductor  subjected to current  flow  and  to  an  external  magnetic field. In this case a Hall voltage of a puzzling  nature  can be observed, and is a focus of the present research. A second  regime  of  interest in the present work occurs for  temperatures  close  to  the critical transition temperature, where fluctuation  effect s  will  be studied. The work is primarily carried  out  on  high  Tc  materials. The Hall effect will be studied in NCCO  and  PCCO  superconductors  of varying stoichiometries,  in  order  to  determine  whether the anomalous sign change of the  Hall  effect  arises  from  vortex  pinning  or from  charge  acquired  by  the  vortices.  The Hall effect and vortex correlations will  also  be  studied using a Giaever flux transformer, which provides coupling  between   two   vortex  systems.  The  fluctuation  effects   are  characterized with a comprehensive set of measurements,  from  DC  current-voltage    characteristics,    to    mutual    inductance  measurements  up  to 100kHz, to microwave response  measurements.
