 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Technical Sciences Academy (TSA) was established through an NSF/ATE grant award in 1994. This new proposal builds on the solid foundation of the 1994-1997 project in the following ways: it will develop a new biotechnology program; strengthen its articulation agreements with its partner institutions; upgrade its technology resources; and enhance the teacher/faculty development program.    TSA has resulted in a highly successful partnership between Amarillo College (AC), Amarillo Independent School District (AISD), and leading area industries. The activities of the new proposal will elevate TSA to a regional/national model. Dual credit agreements between AC and AISD will be augmented. Articulation agreements will be negotiated among TSA, AC, and regional universities to further a seamless education from the ninth grade through a Baccalaureate degree.    Collaborative faculty development and teacher training efforts, directed toward pre-service and rural in-service teachers, will be implemented. Activities emphasizing technology applications will be available on-site and via ITV. The education/industry partnership procedures now implemented at TSA will be refined into a system and distributed through various means, including consultancies, on-site workshops, and Distance Learning applications. An outside evaluator will measure assessment/data collection integrity and outcomes completion.               Amarillo College lV",
