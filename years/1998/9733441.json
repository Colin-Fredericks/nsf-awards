Physiological  limitations  of jellyfish production rates are set  by  energetic  balance  as  individual  medusae  encounter,  and  move  between,  patches  of  concentrated food.  The aim of this research  is  to  understand  possible  limitations  to  jellyfish  production   in  coastal  ecosystems  in  the context of prey  productivity,  prey  patch distribution, and medusa behavior.  To accomplish this,  an  individual-based  energetics model will be  constructed  for  key  jellyfish  species  of  the northern Gulf  of  Mexico  (primarliy  Aurelia  aurita).  The model will incorporate in  situ-determined  behavior  as an adaptation for enhanced foraging, and  laboratory  and field-based characterization of the jellyfish energetics.   A  series of planned research cruises in the northern Gulf of Mexico  will  be  used  to refine the energetic parameters under  natural  feeding  conditions and to test the model's predictive  capacity.  Educational  and outreach components of this CAREER  program  are  broadly  targeted  at all ages. These include a `K-12  Discovery'  component  focussing  on  high-school  teacher  training  in  the  scientific  process,  a minority undergraduate  summer  mentoring  program, and a public outreach display at the Dauphin Island  Sea  Lab's  new  educational  `Estuarium'  illustrating  the  role  of  gelatinous zooplankton in structuring marine food webs.",
