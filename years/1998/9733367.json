 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733367  Lada    The recent results from near-infrared wavelength imaging surveys have of stars have suggested that most stars in our Galaxy form in the environments of dense, embedded stellar clusters.  The extent to which these new results should alter our current understanding of star formation physics is unclear.  However, one would expect to find fundamental differences in the formation and early evolution of young stars in such dense regions as compared to more isolated regions.  Therefore, establishing the properties of young stars in embedded clusters is essential to understanding the process of star formation and early stellar evolution and to estimate the overall likelihood of the existence of planetary systems in our Galaxy.   An extensive and systematic broad-band infrared and millimeter wavelength study of 11 young embedded, or partially embedded, stellar clusters will be conducted.  The stellar clusters range in age from 1 to 70 million years, and span a range of environment from gaseous hydrogen regions to reflection nebulae.  The main goals of the research are: 1) to construct and compare the near-infrared wavelength luminosity functions and Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams for each cluster and to investigate the shape and universality of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and  2) to determine and compare the frequency and mass distributions of circumstellar disks in each cluster.  In addition to providing a rich data base for investigations of the star forming histories of young clusters, the observations will provide, for the first time, a complete and statistically significant census of circumstellar/proto-planetary disk sources in cluster environments.  The comparison of the results of the analysis of the data for the stellar clusters with different ages will allow one to estimate the relative timescale for the disk phase of evolution within dense stellar environments.  The duration of the disk phase is of particular importance, for it sets the time scale for planet format ion.  The results can be compared to existing studies of young stars forming in relative isolation  This will be done in order to determine the differences in the formation and evolution of stars and their disks in differing astrophysical environments.     An integral part of this project is to carry out an educational and outreach plan that encourages, teaches, and mentors high school, college undergraduate and graduate students towards careers in the physical sciences.  The plan also emphasizes a science outreach program directed toward college level undergraduates, the general public and young children.  Specifically, it is planned to: 1)  Develop non-traditional teaching methods via the use of computers for the introductory level astronomy undergraduate course at the University of Florida; 2) Develop a new course on the origins of the solar system, stars, and life.  This course will integrate the results from recent research projects into the course material.  The course will be developed for both an undergraduate and graduate level.  3) A journal club on star formation and related topics will be organized;  4) Students will be involved at all levels in the research activities;  5) A women's career day symposium will be organized for the purpose of encouraging women high school students to consider careers in the physical sciences.   6) Two regular public lecture series will be organized, one for adults and one for children, on astronomical topics to encourage an interest and appreciation of astronomy and science in general among the public at all age levels.  ***",
