Waits  University of Idaho  Acquisition of Equipment for a Molecular Genetics Core  Facility for Research and Research Training in Conservation  Genetics and Molecular Ecology  This proposal supplies funds to equip a Molecular Genetics  Core Facility for research and training in the fields of  conservation genetics and molecular ecology.  This facility  will support a strong interdisciplinary program in  conservation biology, ecology, and natural resource  management at the University of Idaho.  Natural resources  sciences have reached a new era in basic and applied  research that requires the use of molecular genetic tools to  address specific questions that are critical for these  fields.  The rapid advancement in molecular biology  techniques and invention of automated DNA sequencing and  genotyping has enormously increased the productivity,  accuracy, and safety of these techniques.  The result of  this advancement is the opening of an exciting new realm of  research directions in the fields of conservation genetics,  molecular ecology, molecular systematics, and molecular  pathology.  The goals of this equipment grant are to develop  a Molecular Genetics Core Facility to expand and explore  research directions by 1) improving research capabilities,  2) developing a new level of interdisciplinary  collaboration, and 3) providing new research training and  educational opportunities in the areas of conservation  genetics, molecular ecology, molecular systematics, and  molecular pathology.  Three principal investigators, seven affiliated faculty, and  numerous graduate and undergraduate students will initially  share the proposed research facility.  The three principal  investigators have strong backgrounds in molecular genetic  research and span the major disciplines of the College -  plant, animal, and fisheries sciences.  The seven affiliated  faculty members have less molecular genetic experience, but  propose to expand their research to incorporate molecular  methods  when this facility is established.  The inclusion of  the affiliated faculty greatly expands the interdisciplinary  breadth of researchers using the facility and is important  for achieving our goal of providing new research training  opportunities for faculty and students who have had little  exposure to molecular genetic methods.",
