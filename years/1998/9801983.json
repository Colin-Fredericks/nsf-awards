Such a transition may occur for a disordered superconducting film  so  thin that its normal resistance per square is on the order of  h/4e2,  and  the  insulator like state  is  also  promoted  by  a  magnetic field. The research project involves in-situ evaporation  of  ultra  thin  layers  onto cryogenic substrates,  and  in-situ  measurements    of   magnetotransport,   STM    topography    and  spectroscopy. The goals are to establish correlations between the  macroscopic  transport  exhibiting the  SIT  transition  and  the  microscopic properties as revealed by the STM measurements. A key  issue  to  resolve  is  the  relative  importance  of  phase  and  amplitude fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter  in  the  vicinity  of  the  transition.  This  research  program   is  interdisciplinary  in nature and has typically  involved  several  undergraduate  and  graduate students in  its  activities.  These  involvements  are beneficial in the preparation of  students  for  further   study   and   for  careers  in   industry,   government  laboratories or academia.  %%%  This  experimental research project is concerned with  electrical  conduction  in  extremely  thin layers  of  metal,  at  very  low  temperature.  If the metal is a superconductor,  like  lead,  the  usual  behavior is a transition between a metallic  state  and  a  superconducting state, that is the resistance of the  metal  film  will go to zero below a transition temperature. However, when the  films  are  only a few atomic layers thick, an entirely different  behavior can be observed, in which a transition occurs between an  insulating  state  and  a  superconducting  state.  This  unusual  behavior is the focus of this project.  The experimental apparatus  allows  vacuum  deposit  of a metal layer onto  a  liquid-helium-  temperature substrate, so called quench condensing, which permits  the  ultra thin and even-thickness films that show the effect  of  interest.  The  experimental  apparatus  is  set  up   to   allow  electrical resistance measurements of the film to be made in  the  same apparatus, and also scanning tunneling microscope topographs  and electrical measurements to be made without disturbing the  as  deposited metal film. The temperature and magnetic field can also  be  varied. The goal of this basic research is to understand  the  mechanism  of  the  unusual insulator-superconductor  transition.  Such  understanding  will  add to the  overall  understanding  of  electrical  conduction in materials and also  in  microelectronic  and other devices. This research program is interdisciplinary  in  nature  and  has  typically  involved several  undergraduate  and  graduate  students  in  its activities.  These  involvements  are  beneficial in the preparation of students for further  study  and  for careers in industry, government laboratories or academia.  ***",
