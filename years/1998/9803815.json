 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803815  This research concerns models for concurrent computation. The  central problems are (1) building truly concurrent models for  concurrent languages, and (2) building models for unbounded  nondeterminism. Traditional models for concurrency resolve the  parallel composition of two processes into all possible  interleavings of the sequential actions of each. True concurrency  directly implements concurrent computation as a primitive  operator. This research will combine domain-theoretic approaches  with automata-theoretic techniques and trace theory to build new  models for concurrent computation based on true concurrency. The  goal is a better understanding of the difference between  nondeterminism and parallelism. Potential applications are models  of object-based concurrency and modeling the parallelization of  serial code. Applications to modeling security issues, especially  denial of service attacks are also being explored. A process is  unboundedly nondeterministic if it has infinitely many choices of  possible actions to perform. Models for this construct could be  used to extend existing models for bounded nondeterminism to ones  supporting unbounded nondeterminism. This would afford the  potential to reason about processes exhibiting unbounded finitary  behavior without also exhibiting infinitary behavior; for  example, a process which is capable of doing an action any finite  number of times, but incapable of doing it forever. Applications  involve specification and refinement, as well as fairness.***",
