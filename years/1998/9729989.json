 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this Doctoral Dissertation is to generate hypotheses indicating why levels of democracy vary within democratizing countries.  Scholars have largely ignored this empirical puzzle.  Secondary objectives of this project include preliminary testing of the hypotheses generated and an illumination of broader questions regarding a) different determinants of democracy at national and subnational levels, b) the relationship between democratic development at national and subnational levels, c) weaknesses in current conceptualizations of democracy, and d) the importance of subnational democracy.  To meet the objectives, the student collects data through interviews and printed material from four oblasts (provinces) in Russia and Kyrgyzstan. To explain subnational variation in democracy, the project compares two `more` democratic oblasts and contrasts them with two less `democratic` oblasts.  Based on an expert survey and background data, a more democratic and a less democratic oblast have been chosen from each country.  This dissertation research promises to contribute to the theoretical literature on democratization and to understand the factors which promote democracy in provinces or states where it is weak.",
