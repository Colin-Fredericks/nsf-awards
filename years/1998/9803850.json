 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with analysis and processing of  stochastic signals received at multiple sensors from  multiple sources with focus on blind equalization of digital  communications signals and on blind separation of  convolutive mixtures of independent sources (signals).  Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) models of digital  communication systems arise in a wide variety of  communications applications: high-speed digital subscriber  lines, multi-track digital magnetic recording,  multiuser/multi-access communications systems, digital radio  with diversity, dually polarized radio channels, multisensor  sonar/radar systems, etc. MIMO channel modeling allows for a  unified and optimal approach to design of MIMO  equalizers/filters/combiners for suppression of intersymbol  interference (ISI), cochannel and adjacent channel  interferences (CCI and ACI) and multi-access interferences  (MAI). State-of-the-art in this area requires complete  knowledge of the MIMO transfer function which is unrealistic  for practical communication systems.  In MIMO systems the training sequences must also be provided  by the interference-generating sources: an utterly  unrealistic assumption. One of the goals of this research  program is to provide more practical answers to the above  problems of great practical importance by removing the need  for training sequences for adaptive multichannel equalizer  design. Both second-order statistics-based and higher-order  statistics-based approaches are being investigated with  emphasis on the former. Emphasis is on approaches that  require as few assumptions as possible compared to existing  literature, e.g. common zeros among the subchannels are  allowed, the channel matrix impulse response can be  infinitely long, etc. The results of the proposed research  on blind source separation are expected to be useful to  scientists and engineers engaged in processing and analysis  of multisensor data in a broad class of applications such as  sonar, radar, acoustic array ap plications and monitoring of  power plants and civil works. The work on blind equalization  is expected to result in effective and computationally  efficient algorithms for signal processing in a broad class  of digital communication systems such as high-speed digital  subscriber lines, multi-track digital magnetic recording and  multiuser wireless communications.",
