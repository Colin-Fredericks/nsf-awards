 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project involves a student of Land Resources from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, studying the dynamics of irreversible deforestation for maize fields by hunter-gatherers of southwest Madagascar.  The project will analyze the processes of disequilibrium which drive the human ecosystem from one pattern of relative stability to another, and the impacts of this transition on the human-environmental interactions in the arid forest.  The study will consider changes in cultural identity, environmental knowledge, resource use and cash market participation.  The specific goals are to establish the spatial and temporal patterns of land use and deforestation in the forest spanning a fifty year historical period, to explore the political, economic and historical context of the patterns at the regional, national and international levels, to study the interaction of maize cultivation and local politics, cultural institutions and resource use.  Methods include participant observation, analysis of aerial photographs and satellite imagery, and rapid ethnographic rural appraisal.  The project will contribute to ecological anthropology theory and methods, to Malagasy ethnography, and to understanding of environmental conservation in similar situations throughout the world.",
