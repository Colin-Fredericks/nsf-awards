 "awd_abstract_narration": "The legume family is one of the most important groups of plants worldwide, as an important source of protein in the human diet, of fodder and forage crops for animals, of oil crops, and for available nitrogen in the biosphere.  Moreover, several crop legumes are among the best characterized plant genetic systems, with numerous classical genetic markers, well developed DNA marker maps, and basic tools for genome analysis.  Nevertheless, despite the investment of considerable resources from private and public sources, features such as large and complex genomes, and difficulties with introduction of foreign genes have severely limited the pace of molecular analysis in crop legumes.  In response to the need for a simple genetic system in legumes, investigators selected Medicago truncatula as a model species for legume biology.  Unlike the major crop legumes, Medicago truncatula is amenable to efficient molecular and genetic analyses and it is well suited for study of biological issues important to the related crop legume species.  \r\n\r\nThis project will undertake the large scale analysis of Medicago truncatula's total DNA, called its \"genome\".  In particular, a map of the organization of genes (comparative genomics), and of their functions in plant biology (functional genomics), are the emphases of this project.  Recent results from this research team document the first indications of conserved genome structure between Medicago truncatula and crop legumes and between Medicago truncatula and the well-characterized model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  Conserved genome structure between model plants and related crop species is significant because it is expected to accelerate the pace of cloning and characterization of agronomically important genes and traits.\r\n\r\nResearch activities conducted under this program will encompass the following approaches:  (1) comparative genomics, which will involve comparing the organization of genes between Medicago truncatula the crop legumes pea, alfalfa, and soybean, and the well-characterized model plant Arabidopsis thaliana; (2) functional genomics, which will involve constructing and characterizing a library of expressed gene sequences, and conducting large scale gene expression analysis to study gene function, and (3) bioinformatics, which will involve developing a database and database resources for analysis and dissemination of Medicago truncatula genome information.\r\n\r\nThe long term impact of this research will be to integrate genetic and functional information across legumes, and thereby expand opportunities for basic and applied research in economically important legume species.  This research will allow scientists to compare genes of agronomic and scientific interest in Medicago truncatula and the related crop legumes.  This knowledge will enable more efficient cloning and characterization of valuable genes and traits, such as disease resistance and crop productivity, and it will ultimately facilitate the development of improved crop varieties.  The database of expressed genes generated by this research will enable the detailed analysis of the role of specific genes in plant growth and development.  Many of the genes identified in the course of this research will become the focus of crop improvement strategies and of continued scientific investigation by legume biologists.  The proposed work benefits enormously from previous NSF-sponsored research on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  Likewise, completion of the project will benefit not only research on legumes, but the broader scientific community as well.\r\n",
