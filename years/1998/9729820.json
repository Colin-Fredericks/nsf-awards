 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Swaney - 9729820  Formulating and solving process simulation models is divided between setting up the models and then obtaining solutions numerically.  The status of modelling and user interfaces has undergone advances in recent years.  The performance of available numerical algorithms is less adequate relative to the task required.  Complex process models may be difficult to solve, yet these can lead to the best technology.    This research will develop a new method for the numerical solution of large scale steady state process simulation models.  The need is for a robust method to solve the significantly nonlinear process models that arise.  The modeller should not be required to supply initial guesses, but should be provided with an unambiguous mechanism to diagnose model misformulations.  This approach is to express each process subsystem model as a variational problem.  Domain constraints such as variable nonnegativity are directly enforced.  Solving the coupled subsystems then becomes a problem in noncooperative equilibria, and may be solved as an equilibrium programming problem.  In this form, rigorous existence theorems may be invoked.  A new pseudo-physical homotopy-based solution procedure will be tested.  By navigating nonsmooth points and bifurcations along the path, solution attainment is provable.",
