 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research, carried out in an undergraduate setting, is   the preparation and utilization of alkyliodonium derivatives,   perfluoroalkyl iodonium salts, benziodoxoles, cyclic derivatives of   pentavalent iodine, and new compounds of lead(IV) and Xenon(II).  The   long-term goals of the research include: (i) the extension and   improvement of basic knowledge on the structure and reactivity of   polyvalent iodine compounds, (ii) the creation of new reagents and of   procedures suitable for organic synthesis, and (iii) the search for   reaction products with useful applications. With this renewal Research in   Undergraduate Institutions award, the Organic and Macromolecular   Chemistry Program is supporting the research efforts of Dr. Viktor V.   Zhdankin of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota,   Duluth.  With his undergraduate  colleagues, Dr. Zhdankin will focus his   work on the synthesis of new structural types of trivalent and   pentavalent iodine with the goal of developing new reagents for organic   synthesis.",
