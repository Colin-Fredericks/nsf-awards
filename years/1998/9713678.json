 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Skidaway Institute of Oceanography is a small,  autonomous research unit of the University System of  Georgia, with 15 research faculty and 40 permanent support  staff.  It was established in 1967 with the mandate to  conduct research in all fields of oceanography and the  marine sciences and to serve as a base of operations and  central facility for any of the research and educational  institutions in the State of Georgia.  This mandate and the  Institute's remote pristine location, convenient to coastal  and shelf waters, guarantee a constant influx of visiting  scientists and student seeking access to Skidaway's  state-of-the-art research facilities, accessible research  locations, and opportunities for collaboration with  Skidaway's interdisciplinary and internationally-recognized  research faculty.    Four older housing units are at least fifty years old and  are in need of substantial repair and restoration to  maintain their current habitability.  Among the necessary  tasks for this project are: replacing the elderly shingle  roofs of all four units; removing three units from septic  tank systems and connecting them to the sewer system;  replacing windows in one unit; re-siding and insulating two  units; bringing all four unit up to code in fire safety with  the inclusion of firewalls and hardwired fire alarms;  upgrading electrical service to two units; replacing  decrepit kitchen and bathroom facilities in two units; and  completing plumbing upgrades in all four units.",
