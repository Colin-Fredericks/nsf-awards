 "awd_abstract_narration": "For many years now, the percentage of PhDs in mathematics granted  to women in the United States has been at least 20% of the total.  There are many colleges and universities in which half the  mathematics majors are women.  However, there is an observed lack  of women at the most visible, highest levels of research,  teaching and management.  This is often explained as a time-lag,  with the assumption that the numbers of women university  professors and mathematical leaders will come in the future to  reflect the demographics of the student populations.  There are  positive signs, as many mathematics departments now have one or  two female professors, there have been women presidents of all  the major professional organizations, and several of the most  renowned industrial research groups are headed by women.  At  least three of the twenty prestigious Sloan postdoctoral research  fellowships each year go to women, and the statistics of the  National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowships are even  better.    There are, however, some signs that the situation overall is not  as healthy as it might be.  The numbers of women at research  institutes like the Institute for Advanced Study and the  Mathematical Sciences Research Institute are not up to the 20%  figure, probably partly as the most prestigious schools do not  uniformly have many women enrolled (we find that there are only  three women in graduate school in mathematics at Princeton  University right now.)  In particular, the IAS/Park City  Mathematics Institute Summer Session has had difficulty  attracting representative numbers of women.  The Mentoring  Program for Women in Mathematics is a ten-day workshop designed  to prepare students for the summer session of the PCMI.  The  workshop includes lectures, seminars, problem sessions and  exposure to a variety of scientists.  It is set up to encourage  both peer group mentoring and networking, as well as interaction  between four or five levels of participants.  The short-term  goal i s to gather young women mathematicians together in a  challenging and supportive environment.  This incidentally  provides a basis for an active women's network as well as an  introduction to the scholars in residence at the Institute for  Advanced Study of a spirited, serious and enthusiastic group of  young women.  The long-term goal is to help increase the number  of women professional mathematicians in this country by providing  information, senior role models and an excellent research  environment for young female mathematics students.    In the years 1994, 1995, and 1996, the short-term goal of the  proposal has been realized very successfully.  The written  comments of participants in the program are overwhelmingly  positive and speak of concrete advantages provided to the  participants: intellectual advances, contacts with women  mathematicians, increased self-confidence and, in some cases, the  decision to pursue a professional career in mathematics.  It is  too soon to judge if the long-term goal of the program will be  realized, but we are encouraged by the number of participants who  have made a return visit to the program at a later stage of their  careers.
