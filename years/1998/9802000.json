Of  principal  interest are low-dimensional and/or geometrically frustrated spin  systems. Of interest are conditions for the formation/absence  of  spin  freezing,  the role of frustration, and effects  of  charge  doping  and  magnetic dilution. In more detail, four  topics  and  systems  of  interest  are: 1) questions of ordering  temperature  and/or ordered moment size in quasi 1-d zig-zag spin chain    SrCuO2  and LixV2O5; 2) charge/vacancy doping effects in  2-leg  ladders Sr2(Cu,Zn)4O6, LaCuO2.5, and (Ca,Mg)(V,Ti)2O5; 3)  ground  state  of  pure  and  perturbed geometrically frustrated  systems  LiV2O4, (Y,Sc)Mn2, CePt2Sn2; and 4) magnetic properties of linear  chains  and 2-leg ladders in the hybrid (La,Sr,Ca)14Cu24O41.  The  muon   spin  relaxation  experiments  are  performed  at  TRIUMF,  magnetic  susceptibility  measurements at  Columbia  and  neutron  scattering   studies   at  JAERI.  This   research   program   is  interdisciplinary in nature and involves one or more graduate  or  postgraduate   students,  who  receive  excellent   training   in  preparation  for careers in industry, government laboratories  or  academia.  %%%  This  experimental basic research project is devoted  to  unusual  magnetic  behavior  in  crystalline specimens  of  a  variety  of  inorganic chemical compounds. The questions of interest  are  the  local  behavior  of the magnetic species in the samples,  and  an  advanced  experimental method called \"muon  spin  relaxation\"  is  used  in  this work. The measurement has to be made at a  special  accelerator  facility where the muons (mu mesons),  are  produced  and injected into the sample of interest. The measurement reveals  the magnetic field strength inside the sample at those loca tions,  often  near  internal magnetic moments, where  the  muons  become  trapped before they undergo decay. Of interest are conditions for  the  formation/absence of spin freezing, the role of frustration,  and  effects  of  charge doping and magnetic  dilution.  In  more  detail, four topics and systems of interest are: 1) questions  of  ordering temperature and/or ordered moment size in quasi 1-d zig-  zag  spin  chain  SrCuO2  and LixV2O5; 2)  charge/vacancy  doping  effects   in   2-leg   ladders   Sr2(Cu,Zn)4O6,   LaCuO2.5,   and  (Ca,Mg)(V,Ti)2O5;   3)  ground  state  of  pure   and   perturbed  geometrically frustrated systems LiV2O4, (Y,Sc)Mn2, CePt2Sn2; and  4)  magnetic properties of linear chains and 2-leg ladders in the  hybrid  (La,Sr,Ca)14Cu24O41.The muon spin relaxation  experiments  are performed at TRIUMF, magnetic susceptibility measurements  at  Columbia and neutron scattering studies at JAERI. The results  of  this research will be of importance in magnetism, and in physical  theory.  They  may  lead to new methods that can  be  applied  in  chemistry  and  in  nanoscale electronic devices.  This  research  program  is interdisciplinary in nature and involves one or  more  graduate or postgraduate students, who receive excellent training  in  preparation for careers in industry, government  laboratories  or academia.  ***",
