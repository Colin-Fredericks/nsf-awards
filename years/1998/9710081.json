 "awd_abstract_narration": "My research interests are in the design of experiments and  the  development of statistically meaningful yet computationally  tractable estimation methods for compartmental models.    Compartmental models provide a valuable tool in analyzing  a wide variety of problems, such as the the kinetics of drugs  through a body or the flow of nutrients through an ecosystem via  the design of  tracer experiments.  In most cases,  cost and/or feasibility  are issues when designing a tracer  experiment since such experiment is often non-repeatable due to  high cost, ethical issues,  or possible damage to the organism.  Nonetheless, the careful design of an experiment involving  compartmental models can be accomplished through proper  collaboration between the scientist who has  understanding  of the biological or physiological  mechanism of the system  and the compartmental analyst who has knowledge of the   mathematical and computational issues that arise in the  identifiability and stability of the parameters or flow rates  which describe the system.    Once a model, deemed reasonable for the process under study,     has been proposed, the objective is to estimate the parameters   of the model from a set of observations gathered through time.  However,  the commonly-occurring non-constant variance of  biological data and/or the presence of outlying observations  discourage standard application of ordinary least squares  or  equally weighted L_2 estimation.  Although  L_1-norm estimation  would reduce the influence of outliers, for statistical reasons,  it is generally not preferred.   To obtain statistically optimal  estimators, workers often perform weighted least squares using   empirical  weights, iteratively reweighted least squares,  or  transform the data and/or  the model often using  the logarithm  transformation.    However, in practice, the optimal weights are not known, thus  application of weighted or iteratively reweighted  least squares  is not straightforward.  Moreover, methods involving  current  transformation methodology, such as Box-Cox transformations,  while succeeding in stabilizing the variance, often do not yield  a computationally more desirable problem to solve.  My immediate  research consists of investigating the use and properties of  integral transform methods in estimation.  Such integral  transform  should be  `natural' to a given problem; natural,  in  that applying such transformation should yield a problem which  would be computationally no more  costly than current methods but  more amenable to the model, in that such transformation should  stabilize the variance yet be computationally simple.  Currently,  I am looking at these issues with the Laplace transform applied  to linear time invariant compartmental models.",
