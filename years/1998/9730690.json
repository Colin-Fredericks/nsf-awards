 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730690  Bradley    Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will continue development of a   deep sea autonomous vehicle (AUV) capability that will provide a   platform for a variety of sensors of interest to the ocean science   community.  A new undersea vehicle builds on the work and   experience gained during development of the Autonomous Benthic   Explorer (ABE) which is a prototype, designed and constructed to   test engineering concepts while attempting to provide a useful   capability for the deep sea research community. The ABE vehicle has   characteristics which make it ideally suited for long term   deployment of a variety of off-the-shelf sensors coupled with the   precision navigation and control capabilities necessary to obtain a   complete co-registered data set. However, ABE is not well suited   for short-term routine utilization. Based on scientific and   logistical requirements, there is a need for an ABE-like AUV   specifically designed for routine short-duration operations to   occur simultaneously with more traditional scientific vehicles,   such as ALVIN, Jason and towed instrumentation platforms.   Significant design changes are required to create a vehicle that   will meet these requirements, including 1) improved floatation,   durability and efficiency of design to allow for frequent launch   and recovery,  and 2) alteration of the navigation system to allow   many vehicles to operate simultaneously using the same transponder   net.  A second-generation ABE will be suitable for continuous daily   operations and will be economical to operate.    This project is to design and construct a second generation ABE   vehicle (called \"Sentry ) along with continued development of   capabilities desired by the science community. The new vehicle will   maintain the characteristics needed by science community. However,   Sentry will be better suited for routine deployment by a small   operations team for longer periods of time than with the present   vehicle. Sentry should be able to m eet the requirements of the   science programs presently hoping to utilize ABE and, its   operational costs should be low enough to attract additional   investigators.",
