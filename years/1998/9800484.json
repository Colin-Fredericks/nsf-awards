 "awd_abstract_narration": "This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to the University of   Texas at Austin supports the research of Professor David A. Vanden Bout.    The theme of the research is the effects of interfacial chemistry and   material heterogeneities on electronic and optical properties of   luminescent conjugated polymers at metal interfaces.  Near-field scanning   optical microscopy (NSOM) combined with time-resolved spectroscopy will   be used to probe polymer/metals interfaces directly.  The NSOM will be   coupled with ultrafast laser spectroscopy to include time-resolved   measurements of the optical properties.  Properties of particular   interest include the migration and trapping of energy and fundamental   excitations as well as localized photochemistry.  Although inexpensive and reliable organic electronic devices have existed   for years, poor durability and short lifetimes have limited the success   of these devices.  By probing the small region of polymer/metal   interfaces directly, these studies will yield new insight into the   workings and failures of organic devices such as polymer light-emitting   diodes.",
