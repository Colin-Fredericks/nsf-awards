To support the aforementioned projects, the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago will purchase state-of-the-art computing equipment dedicated to supporting multidisciplinary research in computer and information science and engineering. The equipment will be used for several research projects cited above.    The primary objective of this proposal is to acquire a high-performance multiprocessor and two workstations which will enable performing highly cpu-intensive finite-element simulations with reasonable turn-around time. The server will provide the performance necessary for simulations of a complexity and accuracy not permitted with conventional desktop workstations.  This equipment will support over 20 graduate students and one faculty member in their research.",
