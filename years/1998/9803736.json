 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first wave of a multi-wave survey study of the impact of the new \"covenant marriage\" law in Louisiana.  On August 15, 1997, Louisiana made an historical change in its domestic relations laws.  Couples wishing to marry must now choose between two systems; the traditional form of marriage governed by unrestricted access to no-fault divorce, and covenant marriage. A covenant marriage requires that a couple first receive premarital counseling about the seriousness of the lifetime commitment, the legal obligation to seek marital counseling if problems arise, and the restrictive grounds for divorce or legal separation. Divorce from a covenant marriage requires proof of receiving marital counseling. The grounds for dissolving the covenant marriage are the traditional fault grounds: adultery, physical or sexual cruelty to the other spouse or the child of either or both, and imprisonment at hard labor for a felony, plus separation for a lengthy period. For less serious problems, permanent separation is available.    The intent of this law is to make marriage a more enduring commitment by requiring premarital and marital counseling and by making divorce more difficult. The law is also intended to foster public discourse about the institution of marriage by focusing attention on the seriousness and enduring nature of it. In time, such public dialogue is expected to promote a more sober and considered understanding of the commitments and obligations in marriage. This research will evaluate both goals through a cross-section survey of Louisiana residents. In so doing, it will answer central questions in sociological theories of divorce.",
