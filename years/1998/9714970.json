 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jimmie Doll from Brown University and David Freeman from University of   Rhode Island are supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue their research on the   influence of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions on the dynamics of   interfacial hydrogen.   Doll and Freeman have developed a dynamical path   integral theory for adsorbate vibrational lineshapes and applied it to   studies of Hydrogen adsorbed on various metal surfaces such as Ni(111).    Results using the embedded atom model have been used to elucidate   experimental results obtained from vibrational spectroscopy.  The current   research program builds upon these results by  improving upon the   interaction potentials through the use of ab initio electronic structure   calculations.  The embedded cluster methods developed by Whitten and   coworkers at North Carolina State University  will be employed to develop   more realistic ab initio interaction potentials for use in the dynamical   path integral calculations.  Applications will include studies of   Hydrogen on Ni(111), Ni(110), Cu(110) and W(110) as well as   delocalization of hydrogen adsorption on Ni, Cu and W clusters.  The   calculations will be used to interpret experimental data obtained by   Peter Weber of Brown University.  Hydrogen storage in metals and hydrogen embrittlement are important   technological problems. The fundamental work of Doll and Freeman has a   very good probability of providing significant theoretical insights into   a molecular based understanding of these phenomena.",
