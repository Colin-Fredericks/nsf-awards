The PI will develop competency in using video data analysis technology by working with the researchers at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) who developed the techniques, then use the technology to analyze existing and forthcomning data on science learners; sociocognitive processes.  She also will establish substantive links to the research programs of social scientist at UCLA who develop large scale assessments of science teaching and learning.  In these ways, the PI will deepen and broaden her ability to make contributions to science education theory and practice.",
