 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract/Prasad, 9714810    It is difficult to make good observations in real clouds.  At best, using  aircraft, balloons, and radar, researchers have been able to get a few  \"snapshots\" of what is going on in a limited region of a aq few clouds at  particular instants, but to do so is very costly and difficult.  Thus our  knowledge of cloud processes is very spotty and limited.  The difficulty of  getting good observations of real clouds has led a number of  investigators to try to get at an understanding of cloud processes by  studying analogs of cloud processes in laboratory simulations using  liquids.  Although there are some problems inherent in this approach  because of differences between liquids and air (liquids are generally  virtually incompressible, for example), there are still many questions that  may be addressed usefully in this way.  One of these is the question of  entrainment of environmental dry air into clouds.  This award supports  research using a laboratory analog of a buoyant developing cloud to  address the problem of entrainment.   The release of latent heat in a  cloud by condensation will be simulated by injecting heat ohmically, that  is, through heated wires in the fluid flow.  The flow fields will be  visualized using some of the most recent advanced techniques, including  Laser Induced Fluorescence, Particle Image Velocimetry,  and Particle Image Thermometry.  The planned research is expected to  provide new and fresh insights about entrainment, and to lead to  improvements in the characterization of buoyant convection and  entrainment in numerical models of clouds.",
