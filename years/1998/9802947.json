 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with the study of the relationship between a geodesic flow on a Riemannian manifold on the one hand, and the asymptotic properties of the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the other hand.  The principal investigator proposes to continue his study of the asymptotic behavior of the eigenfunctions on manifolds with either completely integrable or ergodic geodesic flows.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research lies in the area of Quantum Chaos.  The subject originated in the study of the spectra of the atomic nuclei in the fifties.  Later it was recognized that similar phenomena occur in condensed matter physics, disordered systems, ergodic theory, random matrices, and analytic number theory.  The questions which are often considered include the study of the spacings between high energy levels of the system: do they behave like random numbers, or are they more regular? Other questions concern eigenfunctions: do they become uniformly distributed over the phase space or do they become highly concentrated in certain regions?  Many experiments suggest that the answers depend on the classical dynamics of the system. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the precise nature of that dependence, but many mathematical questions remain unsolved. The questions considered in this proposal are related to the problems that arise in building certain components of quantum computers.\r\n\r\n",
