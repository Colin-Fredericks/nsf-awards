 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant funds a one-year exploratory research effort to seek new strategies to simplify the material flow network that exists in a facility after it has implemented the best possible facility layout.  The research will evaluate algorithms that could automate the implementation of simplification strategies.  Such strategies assume that, when a facility layout is designed for a facility using a travel chart, several flows in the chart will be forced to occur between non-adjacent departments that do not share a common boundary.  Examples of strategies that could eliminate, simplify or reduce the non-adjacent flows include: change the part mix produced in the facility, eliminate the offending operations, modify the operation sequences of the parts, create cells to completely process one or more parts, replace one or more cells with multi-function machining centers, and merge two or more departments.  This research will evaluate string clustering and matching algorithms used in non-engineering domains such as genetics and biology to implement these strategies.       If successful, the benefits that could result from this research include reduced material flow between non-adjacent departments, the ability to make machining equipment purchases based on logical grouping of dissimilar machines into cells, and the ability to eliminate flows between non-adjacent departments in the layout.  These benefits would lead to more efficient manufacturing of many products.",
