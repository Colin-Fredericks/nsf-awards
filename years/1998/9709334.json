 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: CMS-9709334, Pedro deAlba & Jean Benoit, University of  New Hampshire    When a saturated sand deposit is shaken by an earthquake, there  can be a  significant build-up of pore-water pressure, with consequent loss  of  rigidity and strength of the soil, often ending in actual  liquefaction of  the deposit, and major damage to structures. While pore-pressure  buildup  has been simulated in laboratory experiments, there is only one  case  currently available in which the development of these pore  pressures to the  point of liquefaction was measured in a field deposit under  earthquake-induced strong-ground shaking. Unfortunately, the pore  pressure  records obtained in this case have certain unusual features, which  has led  some researchers to question their validity. Consequently, it is  of primary  importance to geotechnical earthquake engineers to obtain more  records, in  order to provide a final verification of mathematical models  developed on  the basis of laboratory and centrifuge testing.    This research project involves an extensive laboratory and field  study of  piezometer designs in current use. In the laboratory, piezometer  installation will be simulated in a test chamber, and piezometer  response  to dynamic pore pressure increases will be measured both in water  alone and  in saturated soil. Acceptable procedures for design, saturation  and  installation of piezometers will thus be identified. In the second  phase, a  field installation for periodically checking piezometer response  will be  developed. These second-phase tests will provide insight into the  problem  of response changes, if any, due to long-term biological or  chemical  interaction with the surrounding soil.    The outcome of this project will be a set of guidelines for the  design,  manufacture, installation and long-term monitoring of piezometer  arrays  designed to obtain much-needed field data on pore pressure  development  during earthquakes.    This project is being coordinated with a complementa ry research  program  headed by Dr. Behnam Hushmand of Hushmand Associates, California.",
