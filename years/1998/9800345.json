 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800345  Ehsani  Fiber Reinforced Composites (FRP) are fast becoming a viable  new construction material.  Perhaps the most suitable area  of application for these materials is in the field of  strengthening and rehabilitation of existing civil  structures.  Numerous field applications have demonstrated  that FRPs can result in some 30% cost savings compared to  conventional rehabilitation techniques.    The success of the technique depends to great extend on the  quality of the construction, and in particular, the epoxy  joint which had to transfer the stresses from the FRP plate  to the substrate.  Consequently, there is a great need for  development of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques  which could detect any flaws or delaminations in the epoxy  bond line.  Such a system could not only be used to ensure  quality of construction, but could also help with detection  of any damage that may form during the life of the structure  by environmental effects such as ultraviolet rays, moisture  penetration, etc.    The quality of rehabilitation will be monitored  nondestructively by ultrasonic inspection of internal  defects, voids and delaminations, when the specimen is not  homogeneous, such as a composite layer that is to be used,  evaluation of interfaces between two different materials or  layers is a much harder job.  It is specially difficult if  the two interfaces are debonded or weakly bonded but are in  close contact with each other forming what is called  \"kissing\" or \"slip\" bonds.    Hence for this applicaiton the Lamb wave scanning technique  appears to be the superior technique.  ***",
