 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are many animals that show seasonal changes in  metabolism and reproduction, demonstrating a link between the  nervous system and hormonal system.  There also is a prominent  seasonal incidence of infectious disease in animals as well as  humans.  Seasonal changes in immune function have been shown in  many field studies on mammals, and a few lab studies on wild  species such as deer mice and voles.  Many immunological tools  exist to study the relation of immune function in laboratory mice,  but lab mice are not responsive to environmental factors that  drive seasonality changes in wild populations.  Immunological  techniques for species like deer mice and voles are largely  limited to relatively nonspecific basic cellular processes.  There  are some pilot data that show Siberian hamsters, a non-laboratory  strain with well-known seasonal physiological changes regulated by  the neuroendocrine system, have some immune parameters enhanced by  a long-term exposure to short day lengths.  This project is a  Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) for technical  development of state-of-the art immunological techniques that will  work on these hamsters and other non-traditional and wild rodents.  Novel antibody reagents will be identified and used to establish  highly sensitive and sophisticated methods to identify immune cell  types and to quantify their production of immunological products.     The likely impact of the results is very high, because the new  technical developments will clarify basic mechanisms of  neuorimmune interactions, specifically how immune responsiveness  is adapted to seasonal challenges encountered by most mammals in  the real world outside the laboratory.  The new methodologies can  be applied to a wide diversity of immune cell responses across  species, with potential contributions also to veterinary care and  to maintaining endangered species.",
