The equipment will be used to pursue studies of new, innovative antennas for several research projects, including studies of dielectric resonator antennas, cylindrical wire antenna scatterers in multi-layeted media, antenna for a ground coupled radar, and meander and spiral antennas for wireless communication.\r\nRF and Microwave technology has been used and is being proposed for a variety of military and commercial applications based on the rapid growth of wireless and personal communication usage.  The availability of reasonably priced components and propagation characteristics in the RF and GHz. range are, however, contributing factors for the rapid growth of RF and wireless applications in this country.  Personal communications systems have generated a great deal of interest by industry and research organizations with a need for new antenna technology.  As a result, this group of six faculty members has been very active in the development of dielectric resonators for communications applications.  This has led us to begin research related to the development of technologies for the design and application of dielectric resonators for microwave networks and antennas.  It is foreseen that the proposed equipment is required for the study of new types of dielectric resonators for use as antennas for future applications.  In addition, the investigation of now meander and spiral-type antennas for RF and wireless applications has been initiated to discover new antenna configurations for these applications\r\nIn another research project, a multi-wire, cage model has been developed to solve the important problem of the determination of the radiation pattern and longitudinal current distribution along and around a wire antenna protruding through a multi-layer medium.  This research is of significant merit because the longitudinal directed current distribution on a wire antenna near the interface between two layered medium is not uniform as a function of angle around the antenna because of proximity effects, and current simulation programs cannot model these structure's accurately.  In this research, directed towards investigation of a more accurate simulation model for these type wire structures, several different cases are being analyzed using a cage model used in this research for verification of a model, and antenna current distributions, impedance, and radiation patterns are to be measured for discovering the characteristics of this class of wire antenna structures in the presence of lossy media.\r\nThe fourth project that is currently under investigation is a study of an optimized antenna for a ground coupled radar system for location of unexploded artillery shells and mines.  The location of unexploded munitions is currently a high priority area of interest, and this research is being pursued in an effort to discover new technology for the solution of this widely recognized problem.\r\nThe proposed equipment is to provide a wide-band microwave receiving system (<20GHz) for magnitude and phase measurements of current and charge distribution, input and mutual impedance, and radiation patterns for the advancement of antenna technology by this research group.  'Me availability of this equipment, which includes the proposed receiver and University of Mississippi provided signal source and test set, will have a significant impact on the quality and type of research that can be pursued for creating new knowledge antennas, as well as on the level of instruction for training engineers for the future with backgrounds in RF, wireless, and microwave technology.\r\n\r\n",
