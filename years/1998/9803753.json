 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803753\r\nLevermore\r\n\r\nThis proposal is comprised of six otherwise disparate projects with the \r\nunifying theme of investigating how collective large-scale behavior arises \r\nin multi-scale dynamical systems. The projects are: Zero Dispersion \r\nLimits of Nonlinear Wave Equations, Macroscopic Lattice Dynamics, the \r\nNLS Limit of the CGL Equation, Moment Closure Hierarchies for Kinetic \r\nEquations, Numerical Schemes for Hyperbolic Systems, and Shallow-\r\nWater Models.  From a physical perspective this proposed effort could be \r\nviewed as a study of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics.  But it is more \r\nthan that, for it strives to discover and study new nonlinear phenomena \r\nthat could impact the way physical, geophysical, and biological models are \r\ndeveloped and simulated.\r\n\r\nNew technologies are entering regimes in which traditional mathematical \r\nmodels are inadequate.  For example, quantum mechanical effects play a \r\ncentral role in the emerging nanoscale semiconductor technology.  These \r\neffects are absent from traditional device models. Including them often \r\nleads to models with \"small dispersion.\"  Such models exhibit large-scale \r\nbehaviors that are not understood and are hard to simulate because they \r\nresult from collective smaller-scale phenomena.  Current mathematics is \r\nnot up to the task of describing or simulating such things adequately.  The \r\nfirst and second projects of this proposal address the development of \r\nmathematics that can do the job.  The other projects of the proposal \r\naddress the need for other mathematical developments that would impact \r\nnanoscale semiconductor design, hypersonic flight, epidemiological \r\nmodels, ocean circulation models, and other technologies.\r\n",
