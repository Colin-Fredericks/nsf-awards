The PI will review every issue page by page and item by item, and construct a chronicle of the events of those decades, drawing on his personal and unique acquaintance with the publication and his involvement in the events and the people described.  Cumulations of the work will be issued every six months on CD/ROM or DVD discs and the work will be announced in the Annals of the History of Computing and other appropriate publications.",
