 "awd_abstract_narration": "9734478  Spalding  Ion channels are protein molecules that conduct electrically charged atoms or groups of atoms (ions) across the oily, lipid bilayer of cellular membranes.  Recent research has shown that ion transport by channels is an important component of the mechanisms plants use to detect signals such as hormones, light, gravity, and temperature.  Dr. Spalding proposes experiments that will test whether a gene the PIs have recently cloned encodes the chloride channel that the PIs have found to function in the detection of light cues important to seedling growth and development.  The cloning of such a gene would enable the amalgamation of molecular genetic and biophysical techniques,  creating unique opportunities to advance the PI's understanding of how the environment influences the growth and development of plants.  The seedling root will be the focus of the present work because the chloride channel just mentioned is also necessary for the formation of root hairs, specialized cells important to the task of absorbing nutrients and water from the soil.  Also to be performed are experiments designed to determine the role of the AKT1 channel in the uptake of potassium, an essential element, by roots of the Arabidopsis plant.  A mutant plant lacking the AKT1 gene will be used in an unprecedented combination of genetic and biophysical studies of this agronomically important uptake process.  For the educational component of this proposal, Dr. Spalding will develop laboratory exercises that will enhance the teaching of ion channels and membrane transport in the plant physiology curriculum.  A reference manual will be prepared and distributed freely to interested educators.",
