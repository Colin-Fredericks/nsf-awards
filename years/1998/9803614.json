Bechtold\r\n\r\nThis work proposes to systmatically derive generalized mathematical \r\nmodels of premixed flame propagation through a variety of flow \r\nconditions.  Asymptotic methods will be employed to extract reduced \r\nmodels from a complete set of equations governing combustion processes.\r\nOf interest will be to account for flow conditions that are characteristic \r\nof turbulent flows.  Specific models will include the following phenomena:\r\nunsteady flame structure, flow fields with concentration and thermal \r\ngradients, and multi-component mixtures.  These reduced models possess \r\na tremendous advantage over the full set of equations in that they \r\npermit direct analysis of salient features characterizing practical \r\ncombustion systems.  Therefore, it is further proposed that these new \r\nmodels will be used to analyze simplified flame-flow configurations that \r\nretain some of the essential features of turbulent reacting flows, including  \r\nunsteadiness and non-uniformities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost practical combustion systems, including internal combustion engines, \r\nrocket engines and incinerators, operate in a turbulent regime.  The study \r\nof combustion in these environments provides valuable information on such \r\nimportant issues as efficiency and emissions.  These systems are very \r\ncomplicated and are governed by huge sets of equations that are too large \r\nto be solved even by the most sophisticated numerical techniques. Scientific \r\nprogress in these directions relies on the development of simplified \r\nmathematical models; that is, reduced systems that retain the most essential \r\nfeatures of the combustion process, but that permit direct analysis.  The \r\nwork proposed here involves the systematic derivation of flame models to \r\nstudy flame propagation in a wide range of flow conditions, including \r\ntime-dependent and non-uniform flows.  Of particular interest will be \r\nto calculate burning rates and to identify conditions for which flames \r\nwill be extinguished.\r\n\r\n",
