 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY    Expansion of the AAAS Senior Scientists and Engineers Program    The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) is seeking to broaden the scope and impact of its Senior Scientists and Engineers (SSE) program though a two-year project.  SSE was established as a cooperative effort of leading scientific, engineering, and medical societies to make available to government, educational institutions, and local communities the expertise of retired scientists, engineers, and other professionals.    AAAS Proposes to expand SSE (1) by establishing a pilot project to assist the National Science Foundation's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program; (2) by establishing a new SSE chapter outside of the Washington, DC area; (3) by producing a guidebook that illustrates the process involved in developing a successful SSE chapter; (4) by improving the SSE membership database; (5) by increasing SSE membership within the Washington metropolitan region; and (6) by creating an SSE World Wide Web home page.  of the grant.    The expected outcomes of the project include a significant increase in the membership of the SSE organization, increased efficiency in providing volunteers to local communities, more effective utilization of SSE volunteers' expertise, timely and skillful evaluation of SBIR proposals, establishment of a new SSE chapter, and publication of a guidebook for developing new SSE chapters.",
