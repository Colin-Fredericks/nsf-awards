 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to investigate how children, adolescents, and adults make judgments about including or excluding people from activities on the basis of their group membership. As an example: Is it legitimate for an all-girl ballet club to exclude a boy who wants to join? In general, the research is designed to investigate how social knowledge, including social stereotypes, develops across childhood and into adulthood, as well as to study how and when this knowledge is brought to bear upon judgments in children and adults. This is a collaborative project designed to link a well-developed literature on social and moral reasoning from developmental psychology with conceptions of stereotypes and intergroup relations as developed by social psychologists. The research is based on the assumption that social stereotypes play a much broader role in how people think about group relations than has usually been considered by social psychologists. It is proposed that stereotypes may serve to justify social actions, in addition to influencing judgments about and behavior toward individuals. In the research, individuals will be asked to judge hypothetical scenarios in which one person excludes another person from an activity which is known to invoke stereotypes. It is expected that when principles of fairness, equity, and rights are brought to bear on such judgments, the decisions and behaviors will be non-exclusionary, and consistently so across a variety of situations. When social-conventional reasoning, including beliefs about group functioning and social stereotypes, is used as a basis of decision-making, decisions are expected to be exclusionary, group-specific, and highly contingent upon the current social context. It is anticipated that the findings of this research will provide valuable information for teachers, educators, social workers, and school psychologists who are confronted with intergroup tension in interactions among children, adolescents, and adults in a multitude of settings.",
