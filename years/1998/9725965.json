 "awd_abstract_narration": "Donald Truhlar is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his work on chemical dynamics   and energetics.  Three areas of research are proposed: 1) development of   an improved theoretical framework for the analysis and prediction of   photochemical reactions; 2) development of improved methods for treating   quantum dynamical effects in condensed-phase chemical reactions; and 3)   improved methods for the quantum mechanical treatment of the properties   and dynamics of small clusters.  Major objectives of the research   include: 1) To analyze the accuracy of trajectory surface hopping   algorithms for electronically nonadiabatic chemical reactions by testing   them against converged quantum dynamical results to be produced by his   new linear algebraic variational methods; 2) To pinpoint the specific   features of trajectory surface hopping methods that are most responsible   for any observed inaccuracies and to use this knowledge to focus future   efforts to improve the methods; 3) To develop a   transition-state-theory-like approximation for overall quenching rate   constants; 4) To better understand the physical effects that determine   branching ratios for decomposition of exciplexes through funnels; 5) To   incorporate quantum mechanical effects into practical variational   transition state theory calculations; 6) To further develop the   stabilization method as a practical tool for multi-dimensional   resonances; 7) To exploit parallel computers for efficient quantum   mechanical calculations on four-body systems; and 8) To use the accurate   quantum dynamical calculations on hydrogen fluoride dimer as a means of   improving the potential energy surface for this system.  Truhlar's research is aimed at a basic molecular level understanding of   chemical dynamics and solvation. This research has important strategic   implications in areas of atmospheric and environmental chemistry.",
