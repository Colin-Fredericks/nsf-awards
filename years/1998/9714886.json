 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of the Chemistry Division, Chronister will combine high-pressure diamond   anvil techniques and ultrafast nonlinear coherent spectroscopic methods   as a high-resolution probe of molecular solids.  Infrared and visible   photon echo experiments will be conducted on mixed molecular solids and   amorphous glasses in order to elucidate the dynamical processes taking   place in condensed phases.  The proposed experiments will examine   electronic and vibronic dynamics in inhomogeneously broadened solids as a   function of temperature and density and will be used to refine theories   of optical and vibrational dephasing in amorphous and mixed crystalline   solids.    High pressure applied to materials provides a way of altering the   interactions between molecules in a solid in a continuously controlled   manner.  This allows for the systematic study of the attractive and   repulsive forces that exist on an atomic level.  Chronister will measure   the behavior of solids under high pressure and low temperature   conditions.  The information gathered is difficult to obtain because the   pressures involved are extremely high and temperatures are very low.    However, these data will ultimately aid our understanding of the dynamic   interactions between species in solid solution and their host materials.    The sorts of studies undertaken here also reveal much about the behavior   of materials under extreme conditions.",
