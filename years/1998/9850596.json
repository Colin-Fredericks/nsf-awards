 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new computer-based classroom is being established to support continued curricular developments in the undergraduate biochemical, materials, and analytical chemistry areas of the department, and to provide additional support for computer-based instruction in our introductory physical chemistry course.  Novel features of the developments include the use of actual experimental data from advanced research instruments in laboratory and classroom experiences that are designed to (1) provide appreciation of the roles of protein crystallography and NMR spectroscopy in the determination of biological structures, (2) allow students to perform homework in physical chemistry classes that is based on solving realistic problems, (3) support further development of the uses of simulations and data processing to provide more trenchant presentations of concepts in physical chemistry, and (4) provide the means to present more effectively essential concepts in solid state chemistry. Students impacted by this project include those majoring in chemistry, biology, and engineering; we estimate that about 400 advanced undergraduates in a dozen formal courses will be affected yearly by the project. Instructional materials developed will be freely distributed by means of the WWW. While intended to be used exclusively for the support of instruction at the advanced undergraduate level, the facilities of the classroom are being made available to undergraduate research students and to various K-12 outreach efforts operated by other units of the campus when the classroom is not being used for these purposes.",
