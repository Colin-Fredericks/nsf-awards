This system represents a fundamental upgrade of the high-speed imaging capabilities of the Photomechanics Laboratory and would support research and development in engineering and sciences.  The new high-speed imaging system would be utilized to investigate various high loading rate and stress wave dominated physical phenomenon.  \r\n\r\nThe advanced capabilities of the new high speed imaging system will be utilized to investigate catastrophic decohesion of ceramic-metal interfaces subjected to dynamic loading.  Real time experiments will be conducted using interferometry based optical techniques such as Coherent Gradient Sensing.  Moir\u00da and Twyman-Green interferometry to investigate various aspects of the fracture of ceramic/metal bimaterial interfaces.  Dynamic loading would be achieved either by projectile impact in a one point bend configuration or by detonation of explosive.\r\n\r\n",
