 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800247\t\r\nSerpen\r\nThe well-known difficulty with a wide array of static optimization\r\nproblems is that their search spaces become too large to search for\r\nan optimal solution within reasonable time and computational\r\nresource bounds once the size of these static optimization problems\r\nincreases to real-life dimensions.  Algorithms implemented on\r\nconventional computing systems lack the computational power to\r\nsearch for an optimal solution of a large set of real-life size static\r\noptimization problems in a time efficient manner since they are not\r\nable to utilize the inherent parallelism that may exist.  Artificial\r\nNeural Networks offer key advantages over conventional computing\r\nsystems as optimization problem solvers: they can take advantage of\r\nthe inherent parallelism of the optimization problem and offer very\r\nfast computation cycles for a hardware realization of the neural\r\nnetwork algorithm.  These advantages make Artificial Neural\r\nNetworks a very attractive choice for addressing the static\r\noptimization problems of real-life complexity.   At the present time,\r\nthe scaleability properties of current Artificial Neural Network\r\nalgorithms employed for static optimization are far from the\r\ndesired state, which establishes the motivation for the proposed\r\nresearch project.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to address and solve the scaling problem\r\nwhich Artificial Neural Network algorithms currently experience for\r\nstatic optimization problems.  Towards that goal, computational\r\npromise of the Simultaneous Recurrent Network, a trainable and\r\nrecurrent Artificial Neural Network algorithm, for static\r\noptimization problems will be explored and assessed.  Existing\r\nneural optimizer algorithms are either trainable feedforward\r\narchitectures or recurrent architectures with preprogrammed\r\nweight structures.  This proposed research project will use a neural\r\nalgorithm which is both a recurrent architecture and trainable will\r\nbe employed to address the difficulties related to the scaling\r\nproblem.  It is hoped that recurrency and learning will form a very\r\npotent combination to address the challenging problem of scaling.\r\n",
