 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 97-27724  ZUFALL      An important feature of the nervous system is its ability to  receive complex signals and translate some of them into meaningful  information, a process that is called information processing.  Information processing is not a static process but is highly  adaptive; this provides the basis for organisms to change in  response to certain stimuli, or -in other words- to learn.  Perhaps most critical for this process are proteins termed \"ion  channels\" because they have a pore in the middle that allows  certain ions to pass back and forth between inside and outside of  the cell.  In this project, Dr. Zufall will analyze the properties  of a novel class of ion channels and determine their role in  neuronal information processing.  These ion channels are termed  \"cyclic nucleotide-gated\" (CNG) cation channels because they can  be activated by the ubiquitous intracellular messenger molecules  cAMP and cGMP (\"cations\" are positively charged ions).  An  important property of these channels is that they allow for the  entry of Ca2+ into nerve cells which itself acts as an important  messenger molecule in neuronal signaling. The general approach  being used is to use cultured neurons (neurons grown in a dish)  from a specific brain area (the \"olfactory bulb\") which is  critical for the sense of smell, and to probe these neurons with  specific markers for CNG channels.  The next step will be to apply  electrophysiological recording methods and to measure ionic  currents through activated CNG channels.  This will allow for the  characterization of functional properties of CNG channels and  determination of their specific roles in neuronal signal transfer.  A second goal is to use a microscope capable of detecting Ca2+  fluxes through activated CNG channels. Results from this project  will establish the existence and properties of this novel family  of ion channels in neurons of the central nervous system and  determine their precise role in information processing.",
