The project aims to develop  a cross-cutting methodology for seismic risk assessment and  management of urban transportation infrastructure systems through  U.S./Japan research collaboration.  The approach integrates  engineering, systems analysis and economics.  Three related tasks  will be carried out: (1) Development of performance criteria and  design of mitigation strategies, (2) modeling transportation and  economic system response in earthquake disasters, and (3) economic  evaluation of mitigation strategies.  In Task 1, the U.S. role will  consist of developing performance criteria based on transportation  accessibility measures, working with Japanese counterparts on  alternative criteria based, for example, on reliability  engineering, and designing associated retrofit and repair  strategies for evaluation in the transportation-economic model.   Research in Task 2 will focus on improving and expanding upon the  L.A. Highways model.  This effort will emphasize modeling of  earthquake damage repair and associated bottlenecks using  experience data from Kobe in order to evaluate the benefits of  faster network recovery.  Modeling expertise will be shared with  the Japanese team as they build similar models for Japan.  In Task  3, U.S. and Japanese researchers will collaborate on evaluating the  benefits and costs of retrofit and repair strategies, and assessing  the economic implications of the performance criteria identified in  Task 1.    This is a joint project carried out by investigators at the  University of Washington and the University of Southern California.  ***",
