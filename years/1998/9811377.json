 "awd_abstract_narration": "9811377  Swager    This Selected Grant for Exploratory Research project will focus  on the synthesis and investigation of liquid crystals with  unusual forms of chirality and shape.  The use of chiral  sidechains and molecular shape will be examined to create systems  that have two opposing organizational preferences.  This  competition will provide frustration, and it is expected that  these materials will produce interesting situations and give rise  to novel phases and properties.  In other systems, the  interactions between the chirality and the molecular shape may be  comparative.  Illustrations of the types of phases include polar  lamellar structures with NLO properties, biaxial nematics for  display applications, and chiral columnar phases.  The columnar  phases should display different degrees of chirality with the  application of electric fields, which may be used to produce  electro-optical modulators.  %%%  The response of liquid crystals to electric fields is at the  heart of all Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs).  This work seeks to  generate new types of liquid crystals with extended organizations  that have a chiral or handed sense.  These new liquid crystal  materials will produce a rotation of plane polarized light that  is expected to be altered upon their interaction with an electric  field.  New phases introduced by competing and opposing  interactions are also envisioned.  These new phases as well as  the interaction of the materials with electric fields have the  potential to produce a new class of optical switching materials.  ***",
