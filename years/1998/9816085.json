 "awd_abstract_narration": "9816085  Strong    The Bimathematics Instruction Framework is a staff development program which provides a set of tools (organizing principles) to help teachers reorganize instruction at their grade levels and vertically among grades within the school in a focused coherent manner.  A bimathematics Scope and Sequence serves as a guide for planning the instructional program around the organizing principles.  The Organizing Principles are:  (1) Some Key foundation Principles of Mathematics; (2) proportional Reasoning and Multiplicative Relationships; (3) Patterns, Functions, and Relations.  The Bimathematics Organizers are used to reorganize, compact, and condense the myriad of mathematics objectives in a typical mathematics curriculum into an effective, doable instructional program.  Instruction is addressed from a bimathematics point of view.  Bimathematics instruction is firmly rooted in the philosophy of the NCTM Standards and the findings and implications of the TIMMS Study.    Teachers are prepared to implement the program through 30 hours of instenisve training in the Bimathematics Framework.  Objectives addressed in the training are:  (1) mastery of the key organizers, (2) relating the bimathematics scope and sequence to instructional needs, (3) preparing to use the organizers in mathematics programs for the following year, (4) developing implementation plans, and (5) forming school support teams.  Trained teacher-mentors provide classroom assistance throughout the year.  These teacher-mentors assure that teachers actively implement what they have learned.",
