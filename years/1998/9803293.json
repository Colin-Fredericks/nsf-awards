This may also lead to\r\nresults about the topology of 3-manifolds admitting appropriately restricted\r\n(essential or tight) versions of these (partial) plane fields on the\r\n3-manifolds.   Another goal is to establish further connections between\r\ncontact structures and foliations and laminations in 3-manifolds.  Finally,\r\nOertel will continue to study automorphisms of 3-manifolds, refining and\r\ngeneralizing existing work that deals with the important case of\r\nautomorphisms of handlebodies and compression bodies.  The goal here,\r\nalready partially achieved, is to classify automorphisms of 3-manifolds\r\nup to isotopy, as in the Nielsen-Thurston classification of automorphisms\r\nof surfaces.\r\n     A closed 3-manifold is a space that is locally like ordinary\r\n3-dimensional space.  Thus, understanding 3-manifolds amounts to\r\nunderstanding all possible 3-dimensional universes.  Especially since\r\nhumans live in a 3-dimensional space, one wishes to determine properties\r\nof 3-manifolds, and ultimately, also to classify them.  From the 1950's\r\nto the 1970's, progress on 3-manifolds was based to a large degree on\r\nmethods using certain embedded surfaces, called incompressible surfaces.\r\nFrom the 3-manifolds containing incompressible surfaces, one can, for\r\nexample, extract algebraic information sufficient to distinguish any two\r\nof them.  The investigator will use objects in 3-manifolds similar to\r\nincompressible surfaces, namely essential laminations and essential maps\r\nof surfaces, to explore the unknown territory further.  There are other\r\nstructures on 3-manifolds, called contact structures, that have their\r\norigins in geometry rather than topology.  Work of Eliashberg and Thurston\r\nhas shown that contact structures are related, via confoliations, to\r\ncertain laminations called foliations.  With Swiatkowski, the investigator\r\nis finding further connections among an entire range of related objects:\r\ncontact structures, confoliations, foliations, laminations, and\r\ncontaminations, the last being a newly invented object.  It is typical in\r\nmathematics to study a space by studying suitable maps from the space to\r\nitself.  For 3-manifolds, one can consider maps called automorphisms or\r\nself-diffeomorphisms.  In continuing research, Oertel is classifying\r\nautomorphisms of 3-manifolds (up to isotopy).  The work is revealing a\r\nrich and interesting theory of the automorphisms of some of the simplest\r\n3-manifolds.\r\n***\r\n",
