 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9761044  Brower    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of measuring strain in real time on bridge structures by investigating a method to monitor the mechanical response of the bridges components using fiber-optic sensors.  The effect of forces exerted on major civil engineering structures during normal usage and natural catastrophes such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, or severe storms could be measured.  These sensors will be designed to be rugged, low-cost, and will provide monitoring of strain in real time -- allowing a constant vigilance of the state-of stress, the safety, state of repair, and expected life-time of the structure.  The ultimate goal of this research effort, is to commercialize a fully developed Fiber-Optic sensor that can be used throughout the construction industry.  The commercial sensor systems will contain \"proven\" low-cost optical fibers, hardware, software, memory, display, and support equipment.  This will be achieved through research, and application of an approach, that uses innovative ideas built on existing fiber-optic interferometeric sensors.  If successful, it will be possible to accurately measure the mechanical response properties of bridges and other civil engineering structures in any desired location.  Strain from long-term and transient loads can be measured and recorded.    Currently, large civil engineering structures are visually inspected.  Extensometers or mechanical measuring devices are used on a periodic basis to evaluate the state of the structure.    Unfortunately, visual inspections usually occur after a structural problem has already manifest itself.  Presently, there is a significant need for sensing devices that Provide constant monitoring of the state of the structure.  The sensors could be used in civil engineering structures that use concrete, steel, composites and other construction material.  Bridges, buildings, parking garages, highway overpasses are ex amples.    ***",
