 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of high speed data acquisition and digital signal processing (DSP) technology has become the cornerstone of many areas of electrical engineering. This is particularly true in the fields of communications, controls, intelligent systems, signal and image processing. One of the driving forces behind DSP is the overwhelming interest in real-time processing as, for example, in high definition television, spread spectrum communications, and speech recognition systems. It is clear that DSP is instrumental in conveying the principles of many topics covered in electrical engineering particularly with respect to modeling and simulation. The objective of this proposal is to develop a multi-course sequence which employs DSP at many levels of the undergraduate curriculum for the purpose of enabling students to visualize, test, and implement concepts introduced in the classroom. This will be accomplished through the completion of special projects and laboratory exercises in multiple courses with the goal of developing a solid foundation in engineering principles by the time of graduation. All students will be required to take a core set of courses which introduce DSP concepts, including applications where DSP is not typically employed. The level of complexity will be increased as students progress through the curriculum, culminating in technical electives that will extend their knowledge in a particular area of interest. The objectives of the sequence will be realized through the employment of current as well as proposed equipment. This project is part of a plan to blend state-of-the-art technology with real world applications for the purpose of enhancing the undergraduate experience.",
