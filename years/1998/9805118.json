The principal investigator is Dr. Lawrence Tavlarides of Syracuse University. The research will lead to a class of organo-ceramic adsorbents to selectively extract specific metals. This is an engineering approach to the development of selective adsorbents by combining developments in two fairly disparate areas. Organic chelating agents  are functionalized with an inorganic unit so that they can participate in sol gel reactions and thereby become incorporated into a porous ceramic structure. The materials are classified as type III polycerms. These materials are novel  in that they incorporate specific chemical functionality  and thus impart selectivity to the organo-ceramic matrix.\r\n\r\nThe research has the potential to significantly impact technologies relating to the sequestration and recovery of toxic and/or high value metals. The sequestration of toxic metals is of extreme importance in pollution prevention and control. And the recovery of platinum based metals from spent catalysts is also very important to the petroleum refining and chemicals processing industries. \r\n\r\n",
