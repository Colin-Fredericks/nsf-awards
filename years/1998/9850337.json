 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to industry need, this project develops and delivers a rigorous and transferable curriculum for an Associate Degree in Computers and Information Technology. This program serves as a school-to-work model for community colleges, meets the needs of students seeking entry level jobs and IT professionals seeking to upgrade their technical skills, and provides the necessary foundation for students who decide to transfer to four year institutions. In particular, the project develops and validates certification standards for entry level positions in high-performance companies.    IT representatives are selected from industry, academia and the public sector to identify the needed skill sets, soft skills are incorporated into the curriculum, internship experiences are made available to students, and certification of skill acquisition are to be based upon industry standards. The new curriculum is delivered via technology mediated learning (interactive CD and the Internet).    The target audiences for this project include students in high schools, community colleges and universities, particularly Latino students. It also includes IT workers retraining for jobs in emerging high-tech fields and faculty at high schools and community colleges. This project is a collaborative that includes Evergreen Valley College, East Side Union High School District, Foothill/DeAnza Community College District, San Jose State University, Workforce Silicon Valley, Sun Microsystems, Oracle Corporation, CBT Systems, and  Waite Group Press.",
