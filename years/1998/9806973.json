This proposal is a Workshop  on, \"Materials Design and Processing at the nano- and Mesocales Through Self-Assembly' held at the national Science Foundation, January 13 and 14, 1998.  The overall aim of the workshop is to discuss opportunities, means and barriers to bringing self-assembly processing of materials from their current state of laboratory innovation into the real technology and manufacturing realm.  A group of more than 35 expert scientists and engineers, including 6 from industry and 4 from national laboratories, have agreed to participate in this Workshop.  Th format will be a series of four plenary lectures followed by intense discussion in four topical groups.    * Designing Nanostructured materials Through Molecular and Subunit Architecture    * Characterization Methods and Process Control for Self-Assembly of Nanostructured Materials     * Product Possibilities from Self-Assembly    * Processing Routes to Self-Assembly, Nanostructured Materials    The report of this workshop will be a working document for the National Science Foundation staff to provide guidance for future funding intiatives in this area.",
