 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804316\r\nStewart\r\n\r\nRigid body dynamics with impact and friction is a subject which is of vital \r\nimportance for many applications (robotics, manufacturing, biodynamics, \r\nvirtual reality) yet there has been curiously little development of the \r\nunderlying theory both for computation and analysis. The principal \r\ndifficulties arise due to impulsive forces (giving discontinuous velocity \r\nfunctions) and the discontinuities due to Coulomb's friction law. Notable \r\ndevelopments in the theory of rigid body dynamics can be found in the \r\nwork of J.-J. Moreau and M.D.P. Monteiro-Marques, who use\r\ntime-stepping methods for discretization and measure differential \r\ninclusions for the continuous-time problem.  These methods are notable in \r\nthat they directly incorporate the effects of discontinuities and impacts \r\ndirectly, without needing to handle them separately from other effects.  \r\nTaking their work as a starting point, this project will advance the theory \r\nand practice of rigid body dynamics by developing new complementarity \r\nformulations of time-stepping methods, extending the theory of measure \r\ndifferential inclusions for the continuous-time problem, and providing new \r\nconvergence results based on weak* convergence of measures.\r\n\r\nEveryday life is full of examples of impact and friction. Walking, for \r\ninstance, involves impact at every step, and friction to prevent from \r\nslipping.  Yet what people do naturally, is very difficult for a machine to \r\ndo.  It is difficult even to simulate walking, or even to simulate machines \r\nthat try to walk. Manufacturing processes involve many parts coming into \r\ncontact, touching and sliding, yet simulating these basic processes has not \r\nbeen done well.  There are several reasons for this: the computational \r\nmodels of these processes have been inadequate, and there has been little \r\nor no theoretical basis for evaluating the computational models.  The \r\npurpose of this grant is to improve both the computational models and to \r\ndevelop the theoretical basis for rigid body dynamics.  The result of this \r\nwill be better simulation software, able to properly simulate the dynamics \r\nof robots, manufacturing machinery, and (perhaps) the way people walk.  \r\nThis software will become vital manufacturing infrastructure for the 21st \r\ncentury.\r\n",
