 "awd_abstract_narration": "EcoSim is a set of stand-alone software modules for  Windows 95 personal computers that will satisfy the needs of  biologists for null models.  \"Null models\" are simulations  that deliberately exclude a mechanism of interest, and  provide benchmark tests for patterns in nature.  Initial  funding from an NSF SGER grant resulted in the development  of a graphical user interface and the prototypes for two  modules of EcoSim.  This project will expand EcoSim and  develop nine software modules to answer broad questions in  community ecology.  Each module will contain a number of  simulations and statistical tests that are most appropriate  for addressing the question.  The modules will test patterns  of (1) species diversity, (2) niche overlap, (3) body size  ratios, (4) co-occurrence, (5) incidence functions, (6)  species-area relationships, (7) range overlap, (8) shared  species, and (9) cluster formation.  A tenth module will  allow the user to construct customized null model tests with  a minimum of programming.  This tenth user-module will  greatly expand the utility of EcoSim for problems in  population genetics, demography, and behavior.       EcoSim is written in Delphi, a high-level programming  environment for Object Pascal.  Data can be easily imported  and exported, provided full compatibility with other  graphics and statistics software.  Pull-down menus,  checkboxes, and a powerful data editor allow users to select  a variety of simulation options.  Output is fully documented  and can be exported to text files.  An extensive online Help  system, which includes a tutorial and sample data sets,  guides users through the steps of null model analysis.  The  expanded EcoSim will be demonstrated in seminars,  presentations, and workshops.  As with the current version  of the program, the expanded EcoSim will be distributed free  via the Internet.",
