 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major deficiency in many undergraduate science courses is the lack of inquiry-based laboratory exercises. Students typically are inundated with vast quantities of information and learn how to carry out specific techniques in the laboratory, but learn very little about the process of science. Historically, molecular biology has received little attention in the Biology Department curriculum at UCA. To improve this situation, a molecular biology teaching program will be implemented as opposed to a stand alone molecular biology course. In doing so, molecular biology will be integrated into our curriculum in such a way that experiences in advanced courses will build upon concepts and techniques learned in previous courses. Biology majors, health science majors, and pre-service biology teachers will perform inquiry-based molecular biology experiments in two lower division courses. The exercises are designed to facilitate learning of fundamental concepts and investigative techniques such as pipetting and elecerophoresis in the freshman course that lead directly into a simple cloning and plasmid mapping project to be performed in the sophomore level genetics course. Biology majors will build upon these experiences in a senior level Experimental Molecular Biology course with a laboratory designed as a semester-long, discovery-based gene cloning project. Pre-service biology teachers will use concepts and techniques that they have learned to develop \"take home\" molecular biology laboratory exercises to be used in their secondary level classrooms. An emphasis will be placed on hypothesis formulation, independent learning, and analytical thinking at all levels. Acquired equipment will also be used by students conducting undergraduate research projects. The proposed project will allow students seeking a variety of careers to experience the excitement of observation and discovery. Descriptions and evaluation of these curriculum innovations will be disseminated through publication in educational journals, d evelopment of a laboratory manual, and posting on the World Wide Web.",
