 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9733981  Sun    This career development project in textile chemistry and science involves both development of innovative surface modification technologies for functional textile materials and clothing and incorporation of research activities into textile chemistry education. The surface modification processes will be able to impart durable and regenerable chemical and physical properties to existing textile materials, which include durable and regenerable antimicrobial and pesticide protective functions. These materials can be used as medical protective clothing that can inactivate pathogens and prevent possible cross contamination, and as chemical protective clothing that can effectively detoxify chemicals on the surface of the fabrics. Furthermore, the materials are reusable, durable, and comfortable, which will replace currently used impermeable and disposable or thick and heavy materials, and significantly reduce heat stress to wearers, especially to those who work in harsh environments.  The innovative processes and technologies studied and developed in the research will be included in an undergraduate course of textile coloration and finishing and in a new graduate course on functional textile materials. It is anticipated that textile courses filled with up-to-date technologies and theories will motivate more talented students to major in textile science and strengthen the only textile program in the University of California system.",
