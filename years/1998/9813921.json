The award will enable the winner(s) to develop and disseminate undergraduate engineering curriculum materials based on knowledge and experience gained through the competition.  Funds provided through this transfer will also be used for the general administration of the FCC, including materials and supplies for the teams and public outreach and dissemination of results.  The FCC is a competition for student teams (primarily undergraduates) to design and build a mid-size, production-ready vehicle achieving the goals of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV).  PNGV is collaboration between seven federal agencies and the U.S. Council for Automotive Research (USCAR), a consortium that includes General Motors, Ford Motor Company, and Chrysler.  The FCC is sponsored by DOE and USCAR.",
