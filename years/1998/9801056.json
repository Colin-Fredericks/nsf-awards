 "awd_abstract_narration": "9801056 PATTON  Rats and mice of the subfamily Sigmodontinae comprise the largest group of living mammals in South America, with some 250 species occupying all habitats throughout the continent. One of the subgroups of this diverse assemblage is the Oryzomyini, a group (\"tribe\") of about 15 genera and 100 species that occur from the grasslands of the high Andes to the Amazon rainforest.  Many of these have highly localized ranges and are of conservation concern; others are widespread and have been implicated as vectors in human diseases.  Little is certain about the historical (phylogenetic) relationships among rodents in this tribe; it is thought that they are descended from North American migrants.  Resolving these relationships is a complex problem that presents a significant scientific challenge.  A robust reconstruction would provide a historical framework for informed management decisions for those species of conservation concern (such as those endemic to the Galapagos Islands) as well as for those implicated as vectors in major human diseases (such as hanta virus).  In this doctoral dissertation research, James L. Patton and student Luis F. Garcia will reconstruct the phylogeny of the Oryzomyini, principally by comparing DNA sequences from several genes in the mitochondrion and nucleus. The \"combined gene\" approach should provide high resolution of the phylogeny at all taxonomic levels within the tribe.  The phylogeny should allow the researchers to test some prevailing ideas about when and where these rodents first became established in South America, and how they diversified after their introduction.",
