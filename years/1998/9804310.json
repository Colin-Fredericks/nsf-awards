 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804310  Drucker    This project addresses self-assembly of heteroepitaxial  semiconductor coherent island quantum dots. The approach is to  study atomistic mechanisms of self-assembly in the Ge/Si(100)  system; since, although Ge/Si(100) is the simplest system for  which self-assembly has been observed, it retains much of the  self-assembly related behavior observed in more complex alloy  semiconductor systems such as SiGe/Si, InGaAs/GaAs. A variety of  in and ex situ microscopies (scanning tunneling, atomic force and  scanning and transmission electron microscopies) will be employed  to characterize ensembles of self-assembled quantum dots (SAQD)  formed using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and chemical vapor  deposition (CVD). The phase-space of experimentally accessible  parameters; substrate temperature, deposition rate, total  coverage and postgrowth annealing, will be systematically  investigated in order to identify pathways to obtaining desired  size and shape uniformity throughout the ensemble of SAQD. A  primary goal is to obtain this uniformity while retaining the  flexibility for varying the mean radius of the dot size  distribution and the areal density of the dots from sample to  sample. The observed morphology of the Ge/Si(100) SAQD will be  correlated with their optical properties using photoluminescence  spectroscopy. The experimental investigations will be  complemented by further development of a model of microstructural  evolution in strained island systems. This model incorporates the  elastic energy of coherent islands and a diffusion bias away from  strained islands which increases with island size. Further  insight into the self-assembly process will be gained through  kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of strained island growth.  %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high technological relevance. The  research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a  fundamental level to important aspects of electroni c/photonic  devices.  Experimental tools are now available to allow atomic  level observation of elementary processes which when better  understood will allow advances in both fundamental science and  technology. The basic knowledge and understanding gained from the  research is expected to contribute to improving the performance  and stability of advanced devices and circuits by providing a  fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing  improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important  feature of the program is the integration of research and  education through the training of students in a fundamentally and  technologically significant area.  ***",
