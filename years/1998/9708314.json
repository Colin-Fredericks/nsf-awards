Lake-effect weather  events, where cold air masses are rapidly modified over the Great Lakes, are  excellent natural laboratories for studying these exchanges. The Lake-Induced  Convection Experiment (Lake-ICE) is a multiple-Principal Investigator project which  seeks to use this natural laboratory to determine how boundary layer growth  processes are controlled by mesoscale boundary layer convective structures and how  the modified boundary layer effects the production of precipitation and the larger  scale meteorological conditions.         Under this award the Principal Investigator proposes to investigate how the  convective planetary boundary layer organizes in response to the evolving  environmental flow structure.  The researcher will utilize a suite of advanced  numerical models along with observations to be collected during the Lake-ICE.  The  ultimate objective is to bridge the gap in understanding of the large eddies in the dry  convective planetary layer that occurs on the upwind side of the Great Lakes to that  of the linear cloud rolls on the lee side.          If successful, this research will lead to a unified theory of linear cloud roll  genesis and the interaction of the factors responsible for that genesis with the  larger-scale environmental flows.  This could lead eventually to better forecasts of  timing, location and magnitude of lake-effect snow events.      ***",
