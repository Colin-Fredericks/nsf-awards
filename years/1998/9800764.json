 "awd_abstract_narration": "This investigation allows the conduct of a national survey of voter characteristics during Thai parliamentary elections scheduled for May, 1998.  The elections have been called with very limited lead time and, to date, no studies such as this exist at the national level.  The timely announcement of scheduled elections represents a rare opportunity to examine voter attitudes in the context of a Thai election.  These elections will be the first held under a new constitution, adopted September 27, 1997.  This constitution makes significant changes in the system of elections and in the structures of representation in the Thai parliament.  Thus, the proposed study will establish a baseline of attitudes toward democracy that will be highly important for future scholarship, as well as providing a benchmark for retrospective studies of the previous electoral system.  The survey is conducted with the collaboration of four Thai universities, using a sampling framework developed by the principal investigator in an earlier study.  Questions are designed to measure levels of political interest, political knowledge, political efficacy, and political culture.  The study focuses on attitudes toward democratic institutions and rights under the new constitution as a basis for evaluating the status of Thai democracy.  The dataset to be gathered should be of value to other scholars interested in the topic.",
