Michelsohn\r\n\r\nThis multi-part project is concerned with the study of cycles and\r\nresidues in geometry.  One part concerns the groups of algebraic\r\ncycles and cocycles on a projective variety X and aims to relate these\r\ngroups to the global structure of X.  A theory of homology type for\r\nalgebraic varieties based on homotopy groups of cycle spaces has been\r\ndeveloped, and will be used to study concrete questions about\r\nalgebraic spaces.  A second part of the proposal concerns cycles in\r\nprojective space, which have surprizing connections to fundamental\r\nconstructions in algebraic topology.  Some of the resulting questions\r\nconcern spaces of real and quaternionic cycles related to\r\ncharacteristic classes and representation theory.  Others concern\r\ncycles under the action of a finite group.  Here the spaces have led\r\nto new equivariant cohomology theories whose development and\r\napplication will be explored.  A third area of investigation concerns\r\nsingular connections and characteristic currents, a generalization of\r\nclassical Chern-Weil theory which relate singularities of mappings to\r\ncharacteristic forms in a canonical analytic way; applications and\r\ndevelopments of the theory include a new approach to Morse Theory.  A\r\nfourth area concerns calibrated cycles in geometry: special Lagrangian\r\ncycles in Calabi-Yau manifolds, cycles related to existence of\r\np-Kaehler spaces, and cycles appearing in M-brane theory.  This\r\nproject is also concerned with graduate student development,\r\nespecially interaction at the research level among graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis project concerns questions of global structure in geometry and\r\nhas several interrelated parts.  The first aims at furthering our\r\nunderstanding of the spaces which arise as solutions of systems of\r\nalgebraic equations (so called ``algebraic cycles'').  These spaces\r\nhave a long history and play a central role in many areas of\r\nmathematics, applied mathematics and physics.  Breakthroughs over the\r\npast ten years have given fresh insights into the subject and a richly\r\nstructured theory has emerged.  The proposed research will forge new\r\nlinks between algebra and geometry/topology, and lead towards settling\r\nsome important conjectures in the field.  Another area of\r\ninvestigation is concerned with relations between cycles and geometry\r\nwhich arise from connections.  Connections are fundamental in\r\nmathematics, where they constitute differentiation laws, and in\r\nphysics, where they represent the fundamental forces of nature at the\r\nclassical level.  The investigators have developed a theory of\r\nsingular connections which encompasses many previously unrelated\r\nphenomena and has applications to several areas of geometry.  This\r\nproject will continue this work with emphasis on applications.  In\r\nstudying the least area problem one of the investigators developed a\r\ntheory of calibrated cycles which currently plays an important role in\r\nphysical theories.  This new relationship has raised some important\r\nquestions and conjectures that will be studied.\r\n",
