 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806308  Adenwalla  This research project will investigate the size, shape and  spacing dependence of regular arrays of micron sized magnetic  features, multilayer features, and measure the coupling between  them. The magnetization of these arrays will be studied using  conventional magnetic measurements which will give information  about the overall bulk magnetization properties, and will also  include in-situ Magneto-optical Kerr Effect (MOKE) measurements  which provide information during sample growth as well as  information about the magnetic correlations between features.  With a high resolution MOKE set up it will be possible to study  the magnetization feature by feature. Greater understanding of  magnetic properties of these arrays and by extension the effects  of size, shape and spacing on magnetic properties in general is  anticipated.  %%%  This is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional  Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE)  program. The research will contribute new materials science  knowledge at a fundamental level.",
