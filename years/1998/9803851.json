 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803851  DeGuire    In the last several years, several techniques have been described  in the literature for depositing ceramic thin films from aqueous  solutions at low temperatures (<100 C) on various solid  substrates.  Work by the PI has focused on the bioinspired use of  organic self assembled monolayers (SAMs), on substrates such as  single-crystal silicon and glass, as a means of inducing and  controlling the formation of oxide films on the substrate.  The  objective of this GOALI project is to obtain a detailed  understanding of the mechanism by which films form from aqueous  solutions, on substrates with and without SAMs.  In particular,  the relative importance of heterogeneous nucleation of solid on  the substrate, versus assembly of colloidal particles on the  substrate, will be assessed in a variety of film-forming systems  of technological interest.  The project is subdivided into  several areas:  1) Studies of the thermodynamics and kinetics of  the formation of ceramic particles from the aqueous source  solutions.  The research tools to be applied include  thermodynamic calculations of the degree of supersaturation of  the solutions, in combination with small-angle x-ray scattering  measurements of the deposition media to monitor the formation and  growth of particles as a function of time;  2) Studies of the  interactions between ceramic particles and the substrate  surfaces, and the influences of those interactions on the films'  microstructures.  DLVO theory will be used to estimate the forces  between ceramic particles and the substrates.  The calculations  will be compared to direct measurement of these forces using the  atomic force microscope (AFM).  The AFM will also be used to  observe film growth, from its earliest stages in situ, to ex-situ  observations of the films' surface topographies;  3)  Experiments  combining this fundamental understanding with some of the unique  capabilities of SAMs to optimize growth rates and/or film  microstructures for specific applicatio ns.  %%%  Thin film deposition from aqueous solution are potential  alternatives to vapor-phase and chemical-precursor techniques.  The low processing temperature minimize problems related to  substrate-film interdiffusion and thermal expansion mismatch.  However, the degree of control of the microstructure and thus the  properties of the materials processed from aqueous solutions is  not as great as from vapor-phase techniques.  This project  addresses that issue by the use of SAMS.  The industrial  collaborator in this GOALI project is Caterpillar Technical  Center.  The collaboration includes personnel exchange (CWRU  people working at Caterpillar, the industrial scientist working  at CWRU), tests being performed on equipment at Caterpillar, as  well as the industrial scientist serving as a co-advisor to the  graduate students.  In addition to Caterpillar, the  Max-Planck-Institut fur Metallforschung in Stuttgart, Germany and  Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee are  participating in this project.  Each collaboration brings  facilities and expertise that are integral to the proposed  research, and offers a variety of working environments that will  expand the educational value of the research experience for the  student researchers involved with the project.  This project is  co-funded by the Ceramics Program of the Division of Materials  Research and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities of the  Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.  ***",
