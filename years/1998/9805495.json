Shanno  Interior Point Methods for Nonconvex Nonlinear Programming      Abstract:      The research is concerned with studying logarithmic barrier methods for  nonconvex nonlinear programming. The problem studied is the problem of  minimizing a nonlinear objective function subject to nonlinear inequality  constraints. Topics to be studied include merit functions, trust regions,  and matrix modification methods for nonconvex problems. A topic of extensive  study will be higher order methods for solving the nonlinear system of  equations arising from the first order conditions for the problem, with  particular emphasis on extending Mehrotra's predictor-corrector method to  nonconvex problems. The general nonlinear programming problem, which has  equality contraints, bounds and ranges as well as inequality constraints   will be adapted so as to be solvable with the algorithms developed. Careful  study will be made of the problem of determining infeasiblility and   unboundedness for nonconvex nonlinear programs. Special algorithms will be  developed for problems where second derivatives are not available. All   developed algorithms will be coded and extensively tested.         Nonlinear programming problems arise in a wide variety of applications  drawn from a broad spectrum of engineering and science problems, statistics  problems, economics problems, and logistics problems to name a few of the   many areas where such problems are common. For example, drawing inference from  data bases is a statistics problem that often requires the minimization  of a nonlinear likelihood function subject to parametric constraints. This  problem becomes particularly difficult when the dtabase is very large. The  proposed research will develop methods for these nonlinear problems that are  akin to the interior point methods that have proved so efficient for very  large scale linear problems. These methods are also highly applicable to  solving nonlinear partial differential equations with n onlinear boundary  conditions, which are used in everything from aircraft design to design  of structures such as bridges to estimating the reserves in an underground  groundwater or oil reserve, as a few examples of the myriad applications. Part  of the project will be to collect as broad a problem set of real applications  as possible to adapt the algorithms to be efficient for these problems, and  to demonstrate the use of the algoritms across the widest possible spectrum  of applications. In all cases, the the algorithms will be designed to   solve very large problems efficiently, as these methods are proving extremely  efficient for large problems on high performance computers.",
