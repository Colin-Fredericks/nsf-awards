Namely, if G/H is a non-compact, simply connected homogeneous space \r\nof a connected Lie group G, the question is whether there is a properly \r\ndiscontinuous subgroup D of G such that the orbit space D\\G/H is compact. \r\nSome special cases have been studied by L. Auslander, Y. Benoist, G. A. \r\nMargulis, R. J. Zimmer, H. Oh, and others.  If there is a compact subset C of G with CHC = G, then we say that H is a Cartan-decomposition subgroup, and it is easy to see that G/H does not have a tessellation.  The project will use Cartan-decomposition subgroups as a starting point in a study of tessellations of homogeneous spaces of semisimple groups of real rank two.  The other main focus of this project is generalizing the PI's theorem that arithmetic groups of Q-rank at least two have no interesting continuous actions on connected one-manifolds.  (In algebraic terms, the theorem asserts that no central extension of any such arithmetic group is right orderable.)  The PI conjectured that the \r\nassumption on Q-rank can be replaced by the same assumption on the real \r\nrank, and this leads to interesting questions about the algebraic structure \r\nof arithmetic groups.\r\n     \r\nMany important materials are crystals.  The atomic structure of such a \r\nmaterial is very symmetric, and a first step toward understanding the \r\nphysical properties of the material is to study the group formed by all the \r\nsymmetries of the structure.  This project investigates the symmetry groups \r\nthat arise from crystals in mathematical spaces other than the \r\n3-dimensional universe we live in.  A basic problem addressed by this \r\nproject is to understand which spaces do contain crystals.  Also, this \r\nproject will study the structure of the symmetry group of the crystals that \r\ndo exist.  For example, the PI and others have shown, in many cases, that \r\ncrystals in two different spaces cannot have the same group of symmetries. \r\nHowever, it is often still not known whether the group of symmetries can be \r\nthe same as the symmetries of a one-dimensional non-rigid (and, hence, \r\nnon-crystalline) structure.\r\n",
