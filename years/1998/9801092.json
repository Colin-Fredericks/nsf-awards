 "awd_abstract_narration": "9801092  Allan    Heterotrophic bacteria play an important role in the cycling of carbon and nutrients in aquatic ecosystems.  In tropical freshwaters, however, it is unclear how bacterial activity is regulated.  Because temperatures are consistently high in tropical systems, the influence of carbon and nutrient availability, rather than temperature, is expected to be particularly strong.  In addition, in tropical rivers, large seasonal variations in rainfall strongly influence the amount of carbon and nutrient inputs from land, which should in turn influence bacterial activity. The PI's have preliminary data for one year showing that bacterial production is very low in lowland rivers of the Orinoco basin, and these data suggest seasonal variation related to hydrology. In this dissertation research the PI's will investigate the following questions: (1) What is controlling bacterial production in lowland rivers of the Orinoco basin? and (2) Are there patterns in bacterial production associated with hydrologic seasonality? To answer these questions the PIs will conduct substrate addition and pH amendment experiments to determine the factors limiting bacterial growth, and measure bacterial production at different points in the annual flow cycles in two black and two clearwater rivers of the Middle Orinoco basin. The proposed research will determine how bacteria are regulated in tropical lowland rivers and will increase knowledge about the function of relatively undisturbed rivers in the neotropics before they are affected by development.",
