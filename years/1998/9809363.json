The MRSEC is supporting the introduction of  \"peer instruction\" in area public schools and supports a nationally advertised Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program.  The Center supports well maintained shared experimental facilities which are accessible to outside users and also supports interactive efforts with industry and other sectors.  \r\n\r\nOne of the three interdisciplinary research groups is investigating artificially structured materials and electronic microsystems.  This group supports work on atomic surface transport, nanowires, soft lithography, and atom lithography.  The goal of some of this work is the fabrication of small structures without the use of visible light projection and patterning.  A second group is exploring the interfaces between synthetic and biological systems with opportunities in sensors, biocompatible devices, and tools for molecular and cell biology research.  The third group investigates thermo-mechanical properties at small length scales of diverse systems such as carbon nanotubes, multi-layer metal-semiconductor assemblies, and novel microsystems made with soft lithography.  \r\n\r\nParticipants in the Center currently include 22 senior investigators, 8 postdoctoral associates, 21 graduate students, 14 undergraduates, and 10 technicians and other support personnel.   Professor Robert M. Westervelt directs the MRSEC. \r\n",
