 "awd_abstract_narration": "A datacube is a multidimensional structure that contains at each point an aggregate value, i.e., the result of applying an aggregate function to an dataset of records. The purpose of this project is to develop, implement and experimentally evaluate techniques to reduce the storage needs in a multidimensional cube by substituting some of the data by more succinct models that characterize it. By doing this, errors are introduced when the data is reconstructed. The tradeoffs between space savings and reconstruction errors are studied, along with tradeoffs between response time to queries and reconstruction errors. Understanding these tradeoffs makes it possible to efficiently design and implement multiresolution systems where query answers can be incrementally refined as the user looks at them. Finally, the models are a good starting point to mine the cube data since they show valuable patterns and associations among the different dimensions. The results of this project will provide valuable techniques and software to efficiently store and analyze large multidimensional data sets, such as those that are common in health, financial and scientific applications.     http://www.isse.gmu.edu/~dbarbara/quasi.html",
