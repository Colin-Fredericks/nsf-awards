Performance levels are expressed in terms of allowable  damage to structural and non-structural components, with the  intention of providing definite margins of safety.  Three  performance levels are considered, including Immediate  Occupancy, Life Safety, and Collapse Prevention.  Although  the guidelines represent a significant advance in the  practice of seismic engineering, calibration of the analysis  procedures and acceptance criteria for actual building  performance is clearly needed.  The objectives of this CAREER Development Program are to:  (a) Evaluate and compare the design of various lateral force  resisting structural systems according to the proposed 1997  NEHRP Recommend Provisions for Seismic Regulations for New  Buildings & Other Structures; (b) Evaluate and compare their  performance-based response during various levels of seismic  excitation using nonlinear time history dynamic analyses;  and (c) enhance an existing graduate course in Civil  Engineering at Texas A&M and develop a short-course for  students, researchers, and practicing engineers from the  United States and Mexico which will emphasize performance-  based design of seismic force resisting structural systems.  The impact of the project will be recognized by providing  probabilities of occurrence for various performance levels  of several types of structural systems due to earthquakes of  varying intensities.  Therefore, given performance based-  design objectives for a structural systems during  earthquakes  of varying intensities, the lateral load  resisting mechanism can be selected for optimal performance.  In addition, given an existing structural system designed  according to previous building codes, the ex pected  performance level under various earthquake intensities can  be identified and the need for seismic retrofit can be  determined.",
