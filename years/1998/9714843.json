The proposed work falls into two  distinct areas, (1) vibrational energy transfer and (2) shock  waves in materials.  Simple liquids, such as acetonitrile and  water, and solids such as naphthalene which are of current  theoretical interest will be studied.  Shock waves will be used  to study shock-induced chemical reactions in simple model  systems, and shock-induced material transformations and  relaxation processes in complex systems such as glasses and  proteins.  Shock methods with greater time resolution using  surface sensitive spectroscopies will be developed.  Studies of  laser photothermal imaging materials will be extended to a  variety of imaging materials with different architectures to  develop a general understanding of the fundamentals of laser  photothermal imaging processing.  %%%  An understanding of ultrafast dynamics and shock wave induced  chemistry in condensed matter systems that include liquids and  solutions, polymeric solids and proteins play an important role  in a number of materials areas such as biomedical applications,  and photothermal laser-imaging materials for graphic arts  applications.  ***",
