 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806999\r\nLewis\r\nThe long-term goal of this proposed research is to develop strategies for the design of biomimetic major ampullate silk by uncovering the structure-function relationships of naturally ocurring spider silk proteins and their materials properties.  This will be accomplished through two major objectives.  First, the nucleotide and amino acid sequence variation in major ampullate silk genes among divergent spider species will be characterized.  The second objective is to study the structure of the proteins in the solid fiber to understand what provides the elastic and strength properties.  These data will provide the basis for construction of second generation spider silk biomaterials with properties designed into them.\r\n\r\nNatural materials have been a part of our culture for centuries but only in the past few years has the study of these materials reached the molecular level.  This deeper understanding of biological materials has led to the new field of biomimetics.  One of the materials which has generated considerable interest is spider silk.  Spider silk fibers possess a numbrr of unique properties when compared to other natural or manmade fibers.  Almost all the applied research on spider silk has focused on major ampullate silk and its military and industrial potential.  This material has a tensile strength in excess of 300,000 psi and an extension approaching 35%.  This two factors make it one of the toughest materials ever tested.  These unique properties suggest promising applications in fibers, films and composite materials.  There is no question that the development of spider silk as a biomaterial will have a substantial impact on society.  These new materials would provide a number of new products as well as improvements on current ones.  These products will be fibers, films and composites with spider silk as the key component.  The investigators have taken some of the necessary steps but the information generated by this proposal will substantially enhance the ability to produce major ampullate silk as a biometerial as well as be the basis for developing synthetic silk analogs with designed mechanical properties.",
