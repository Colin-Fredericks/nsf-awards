Stephen; Guimaraes, Mario; Jeffress, Gary; Michaud, Patrick; Patterson, Holly; Sadovski, Alex; Stafford, Max  CISE MII: CISE Minority Institutions Infrastructure Program-- FY 98  Restructuring and Enhancing an Applied Computer Science Program \r\nThis award supports the planning and development of a comprehensive blueprint for expanding the current research activities and curriculum of Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi.  This blueprint will enable the department to recruit more students, particularly minority students, into both undergraduate and graduate programs, retain more undergraduates, and increase the research capacity.  As part of this process, the PIs expect to develop cooperative agreements with other regional universities to pipeline their master's students into other Ph.D. programs.  Activities include:  identifying areas of applied research which can have a significant impact (e.g., GIS applications, mathematical modeling and simulation, and fundamental enabling technologies for interactive systems including HCI, distributed systems, hypermedia and development environments); identifying equipment needed to support an expanded research program; traveling to other universities to discuss the Ph.D. pipeline community; developing a plan for disseminating the results for project; pursuing other sources for acquiring research equipment; and identifying linkages between courses and additional research activities.",
