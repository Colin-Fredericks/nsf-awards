 "awd_abstract_narration": "Berg is supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to study   fundamental problems in liquid and glass dynamics using a combined   experimental/theoretical approach.  The broad viscosity range available   in supercooled liquids will be utilized for exploring the origin and   temporal development of dynamical features within the 50 femtosecond to   25 nanosecond window accessible to ultrafast laser methods.  Femtosecond   techniques and related theory will be employed for studies that include   probes of intertial and diffusive dynamics, the development of dynamic   inhomogeneity near the liquid-glass transition, and whether liquid   dynamics can be described in terms of `modes.`  An essential feature of   this project is the comparison of different dynamical measurements within   the same system.  The outcomes from this research are expected to   contribute understanding useful in developing a comprehensive molecular   theory of the collective dynamics of liquids and glasses.  Many technologically important processes are influenced by the dynamics   of simple liquids or other disordered materials. For example, materials   such as polymers, inorganic glasses, and biological materials are used or   processed in a fully or partially fluid state.  New insights into the   nature of supercooled liquids and the liquid-glass transition that will   result from this project could impact materials design and processing   technologies.",
