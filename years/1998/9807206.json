 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology student at the University of Colorado will study how local systems of traditional ecological knowledge in Fiji are affected by external factors, and how this process impacts fragile marine ecosystems. Exogenous economic and political forces from national and international sources often influence local systems of resource management. These forces will be examined within the context of the variability in the management of marine resources by chiefly elites or traditional fishing rights owners within a community based marine reserve now being established in Fiji. The student will compare variability of resource management activities and of traditional ecological knowledge between three inshore fishing villages, each with a different set of development constraints.  Hypotheses to be tested will deal with conflict between land developers, dive tourists, and local and non-local small-scale commercial fishing enterprises, all competing over traditional fishing right zones.  As external pressure increases the student hypothesizes increased conflict over local chiefs over access to the economic benefits from leasing the traditional zones. The student hypothesizes that traditional knowledge systems will erode as the influence of external commercial fishing, tourism and development increases (the alternative hypothesis is that the knowledge will develop through being defended and explained to outsiders). The project will also assess the potential for ecological damage from the diverse uses of the underwater resources.  The research is important because it will advance our understanding of how traditional societies can conserve natural resources which are valued by a wide range of interests.",
