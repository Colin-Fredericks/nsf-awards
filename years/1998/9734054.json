 "awd_abstract_narration": "9734054  Isaacs   With the increasing importance of commercialization and liabilities of materials, attributes other than technical performance are becoming significant for characterizing the success and performance of materials: the manufacturing cost and the environmental consequences of using the material. The objectives of this interdisciplinary research project are to develop modeling tools that (1) aid in assessing the commercial potential and process economics of existing and developmental technologies, and (2) identify environmental life cycle effects. Working with industrial partners, the initial phase of the research concentrates on development of process-based technical cost models in the powder metallurgy industry, simulation of manufacturing costs and development of environmental metrics. Analyses will be performed to identify economic and technical parameters that are necessary for successful implementation of advanced materials. In later phases of the project, analyses will be extended to more advanced powder processing of materials, such as magnetic, ceramic and composite materials.  Results from this work are expected to provide critical information about performance, economic and environmental tradeoffs that influence the implementation and competitive positions of alternative manufacturing technologies. Students working on this collaborative project will synthesize a relevant, meaningful manufacturing experience by participation in the graduate cooperative education program with the industrial partners. Research results will also be used to develop case-based interactive courses that raise the environmental literacy of undergraduate and graduate engineering students.   The ultimate goal of this research plan is to develop a sustainable and balanced effort among interdisciplinary education, case-based research and industrial co-op experience. The nature of this research encourages technology transfer, strengthens the knowledge-base of all participants in the partnership, and im pacts societal needs by aiding in assessment of economically viable, environmentally beneficial solutions to technological problems.",
