 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to enable the Davidson College Biology Department to implement its new mission and vision statements (see appendix V) and to unify the cell and molecular curriculum. Students will use phase contrast microscopes to make quantitative measurements, design experiments with appropriate controls, interpret and communicate their results. This \"hands-on\" approach will extend to non-majors laboratory courses (a graduation requirement for all students) as well. Furthermore, students will conduct independent research with the microscopes and image analysis equipment allowing them a more realistic experience to learn the unknown by conducting experiments. The unification of the curriculum is based upon using isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) as a model enzyme in all cell and molecular laboratory courses. This unification will enable students to see how different approaches to a common protein can extract different kinds of information. For example, where and when is IDH expressed in a developing embryo? To answer this question, students will use phase contrast microscopy and image analysis to measure the expression of IDH as determined by the formation of a colored product. This will be integrated with experiments in introductory biology, genetics, and biochemistry so students can see the synergy between disciplines that students often think of as separate and unrelated--\"seeing is believing.\" In addition, the unifying concept has initiated several collaborations among faculty to develop new investigatory labs. The immediate impact will be on students who take these courses and begin to see biology as a continuum of knowledge that is interrelated. The long-term impact will be on other biology departments which can use our innovations to unify their curricula too. The ultimate outcome will be a population of students who learn by doing experiments that are exciting and informative and which reveal an understanding of biology that is larger than can be provided by individual c ourses",
