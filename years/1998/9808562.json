 "awd_abstract_narration": "Davidson\r\nPyrimidines are essential to normal cellular metabolism, proliferation and viability and to normal animal development. The research to be conducted is focused on the first three steps in the de novo synthesis of pyrimidines (i.e. the enzymes carbamyl phosphate synthetase [CPSase], aspartate transcarbamylase [ATCase], and dihydroorotase [DHOase]). In mammals, these three enzymes are found in a single translation product of ~240,000 daltons called CAD. Three specific aims will be pursued. The first is to learn how the carboxyl end of the DHOase domain contributes to enzymatic function when it is so different from its counterpart in E. coli. Specific site-directed substitutions made in the hamster DHOase will be analyzed for enzymatic kinetics both when the DHOase is expressed as a monoenzymatic protein and as a domain in CAD. The second aim is to identify those residues in the allosteric domain of the CPSase that bind the negative effector, UTP, and the positive effector, PRPP. CAD carrying substitutions in the allosteric domain will be assayed in vitro for activity in the presence or absence of UTP and PRPP and will be introduced into Drosophila in order to see how alterations in allosteric regulation affect fly development and pyrimidine levels. The third aim is to examine the pattern of regulated CAD expression in mouse embryos and in adult mouse organs. Tissue slices will be hybridized with 35S-labeled CAD antisense RNA to reveal those cells expressing CAD RNA and by inference the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. The  results of this research will provide new data on the structure and function of an essential multienzymatic protein, on the importance of regulating the first step in a biosynthetic pathway and on when and where CAD is expressed in animal tissues.\r\n\r\n",
