 "awd_abstract_narration": "The last two decades have seen a resurgence in the interest of  investigating various neural models of computation.  Researchers  from various fields such as mathematics, computer science,  cognitive science and biology are either trying to analyze the  capabilities and limitations of various neural models, or  proposing extensions or modifications of current neural models to  make these models more consistent with applications in biology,  control theory, pattern recognition and other related areas.  Recent advanced mathematical techniques using results on semi-  algebraic sets, model theory, statistical methods and theory of  real numbers have enabled researchers to answer many theoretical  questions about neural models which were previously open. This  project continues further investigation of the capabilities and  limitations of various neural models, either from a theoretical  point of view using some of the advanced mathematical techniques  mentioned in the references, or from an experimental  point of  view.  The ultimate objective is to be able to provide further  insight into the working mechanisms of these models, and to  modify or extend existing models whenever appropriate.  The  theoretical investigations to be carried out in this project will  also be valuable in various practical application of neural  models.  This project involves interaction with undergraduate  students which should prepare them for possible graduate studies  in mathematics, computer science and theoretical biology.",
