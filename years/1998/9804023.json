Two  topics  to  be  studied  are (a) shot noise of the supercurrent in quantum  point  contacts,  and  (b)  tunneling-controlled  transistor  action  in  Josephson  heterostructures. Topic  (a)  addresses  the  ultimate  limits   of  noise in point contacts, and interest as  structures  are  reduced in size; topic (b) opens the possibility for  highly  sensitive   superconducting  devices.   The   research   furthers  knowledge   on   issues   of  compatibility   in   semiconductor-  superconductor  lithographically patterned devices.  This  highly  interdisciplinary  research  will involve  graduate  student  and  postdoctoral  researchers  who will  receive  excellent  training  beneficial  to  their future careers in industry,  government  or  academia.  %%%  This interdisciplinary experimental research project is concerned  with unusual electron junction devices, which in some ways  resemble the transistors which are present in computer chips and  many other semiconductor electronic devices.The devices of  interest here are unusual in that they combine semiconductor  device methods with superconducting elements, and in some cases  they may be termed \"superconducting transistors\" . A  superconductor has the property that it passes an electrical  current without generating any heat. One of the problems with  present day semiconductor electronics is that the heat generated  is so great as to require fans and even air conditioners to take  it away. Hypothetical superconducting computer chips would avoid  this problem, and for this reason could be made smaller with  larger numbers of devices per chip. The research in the  experimental project explores two types of devices which combine  semiconducting and superconducting elements. The res ults of this  study will add to basic understanding which could be of future  benefit in microelectronics technology and in the production of  improved sensors for magnetic field, electrical current, and  related quantities. The research also furthers knowledge on  issues of compatibility in semiconductor-superconductor  lithographically patterned devices. This highly interdisciplinary  research will involve graduate student and postdoctoral  researchers who will receive excellent training beneficial to  their future careers in industry, government or academia.  ***",
