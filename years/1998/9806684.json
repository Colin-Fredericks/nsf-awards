 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806684  Hudson    A number of new synthetic liquid crystalline materials that form  spherical or cylindrical nanostructures (supramolecular  assemblies) that are similar to certain biological materials will  be investigated.  Thermotropic materials are selected for this  study, because of benefits that include experimental ease snd  inherent application to harsh environments (temperature or  vacuum), electronic and multifuntional ccomposite materials.  The  potential for electronic application of these materials is clear:  the organic photoconductors with the most rapid charge transport  operate on the principles of columnar assembly and liquid  crystalline alignment.    Order-order transitions (e.g. from columnar to spheroidal) have  been identified and will be studied by diffraction and electron  microscopy.  These can be induced either by a temperature  changeor by polymerization.  Investigation of these transitions  will provide significant understanding of thestructure and  stability of each phase.  Homologous series of molecules are  being provided through several collaborations with the PI, so  that the influence of molecular architecture on supramolecular  shape and packing will be determined.  The similarities and  differences between long and short chain molocuhs will be  elucidated.  Such knowledge will be useful input for the  development of theoretical concepts concerning the phase behavior  of small amphiphiles.    Further insight into these materials will be gained through the  study of their order-disorder transitions.  Using rheological ant  optical analysis, this project will investigate the isotropic-to-  columnar phase transition and the existence of pretransitional  fluctuations that would indicate the presence of columns within  the disordered state.  The contol of this ordering transition is  crucial for applicafions in which the device performance depends  on column orientation.  Surface anchoring and flow alignment of  these materials will be explored.    This project w fll provide the instruction and training of a  graduate student.  This project will also benefit a self directed  portion of a laboratory course (at the graduate and undergraduate  level).  %%%  Functional nanostructures in Nature (used for information  storage, selective transport of chemicals and energy, and  mechanical strength and toughness) inspire synthetic materials  development.  This project will investigatc the structure and  ordering processes of synthetic solvent-free liquid crystalline  nanostructures that are more suited to application in demanding  environments (such as high temperature or vacuum),  photoelectronic and multifunctional composite materials.  This  work will proceed in parallel with synthetic efforts in other  labs so that principles of molecular design can be determined.  ***",
