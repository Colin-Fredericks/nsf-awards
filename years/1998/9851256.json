 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Physics and Astronomy is upgrading the experimental physics experiences for upper level undergraduate physics majors. This project specifically involves the acquisition of equipment for improving an upper level laboratory courses taken by physics majors. This two semester course is entitled Experimental Physics I & II. Laboratory space is being renovated for teaching this course. Specific objectives of the modernization are as follows: (1) To learn experimental techniques and the use of modern instruments employed in physics research laboratories, (2) to develop an understanding of standard techniques of data reduction and error analysis commonly used by physicists; (3) to develop computer techniques that are useful for the acquisition and analysis of large quantities of data; (4) to learn proper techniques that are useful for designing experimental research projects; (5) to learn proper methods for presentation of scientific results; and (6) to independently design, conduct, analyze and present selected experiments in physics and (7) to experience the experimental basis of physics. It is expected that this modernization at Howard University will help similar steps at other HBCUs also.  This project concentrates on E-M radiation, its interactions and uses. The experiments are, (a) Dielectric constant measurement at microwave frequencies, (ii) Hologram construction, (iii) Faraday effect, (iv) Optical spectroscopy, and (v) Compton effect.",
