 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves undergraduate students in experiments using modern methods of analysis of biomolecules. In particular, a series of integrated experiments are being developed that assess the activity of proteins known to bind genomic DNA at specific sequences. These proteins are critical for regulating the information flow from DNA to RNA and on to polypeptides. Equipment enables students to spend more time thinking about the experimental results and analyzing the data.  An example of this is the determination of protein concentrations in fractions following chromatographic separations via gel exclusion chromatographic matrices, hydrophobic interaction matrices, and affinity matrices.  A method for non-radioactive, non-enzymatic detection of the activity of sequence specific DNA binding proteins is being developed that can readily be used in undergraduate teaching laboratories. A family member of the group of proteins related to the Myb oncogene binds telomeric DNA sequences specifically, and a recombinant DNA molecule are being constructed that will also allow expression, purification and analysis of its DNA binding activities. This course is geared to helping students experience first-hand the excitement of scientific inquiries and to relate their experiments with current investigations in basic biochemical and biomedical research.",
