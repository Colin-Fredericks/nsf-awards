 "awd_abstract_narration": "9808656  LALLIER   The formation of  the vertebrate central  nervous system is characterized by two major cellular processes:  1) the instruction of the ectoderm to differentiate into nerve  cells (neural induction), and 2) the movement of this ectoderm  from the surface of the embryo into the interior (neurulation).  While much is understood about the cellular mechanism underlying  the first, little is known about the second.  Dr. Lallier will  investigate how the cells of the future brain and spinal cord move  inside of the embryo using the frog Xenopus laevis as his model  system.  Dr. Lallier has previously demonstrated that a cell-  surface molecule called alpha-6 integrin is necessary for  neurulation.  Alpha-6 integrin helps anchor presumptive neural  ectoderm to its extracellular environment; specifically, to the  axon stimulating molecule laminin.  The present studies are aimed  at discovering whether this molecule is required for neural  induction or neurulation.  Preliminary data suggest that the alpha-  6 integrin is not required for the induction of a series of genes  expressed specifically during the early phases of neural  induction.  Therefore an in depth study of the role of  alpha-6  integrin in the cellular and mechanical events of neurulation are  planned.  These results will enable researchers to better  understand this essential early developmental event in the  formation of the nervous system.",
