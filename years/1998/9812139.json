 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9812139  Chiang  This proposal presents an architecture for on-line DSA and seeks to develop a dynamic contingency screening scheme based on the direct method to make on-line DSA feasible for current or near future power system operating environments.  In particular, this proposal will develop BCU classifiers to satisfy the following essential requirements for on-line DSA:    (1) (reliability measure) absolute capture of unstable contingencies; i.e. no unstable (single-swing or multi-swing) contingencies are missed.  In other words, the ratio of the captured unstable contingencies to the actual critical contingencies is 1.    (2) (efficiency measure) high yield of screening out stable contingencies, i.e. the ratio of the stable contingencies detected to the actual stable contingency cases is as close to 1 as possible.    (3) (on-line computation) little need of off-line computations and/or adjustments in order to meet with the constantly changing and uncertain operating conditions.    (4) (speed measure) high speed, i.e. fast classification for each contingency case.    (5) (performance measure) robust performance with respect to changes in power system operating conditions.    To meet the five essential requirements, we propose to first perform the following tasks: (1) to conduct some theoretical study for development of numerical indices, (2) to construct improved numerical energy functions, (3) to develop a more reliable numerical implementation of the BCU method, (4) to develop numerical indices for detecting the occasional, invalid numerical energy functions, and (5) to develop numerical indices to detect the occasional controlling u.e.p. convergence problem.  Then, the results of these tasks will be integrated into the preliminary version of BCU classifiers to form an improved version of BCU classifiers which will satisfy the five requirements for performing on-line dynamic contingency screening.  The success of this proposed project has a direct impact on making the task of performing  on-line DSA feasible for current or near-future power system operating environments.",
