During the past two decades, remarkable progress  has been made toward a global understanding of stable homotopy theory, showing  that some major features arise chromatically from an interplay of periodic  phenomena arranged in a hierarchy.  This project is part of an effort to  develop a similar understanding in unstable homotopy theory.  The investigator  has introduced a hierarchy of localizations called periodizations, which serve  to resolve a given space into a chromatic tower with monochromatic fibers.  He  will work to understand these periodizations as well as the closely related  localizations with respect to Morava K-theories.  He recently discovered  surprising new functors between the stable and unstable monochromatic layers  of homotopy theory.  Using these functors and other tools, he will explore the  structure of the monochromatic layers.  At the classical K-theoretic level,  this work is leading to solutions of old problems concerning periodic homotopy  groups and the K-theory of spaces.       Topological or geometric spaces arise, for instance, as sets of solutions  to systems of equations, and they play a central role in mathematics.  Beyond  their usual measurements, such spaces have deeper properties that persist even  after drastic deformations.  These properties begin very simply with the  number of separate components and the number of \"holes\" in a low dimensional  space but become tremendously rich and informative in higher dimensions.  The  field of homotopy theory is devoted to their study, using powerful algebraic  and geometric techniques.  In recent years, an exciting chromatic approach  to the subject has emerged, allowing decompositions of complicated homotopical  phenomena into much simpler periodic parts.  However, this chromatic approach  was originally rest ricted to certain stable phenomena.  In the present  project, the investigator is working to extend it to a full range of unstable  homotopy theoretic phenomena.  ***",
