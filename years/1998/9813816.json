There are several objectives to this program, including a continuation of the tradition established by a previous series of very successful symposia on Turbulent Shear Flows (TSF) which began in 1977 and ran every other year through the 11 th meeting in 1997.  The TSF series focused on turbulence fundamentals, turbulence modeling and applications of models to industrial flows, direct and large eddy simulations with applications, building block flows such as wakes and mixing layers, particle-laden flows, and compressible and variable density flows. The Santa Barbara symposium is the will continue to emphasize these objectives.  It is also intended to significantly broaden the scope of the new TSFP symposia series to reflect the increasing range of technological applications and environmental processes in which turbulence and shear flow phenomena play a key role.  These areas would include the fluid mechanics of multiphase systems, biological and biomedical systems, environmental fluid mechanics, and flow control and MEMS.",
