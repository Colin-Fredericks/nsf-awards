 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research on the mathematical theory of chaotic dynamical systems is proposed. More specifically, this project focuses on the geometric and statistical theories of dynamical systems with predominantly hyperbolic behavior.  A systematic study of the rates of mixing and related statistical properties (such as the Central Limit Theorem) for chaotic systems continues work of an earlier NSF-supported project. Three other areas of investigation are proposed: stability under small random perturbations; strange attractors of a certain solenoidal type and possible applications; and the use of dynamical systems techniques in two problems from mathematical physics, the one-dimensional Schroedinger operator and the fast dynamo problem in magneto-hydrodynamics.  Physical phenomena, such as weather and atmospheric disturbances, evolve with time. Dynamical Systems is the branch of mathematics that studies the theories that lie behind the time evolutions of these and other processes. Researchers in this field analyze models proposed by physical scientists, form theoretical bases for explaining observed phenomena, and aim ultimately to predict future occurrences. One of the advances in the nonlinear sciences in this century is the recognition that relatively simple physical laws can and do have extremely complicated manifestations. Behaviors that appear to follow no logical patterns are often grouped under the term \"chaos.\"  Chaotic systems are the objects of this research. In this project, various avenues will be pursued to relate the outward chaotic manifestations of a dynamical system to its underlying order, taking into account random fluctuations that occur as a result of chance.",
