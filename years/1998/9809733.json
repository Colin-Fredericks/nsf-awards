Since the first FOCAPO conference in 1987 and second one in 1993, there has been an enormous increase in interest in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of process operations.  Since much of the restructuring within the process industry over the past few years has been operations focused, and given the likely continuation of this trend and the host of related research and technical issues, FOCAPO 98 will bring together practitioners, management, and researchers for a comprehensive look at the state of the art in computer aided process operations, a discussion of strategies important to thriving in an environment of continuos change and rapidly advancing technology, and the important challenges to be overcome.    The program will concentrate on the following themes:    o Advances in the Integration of Process Subsystems  o Advances in Quantitative and Qualitative Methodologies for Process Operations, Analysis, and Engineering  o Advances in Interaction of Tools and Environments for Process Operations  o Integration of Operations Goals Including Economic, Quality, and Environmental Concerns  o Advanced Computing and Networking for Process Operations  o Human Factors in Deploying Advanced Technology",
