 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9760633  Thomas    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop a hand-held environmental Monitor, which employs a four-component microsensor array of chemiresitors, for initial Site characterization of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  This solid-state device is designed to generate characteristic response patterns that arise from key analytes and mixtures from fuels, cleaning solvents, and aromatic hydrocarbons.  The VOCs are identified and quantified by analyzing the unique response produced by the microsensor array using a pattern recognition algorithm integrated with the environmental monitor.  For example, conducting particles dispersed within polymer films provide a basis to detect trace concentrations of organic vapors by measuring resistance changes that occur to these materials as they swell.  Previous research studies have demonstrated that it is possible to correctly identify and quantify a model group of VOCs using chemiresistor arrays manufactured with these types of materials.  This technology has the following advantages: (1) integratable into small, inexpensive systems, (2) high sensitivity and reliability to detect VOCs, (3) low power requirements, and (4) immunity to shock and vibration.  Successful completion of this project will significantly impact the use of gas microsensors for environmental applications by developing a low-cost system to reliably identify and quantify the presence of VOCs.    The proposed hand-held analytical instrument, which employs a microsensor array of chemiresistors, provides a basis to monitor the presence of gas-phase analytes and mixtures from fuels, cleaning solvents, and aromatic hydrocarbons.  These low-cost systems are designed for environmental applications to reliably detect potentially hazardous environments.  ***",
