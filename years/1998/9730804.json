 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730804  Clements      The State University of New York at Buffalo plans to develop exemplary PreK-grade 2 curriculum materials, which will enable young children to build solid content knowledge and to enhance their higher-order thinking skills.  The approach is that of \"finding the mathematics in,\" and \"developing mathematics from, children's activities.\"  Activities will be designed based on children's experiences and interests, with an emphasis on supporting the development of mathematical growth.    The materials will emphasize the development of basic mathematical building blocks - organized into two areas:  (a) spatial and geometric competencies and concepts and (b) numeric and quantitative concepts.  There will be three mathematics sub-themes, patterns and functions, data, and discrete mathematics.  The materials will be progressively layered so that users will be able to \"dig deeper\" into them in order to reach increasingly rich, but demanding, pedagogical and mathematical levels.      The \"Building Blocks\" will be developed for a wide variety of situations according to a research-based design model.  These materials will support and complement the new NCTM PreK-2 Curriculum and Evaluation Standards.  This project has the potential to develop pedagogically efficacious materials that will serve as tools of content and pedagogical reform, to conduct formative and summative evaluations at multiple levels, and to have a positive effect on learning of young children from a variety of settings.",
