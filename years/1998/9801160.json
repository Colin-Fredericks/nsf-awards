 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9801160  Ebert  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II proposal from Ebert and Associates, Inc. seeks to develop a means of providing efficiently and accurately recorded, managed, analyzed, and visualized rock art data within a unified 3-dimensional database, accommodating a wide range of scales and resolutions for use by rock art researchers, conservators, managers, and other data users.  Phase I research indicated that the rock art profession and market needs an integrated system for rock art data recording, management, and analysis incorporating in-field 3-dimensional laser and contact digitizing, digital and conventional photography and the use of global positioning systems for data collection, digital photogrammetry and surface modeling for data reduction, CAD and geographic information systems technologies for data input and database management, and a number of other digital technologies for data analysis and display.  Phase II research objectives focus on the development of methods by which data collection, reduction, management, analysis and display technologies will be integrated into a coherent whole.  Appropriate rock art data recording, reduction, management and analysis/visualization subsystems components and integrative software and methods for their use together will be specified, and a prototype general total rock art system will be developed and assembled.  This hardware/software system will be tested in a number of different rock art situations.  The project has value for scientific research and education and for the preservation, conservation and management of cultural heritages.  Rock art researchers, archaeologists, anthropologists, conservators, cultural resource managers, and Native American groups--in the United States and worldwide--will benefit from the development of such a system.  In addition, there are other situations that share the problems inherent in the capture of rock art images to which a modified system could be applied, such as in the catalog uing of geologic formations and the cataloguing, management, and analysis of 3-D data at polluted sites.  ***",
