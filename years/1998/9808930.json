Synapses in the brain may increase in  strength, or decrease in strength, as a consequence of learning  by  an animal. One prominent form of a change in synaptic strength that  occurs  in  the mammalian brain is known as homosynaptic  long-term  depression or LTD. LTD is a decrease in the strength of a  synapse,  lasting  60 minutes to hours, produced by low-frequency stimulation  of  a  presynaptic neural pathway. Many synapses in a part  of  the  brain known as the hippocampus exhibit LTD. Because the hippocampus  plays  an important role in learning and memory in mammals,  it  is  thought  that  LTD  might represent a neural mechanism  of  memory.  Despite  a half-decade of work on LTD in the hippocampus,  however,  relatively little is understood about the cellular mechanisms  that  underlie  LTD. Furthermore, even less is understood regarding  what  role LTD of hippocampal synapses might play in learning and memory.  Part  of  the  difficulty  is that the  hippocampus  is  a  complex  structure.  Moreover,  the  types  of  learning  that  involve  the  hippocampus are difficult to understand on a neurobiological level.  The  goal  of the present project is to study the role  of  LTD  in  learning and memory in an animal with a simple nervous system.  The  hope   is  that  the  insights  gained  by  studying  the  cellular  mechanisms of LTD, and its role in learning, in a relatively simple  organism  will  help us to understand the mechanisms and  learning-  related  role  of  LTD  in  the brains of more  complex  organisms,  including  man.  Toward  this end the  PI  will  study  LTD  in  an  invertebrate  organism, the marine snail Aplysia californica.  This  animal  possesses a relatively simple nervous system  and  exhibits  several  simple  forms of learning. Furthermore, a  great  deal  is   already  known  about the neural mechanisms of Aplysia's  behavior.  The PI has previously shown that synapses between sensory and motor  neurons  in the nervous system of Aplysia can exhibit LTD.  The  PI  will analyze the cellular mechanisms of LTD of the synapses between  sensory  and  motor neurons in Aplysia. The PI will also  determine  whether LTD plays a role in a simple form of learning exhibited  by  Aplysia known as long-term habituation. The results of this project  should  provide important general insights regarding  the  cellular  mechanisms  of LTD and the role that LTD plays in learning.  It  is  expected  that  these  insights will advance  knowledge  about  how  nervous systems mediate learning and memory.",
