 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support the development of a magnetic  tweezers apparatus to measure local viscoelastic and  structural properties of the cell cytoplasm and the  extracellular matrix.  The magnetic tweezers produce a  magnetic field of known magnitude and direction.  The field  exerts a magnetic force on spherical magnetic particles with  definite geometric and magnetic properties, which are  injected into the cytoplasm or matrix.  The motion of the  magnetic particle is monitored using optical methods.  The  trajectory of the particle is recorded on a computer.  Simultaneously, the motion of the particle is also described  in terms of standard models.  The local viscoelastic  parameters of the cytoplasm or matrix are obtained from the  matching of the model trajectory and the experimentally  obtained trajectory.  The knowledge of these parameters  provides information on the local structure of  interconnected networks of biological macromolecules that  exist in the cytoplasm (i.e. cytoskeleton) and the  extracellular matrix.  The magnetic tweezers will also be  used to study intracellular stress propagation.  At present  the magnetic tweezers are the only apparatus that allows the  measurement of local viscoelastic properties of biological  systems in a non-destructive way.  By combining several  magnetic tweezers, effects similar to those produced by  optical tweezers could be generated.  The laser traps in the  latter case are analogous to magnetic traps in the former  case.  At the same time, the costs associated with the  development and operation of a magnetic tweezers are  significantly lower.",
