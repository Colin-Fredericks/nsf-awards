 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the use of precisely defined templates for   the production of organic oligomers of precise molecular weight and   constitution.  Rigid-rod oligomer templates will be used for the rapid   construction of oligomers having the same length as the templates.    Monomers will be attached to the templates via covalent bonds, then   oligomerization will be chemically induced to afford a supramolecular   parent-daughter duplex.  Cleavage of the parent-daughter duplex would   produce a daughter oligomer that retains the specific length information   of the parent template.  Methods are proposed to  reuse the parent   template and the daughter as a new template, thus making the entire   process catalytic in template, and ultimately similar to the polymerase   chain reaction (PCR) in its productive capabilities.  The project could   significantly simplify the preparation of precisely defined   macromolecular architectures which are currently prepared only by   laborious step-wise procedures or multiple analytical separations.  With   this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is   supporting the research of Dr. James M. Tour of the Department of   Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of South Carolina.    Professor Tour will focus his work on developing new routes for the   facile construction of organic oligomers  of precise molecular weight and   constitution.  These precise macromolecular systems are becoming   important for electronics, photonics, molecular electronics, catalysis,   separation science, nano-engineering, and nano-bioengineering",
