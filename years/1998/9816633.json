 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the design of highly mobile wireless  systems where not only end-users are mobile, but also the base  stations that serve these end-users are mobile. The mobility of  base stations introduces several challenging problems in the  design and development of such systems. In this project, highly  mobile wireless architectures with capability for intelligent  survivability and adaptive connectivity in an unpredictable  environments will be researched. Contributions will be made to the  foundation of intelligent highly mobile wireless network and  computing systems design, including network architecture, digital  information storage, intelligent distributed adaptive  reconfiguration, network routing, location management,  channel allocation, and information security. Intelligent agents  capable of taking autonomous decisions under uncertainty and  approximate knowledge, capable of adapting to changing operating  conditions (low bandwidth, changing topology and connectivity, and  node failures and mobility, etc.) will be researched. An  architecture and a set of relevant protocols will be designed  and tested on a simulation testbed. An extensive performance  evaluation and prediction will be conducted to evaluate, predict,  and optimize the performance of the developed architectures,  protocols, and algorithms.",
