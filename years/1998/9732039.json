 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732039  Canterna    The Wyoming Infrared Observatory (WIRO) will continue its Summer Undergraduate Research Assistantship Program (SURAP) as a National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site for the summers of 1998, 1999, and 2000. The principal goals of SURAP are:      To introduce the undergraduate student to a realistic and fulfilling experience in astrophysics research, including current concerns on science ethics.      To acquaint each undergraduate student with the diverse research fields in modem astrophysics.      To offer each undergraduate student an opportunity to work directly with active professionals and be given the responsibility to become independent, creative researchers.      To place each undergraduate student in a socially diverse environment which includes student colleagues from different cultural backgrounds and a wide variety of geographical and educational institutions.      To encourage each undergraduate student to publish their results and communicate their research findings at professional meetings.           To expose the undergraduate students to a wide variety of additional scientific and outdoor endeavors unique to the Wyoming and Rocky Mountain region through a series of field trips.    Six to eight participants will be chosen from universities and colleges throughout the nation.   Candidates are selected by faculty advisors, based on their academic performance, interest in a  research career, and recommendations.  The final SURAP participants are chosen to fulfill   SURAP's goal to have students from diverse backgrounds.  Student projects are designed to   match student research interests and be completed within the summer.  Efforts are made to   recruit freshmen and sophomore undergraduates, women, and underrepresented minorities.    A concurrent academic/laboratory course and research seminar will accompany the tutorial research program to help the students place this experience in a wider academic context and provide a general  direction to the program.  This course includes an introduction to modem infrared detectors, image processing, experience in observing with a modem, computer controlled telescope, and academic instruction in fundamental, modem astrophysics.  The focal point of the course will be a student-oriented, temporal monitoring program of interesting astronomical objects (e.g. LPV's, AGN's, CV's) using WIRO's computer-controlled, 24-inch reflector at Red Buttes.  All students, regardless of their principal research program, will participate in acquiring and reducing visual, near IR, and mid-IR photometric data.  In addition, all students will observe at the 2.3 meter telescope with the faculty.  Students who complete research projects with their advisors are encouraged to present their results at a American Astronomical Society meeting or at the National Conference on Undergraduate Research.
