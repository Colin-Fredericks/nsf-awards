 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract    This project will evaluate the interrelationships among  inbreeding, mate choice, and reproduction in the monogamous  old-field mouse.  Inbred juvenile old-field mice are smaller  and suffer increased mortality.  Consequently, adults are  predicted to maximize offspring production by choosing  unrelated mates with which they will produce outbred,  healthier pups.  Inbred adult female old-field mice suffer  reduced fertility.  Therefore, males are predicted to  maximize offspring production by choosing outbred mates.  These predictions will be tested using a controlled  experimental design.  This study will also investigate  potential physiological reasons for the reduced fertility of  inbred adult females.    Habitat fragmentation and over-harvesting continue to reduce  the size of many wild animal populations.  When populations  are small, and are separated from one another by suburbs and  farms, there is increased risk of inbreeding.  It is  important to understand how this can impact population  growth rates.  If inbred adults have reduced fertility and  if they are rejected as potential mates, small inbreeding  populations are at risk of extinction.  However, if animals  distinguish among potential mates based on their degree of  relatedness, the incidence of inbreeding is reduced.  The  old-field mouse will serve as a good model system in which  to address these broadly applicable questions.",
