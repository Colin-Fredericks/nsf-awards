The investigation is a long-term project, and the work as outlined in this proposal is an initial phase of the research. The results of the research will be applied to the  problem of automated recognition of malignant versus benign masses in mammograms.  The long-term goal of the PI is to analyze  the effects of wavelet-based compression on the APR techniques, specifically the use of shape features for classifying mammographic masses. To research this goal, the PI will analytically and empirically assess the scalar-dependence of traditional shape features. The PI will develop distortion measures for compressed images where the distortion is with respect to feature extraction. Finally, she will utilize these measures with the scalar-dependence information to optimize specific compression schemes with regards to compression/APR tradeoffs.  \r\n",
