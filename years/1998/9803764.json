Lewis  Proposal number: DMS-9803764  Title: Midwest Conferences on Partial Differential Equations    This proposal requests partial support for a series of six conferences on the subject of Partial Differential Equations to be held twice a year during the three-year period that starts on June 1, 1998. It is a continuation of a successful series of such meetings, which were partially supported by the National Science Foundation. Partial Differential Equations is one of the subjects in Analysis where substantial progress is taking place and new mathematical ideas are being introduced at a fast pace. PDE keeps providing answers to a manifold of problems arising both in mathematics as well as its applications. These meetings are expected to be very valuable in disseminating the new ideas and problems not only among the experts but also to the general community, especially to young mathematicians and graduate students.",
