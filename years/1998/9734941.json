 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed experiments address a number of issues particularly germane   to excited-state processes and chemistry.  The quantum efficiencies of   the luminescence and the photochemical reactions of aminoarenes and aryl   amides, which have recently been shown to be sensitive to the position of   the amino substituent, will be correlated with precursor structure to   provide insights into structural relaxation of the excited state, and how   that relaxation influences subsequent photophysical and photochemical   processes.   A separate measure of the electronic influence on excited   state behavior will be achieved by measuring the photocyclizations of the   amino-substituted stilbenes, while new information regarding photoinduced   electron transfer and intramolecular charge-transfer states will be   provided through studies of novel donor-acceptor pairs.           With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports the research of Professor Frederick D. Lewis of the Department   of Chemistry at Northwestern University.    Professor Lewis' research   will provide unique insights into the structural changes that accompany   electronic excitation and how these changes, separate from concurrent   electronic changes, influence the subsequent reactivity and relaxation of   intramolecular charge-transfer states.  The research will introduce   undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students to steady-state and   time-resolved photochemical techniques, and their application to   elucidating fundamental excited-state processes.",
