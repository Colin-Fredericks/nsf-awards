 "awd_abstract_narration": "9612895  Prospero     The Indian Ocean Experiment (INDOEX) is an international field experiment with participation from France, Germany, India, the Netherlands, and the United States.  The main effort under the U.S. component focuses on assessing the role of sulfates and other continental aerosols in global radiative forcing and is being supported jointly by the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.  In addition, complementary studies involving investigations of a variety of related chemical and radiative processes will be undertaken by scientists from other federal agencies and other international partners. The composite observing system consists of a wide range of platforms, from ships to aircraft, as well as surface-based and balloon measuring systems, and satellite data. The main part of the three year effort will be a four-month intensive field phase which begins January 1999.     The ultimate goal of this program is to obtain a better understanding of the  decadal and longer time scale climate forcing. The equatorial Indian Ocean during the  northeast winter monsoon season provides a unique natural laboratory for this  experiment. The experimental area is probably the only place in the world where an air  mass which has been modified by intense sources of continental aerosols, anthropogenic  trace species, and their reaction products (e.g., sulfates and ozone) from the northern  hemisphere comes into contact with the pristine air of the southern hemisphere, which has  been transported via cross equatorial monsoonal flow, at the Intertropical Convergence  Zone. The juxtaposition of these two very distinct air masses will allow a thorough  examination of both the direct and indirect effects of the aerosols on the radiative  properties of the atmosphere.     Dr. Prospero and colleagues will develop a climatological data set of the chemical, physical, and radiative characteristics of aerosols in the INDOEX region through a continuous sampling program over two and a half yea rs at an island site in the Maldives. With the expected range in atmospheric conditions over this time, the characteristics of and concentrations in species of aerosols will also vary greatly. The PIs will attempt to associate these chemical and physical variations with changes in atmospheric radiative properties.",
