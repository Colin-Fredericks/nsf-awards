The research goals are to  understand and correlate the mechanisms and controlling factors  of the nucleation and growth of micro-structural phases in  amorphous and other media during laser irradiation treatment. The  work will add to our understanding of excimer laser processing of  a wide range of materials, including glassy ferromagnets. This  project will establish methodology to tune magnetic materials  properties from soft to hard, by affecting the magnetic coupling  between their crystallites. New information on the fundamental  effects underlying the interaction of laser radiation with  partially and completely crystallized metallic glasses will be  obtained, and the possibility of controlling the magnetic texture  and phase equilibrium in thermally-annealed metallic glasses will  be examined by combined application of transmission and  conversion electron Mossbauer spectroscopy, dc hysteresis loops  and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements. The research will  involve undergraduate and graduate students in novel research  activities and will have a significant impact on the scientific  infrastructure at Duquesne University. The project includes the  purchase of a new excimer laser that is essential for the  proposed research.  %%%  This project is by a female scientist at the predominantly  undergraduate educational environment at Duquesne University. The  research employs a novel combination of laser processing and  Mossbauer spectroscopy to produce new materials via micro-  structural processing. The project includes the purchase of a new  excimer laser that is essential for the proposed research. The  laser pulse induces micro-structural changes in textured  materials and this modifies the magnetic and other properties of  the materials. The research will focus on amorphous materials,  particularly amorphous magneti c materials of interest to the  information storage industry. The project will involve both  undergraduate and graduate students in innovative research  projects dealing with materials preparation, Mossbauer  spectroscopy, and in situ laser processing.  ***",
