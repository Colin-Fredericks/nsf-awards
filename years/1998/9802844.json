 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802844  Zwangizer  This award provides partial support for a new nuclear  magnetic resonance spectrometer (NMR) optimized for solid  state materials experiments, for use by the Department of  Chemistry at Indiana University, Bloomington. In conjunction  with the spectrometer, support is provided for the  acquisition of a triple resonance cross-polarization Magic  Angle Spinning NMR probe and  a high power probe for wide  line NMR.    Indiana University has a vigorous and widely known program  in solid-state and materials chemistry.  The proposed  instrument will complement and enhance this program by  providing the laboratories in this area with experimental  capabilities that are acutely needed but not currently  available.  Three areas of research are targeted in this  proposal:  development and study of new glasses and glass  ceramics, and their aging and fatigue behavior; dynamics and  reactivity of gases in molecular solids, in order to design  and optimize chemical sensors; and structural and  mechanistic studies of organometallic polymers and liquid  crystals.  In all three areas, solid-state NMR spectroscopy  can provide essential information on the synthesis,  structure and properties of the target materials.  The  proposed instrument has essential capabilities for study of  the above materials, including:  multi-channel heteronuclear  operation, fast sample spinning, simultaneous  proton/fluorine operation, and wide-line capabilities.  None  of these features are available in spectrometers currently  in the department, but all are necessary to carry out the  proposed research.    Because solid-state NMR has become a powerful but still not  widely used tool in materials science, experience in its use  will be an important and unusual experience for the students  and postdoctoral researchers.  The instrument  will  immediately serve the needs of ten postdoctoral fellows, 16  graduate and three undergraduate students from the three  major user groups and will be available to some 170  ad ditional graduate students and postdoctoral fellows of the  Chemistry Department.  A staff member of the departmental  NMR facility, under the administration of the PI's, will  train and help the users, oversee the use of  the  instrument, perform routine maintenance, instrument  evaluation, and bookkeeping.  %%%  ***",
