 "awd_abstract_narration": "973227O  The Undergraduate Summer Research program at Michigan State  University will support 9 students for each summer. During  the 12-week program each participant will work on a research  project supervised by one of the faculty in the Department  of Biochemistry. Applicants will be recruited from colleges  and universities across the country with a concentration on  schools in the Midwest. Special emphasis will be placed on  recruiting from undergraduate institutions and from colleges  and universities with a high minority enrollment.  Each  student will select a research mentor. All students will  participate in an orientation program and a workshop on  chemical and biology safety and blood-borne pathogens.  During the program the students will participate in a weekly  faculty research seminar series, and in weekly research  meetings of graduate students, undergraduate students and  postdoctoral fellows with their research mentors. Students  will be trained in the use of computers for preparation of  research documents, publication quality figures and slides,  and in the use of computer programs for protein and DNA  modeling and sequence analysis. A presentation will be  organized for participants to discuss career opportunities  in biochemistry including an orientation concerning Ph.D.  program applications presented by the Graduate Programs  Admission Director. At the conclusion of the program, the  students will prepare posters and brief talks on their  research for presentation to faculty, graduate students, and  peers in the Department of Biochemistry. Abstracts of these  presentations will be published in booklet form.",
