The project  strives for an atomic level understanding of structure-property  relationships in semiconducting materials, and a parallel  materials science education program. The research will utilize  recently developed correlated atomic resolution Z-contrast  imaging and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) techniques  in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to probe  internal interfaces and defects in semiconductors with the goal  of determining atomic structure, composition and electronic  structure at individual atomic sites. Electronic and optical  properties of individual interfaces or defects will be modeled  and the overall material properties constructed from fundamental  atomic properties. Unlike traditional high-resolution imaging  techniques, where images and simulations must be matched, this  approach allows real materials defects and interfaces to be  investigated. Research will include GaN and SiC, ITO/n-GaAs,  ZnSe/Fe magnetic multilayers, and the effect of nitrogen on the  oxidation of Si and SiGe for VLSI. The project involves  established collaborations with university materials growth  groups and with industry, incorporating feedback between growth  and characterization related to advanced device concepts and  developments. Atomic scale research studies of semiconductors are  ideal for the integration of research and education. Links  between the operation of an everyday object such as a CD-player  or computer, and the atomic structure of its components, will be  used to emphasize basic features of materials science, and the  excitement of discovery. Similar project based learning ideas  will also be incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum. The  PI will be teaching a new course in experimental materials  physics, where the focus will be on fundamental character ization  and applications of materials. Running parallel to this will be a  graduate course, where experiments will be carried out at higher  levels of sophistication, and related to real world applications.  %%%  The project addresses leading edge research and education issues  in a topical area of materials science having high technological  relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science  knowledge at a fundamental level to electronic materials and  advanced device concepts. An important feature of the program is  the emphasis on education, and on the integration of research and  education through the training of students in a fundamentally and  technologically significant research area.  ***",
