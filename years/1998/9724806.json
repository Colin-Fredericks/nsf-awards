 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724806  Kargon    This award provides support for a workshop on \"Techno  regions:  Science, Technology and Regional Development Past,  Present and Future\" which is being organized by Dr. Robert  Kargon of Johns Hopkins University and Dr. Alberto Carvalho  da Silva of the University of Sao Paulo.    This workshop will gather together U.S. and Brazilian  experts from the areas of science and technology studies,  economics, political science, policy analysis and geography  to discuss the inter-sectoral relations between industry,  government and universities in North and South America.  By  doing this, they hope to increase our understanding of the  origins, structure and function of these relationships  through the comparison of historical and current  developments in the Americas.  They will analyze in  particular, the university-industry relations in \"techno  regions\" such as Silicon Valley, Tsukuba Science City in  Japan and Sophia-Antipolis in France and in the economy  generally.  With this workshop, the participants will study  policy issues surrounding the relationship of research and  development to industrial innovation and growth, knowledge  transfer between government, university and industry, and  the role of regional factors in science policy.  By doing  this, they hope to provide guidance on how to revitalize  older techno-regions in the U.S. and Brazil and to engage  with other regions such as Japan, India, Korea, Thailand and  Singapore, starting cooperation among researchers in the  U.S. and Brazil.  ***",
