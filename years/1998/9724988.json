 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research examines the nature of the most recent phase of gentrification in New York City, which began after the economic recession of the early 1990s and is currently reworking the urban landscape.  Both citywide and neighborhood scales will be examined using eight separate data sets from the Department of City Planning as well as `participant observation' methodologies.  Comparison to two prior phases of post-recession gentrification in New York City will be made.  The study will: (1) contribute to an understanding of the linkages between gentrification and other urban processes as mediated by economic trends; (2) map the experience of gentrification over a twenty-year period; and (3) show how micro-scale market characteristics interact with broader forces of capital investment.  The results are important to academics and managers concerned with urban restructuring and the development of policies that might influence the direction of such restructuring.",
