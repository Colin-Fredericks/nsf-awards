An expedited award is requested to fund Dr. Markus Lesermann as a post-doctoral fellow for six months to carry out these experiments.  Dr. Lesemann is about to complete his post-doctoral appointment in my laboratory and will seek employment beginning this summer unless additional support can be found.  His recent NMR measurements of the CMA for C8E5 in water at kilobar pressures and his recent SANS measurements of C8E5 micelle structure in water at kilobar pressures have been enormously successful, not to mention very promising results.  As a consequence, he has agreed to extend his post-doctoral appointment to finish these exploratory experiments on microemulsions.  The time constraint to secure funding within the next few months is one reason for requesting an expedited review of this exploratory research proposal.  More importantly, though, the results so far, although exciting, are not definitive enough to warrant submission of a full proposal through the conventional NSF peer-review process.  This is the second reason for requesting a small grant for exploratory research.",
