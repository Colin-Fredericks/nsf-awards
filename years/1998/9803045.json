 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803045  Lavernia  This award provides support for the acquisition of a  nanoindenter to serve the research needs of several ongoing,  as well as future research programs dealing with the  synthesis-structure-property studies of nanocrystalline  materials at the University of California at Irvine.  Nanocrystalline materials provide the material  scientist/engineer with the unique opportunity to achieve  combinations of properties that are otherwise unachievable  with equilibrium materials.  For example, nanophase ceramics  are reported to exhibit unusually high ductilities, whereas  nanophase metals are noted to exhibit ultra-high hardness  values.  To that effect, the objective of the research  program proposed herein is to investigate the various  aspects of mechanical properties of nanocrystalline  materials, including powders, coatings and bulk samples  produced at the University of California at Irvine.  More  specifically, the research program will investigate: 1) the  evolution of microhardness of various metals, ceramics and  cermets as a function of grain size during ball milling, 2)  experimental study of the microhardness depth distribution  in thermal sprayed nanocrystalline coatings as a function of  grain size, porosity and second phase dispersoids (dependent  on cooling rate and the coating thickness), 3) Young's  modulus behavior (depending on grain size and porosity of  various nanocrystalline materials), in particular those  present in small dimensions, 4) wear resistance of  nanocrystalline coatings with low porosity, 5) time  dependent properties (strain rate sensitivity, creep and  stress relaxation) of nanocrystalline coatings, and 6) yield  strength of nanocrystalline coatings.  To accomplish these  objectives the following approach is proposed.  First,  mechanical alloying will be used to synthesize  nanocrystalline powders of Al based alloys, Inconel 718, Ni  and WC/Co, emphasizing the control of contamination,  particle size distribution and particle morphology.  Second ,  the mechanically alloyed nanocrystalline powders will be  consolidated using two different approaches: hot pressing,  hot isostatic pressing or hot extrusion and high velocity  oxygen-fuel (HVOF) thermal spraying to prepare  nanocrystalline bulk samples or coatings.  Third, the  physical and mechanical properties of the as-milled,  consolidated and HVOF thermal sprayed nanocrystalline  powders will be studied in detail, paying particular  attention to various nanocrystalline coatings prepared by  high velocity oxygen-fuel spraying.  Moreover, Hall-Petch  strengthening mechanisms in the consolidated nanocrystalline  materials will be studied.  %%%  This instrument will be shared by students and faculty  across the campus at the University of California at Irvine.  It is hoped that this research will impact the growth of  nanocrytalline materials to create bulk 3-D samples having  grain sizes less than 100 nanometers, which would  dramatically increase the performance of all materials that  display this behavior.  This would impact strength of  materials, corrosion resistance, and improve mechanical  performance.  ***",
