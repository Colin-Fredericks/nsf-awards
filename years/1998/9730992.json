The investigators will explore the possibilities for various  classes of designs, especially those associated with good  codes and finite geometrics with large automorphism groups.  Professors Key and Moori will also study the links among the  theories of designs, codes, and groups, especially the use  of algebraic coding theory and group theory, in the  investigation and classification of combinatorial designs,  with a particular emphasis on designs and codes arising from  finite geometrics. The proposed collaboration combines  Professor Key's expertise in group theory and problems  associated with the classification of designs and their  codes with Professor Moori's expertise in the theory of  finite groups and their representations.  The Division of  International Programs and the Division of Mathematical  Sciences are jointly providing funding for this project.",
