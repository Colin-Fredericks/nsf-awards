 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806247  Pugh    The objective of this proposat is to synthesize and characterize  a series of well-defined side-chain liquid crystalline polymers  (SCLCPs) with different molecular architectures in order to  determine if mixtures of chemically identical SCLCPs with  different types of branching and branching densities are either  immiscible or have limited miscibitity, and thereby cause the  broad phase transitions often exhibited by SCLCPs synthesized by  conventional radical polymerizations.  Linear, comb,  hyperbranched, and 3-, 6- and 12-arm star poly{11- (4'cyanophenyl-  4\"-phenoxy)undecyl  acrylate}s will be prepared by atom transfer  radical polymerization.  The miscibility of the different  molecular architectures and its effect on the breadth of their  phase transitions will be determined by comparing the  thermotropic behavior of each of the molecular architectures with  that of their binary blends and unmixed composites.  The GPC-  determined molecular weights of the polymers will be compared  with the molecular weights determined by light scattering  measurements and/or MALDI-MS.  The star polymers are designed so  that the arms can be cleaved subsequent to polymerization in  order to compare the molecular weight of the arms with that of  the original star polymers, and to determine the uniformity of  the arm lengths from their polydispersity in molecular weight.  The shape and compactness of the different architectures will be  studied by determining how their radius of gyration (light  scattering) and intrinsic viscosities scale with molecular  weight.  Atthough there are extensive experimental results on the  solution and melt properties of polymers (eg. polyethylene,  polystyrene and polybutadiene) with a variety of well-defined  molecular architectures, none have involved polymers with a large  side-chain in every repeat unit.  The synthesis and solution and  solid-state characterization of SCLCPs will therefore greatly  expand our fundamentat understanding of the physical chem istry of  polymers.  This work will also provide the only quantitative  kinetic data in the field of SCLCPs; chain transfer constants to  polymer will be determined from the Mayo equation and standard  kinetic measurements using model chain transfer agents  representing a broad range of chemical structures typical of  SCLCPs.  %%%  This research is in the area of novel materials with precisely  controlled molecular architectures and liquid-crystalline  properties.  ***",
