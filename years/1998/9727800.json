This research focuses on the extensive peat deposits in the discontinuous permafrost regions of boreal, continental, western Canada, where new findings suggest that permafrost has been melting in recent years, possibly in response to warming climatic conditions.  Both field and laboratory studies will be conducted to test hypotheses related to carbon balance and peat accumulation/degradation.  The research is structured around four questions: 1) How does the presence, absence, or disappearance of permafrost affect peat accumulation rate and peat organic matter quality in peatlands of the discontinuous permafrost region? 2) How does the presence, absence, or disappearance of permafrost affect CO2 and CH4 production/emission and controls on production/emission in peatlands of the discontinuous permafrost region?  3) Will the carbon balance of peat underlain by permafrost be tipped from peat as a sink for atmospheric carbon to a net source of carbon to the atmosphere as permafrost melts? and 4) Do roots contribute substantially to CO2 and CH4 production/emission in peatlands in the discontinuous permafrost zone?  By understanding the factors that affect CO2 and CH4 production and emission, the work will lead to insights into the potential carbon cycling responses of these extensive peatlands to projected regional and global climate changes in general, and to ongoing permafrost degradation and melting more specifically.",
