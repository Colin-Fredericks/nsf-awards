 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study proposes to study the biological diversity of St. Matthew Islands, a remote archipelago located in the center of the Bering Sea.  This archipelago is an isolated remnant of a formerly more extensive Beringian ecosystem.  They offer the chance to sample directly the remnants of a region that has had important effects on the fauna of two continents.  Beringia today represents an area of considerable interest to arctic science, and this archipelago is host to several endemic species and populations.  The PIs plan to collect tissue and specimens of plants, mammals, birds, and invertebrates for further systematic and ecological study.  These surveys will be the first comprehensive study of the biota, and the PIs will compare their findings with historical collections and will provide baseline data for studies of the effects of global change in the Arctic.  Travel to St. Matthew is extremely difficult and expensive because of the isolation and logistical requirements.  The PIs plan to take advantage of unique opportunity afforded by USFWS, which is providing space for the PIs aboard their research vessel R/V Tiglax on a cruise to nearby Hall Island.  Because the logistical demands are extreme and the window for opportunity is time-sensitive, the PIs have chosen to submit a proposal of limited scope under the guidelines of the Small Grants for Exploratory Research (SGER) program.",
