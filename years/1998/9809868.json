 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies the degree to which the phonological speech norms of the 'Northern Cities Shift' (NCS) have become a general model for southeastern and central Michigan speakers. In particular, we propose to investigate the degree to which these largely urban and majority group norms are or are not being acquired by three specific minority or non-urban populations: African-American, Appalachian, and rural European-American.  The work of this project will be based upon a compilation and analysis of previous relevant research on local varieties. Once it is determined what existing data are available, a principal goal of this project will be to 'fill in' research not yet accomplished for any of these groups (including data collection, transcription, analysis, and interpretation), providing a large body of data for future research as well as for the current project.  Mainly, this project hopes to provide an account for 1) the vowel systems of the groups under study, with reference to theoretical (i.e., explanatory) accounts of both their synchronic and emerging states, and 2) the social factors which contribute to (or retard) the group's participation in an on-going, surrounding majority linguistic change.  This project also provides for the dissemination of new findings on language variation and change in southeastern and central Michigan, typically through journal articles and conference presentations; some doctoral dissertations as well will doubtless focus on these data.",
