While Purdue focuses on developing close collaboration with industry in conducting the research, Tuskegee places more emphasis on enhancing its research capability and on its equallu important objectives in education.  This project will provide a meaningful linkup between these two Centers, from which both Centers will benefit in fulfilling and expanding their goals.  The research proposed is to develop connectors for joining composite structural components which calls for an integrated design, analysis, and manufacture of efficient and effective connectors for tubular and sandwich composite structures.",
