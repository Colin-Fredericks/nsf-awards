 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface   Chemistry Program, focusses on the development of quinoprotein   enzyme based biosensors for the analysis of histamine, dopamine,   and alcohols.  Professors Tachikawa of Jackson State University   and Davidson of The University of Mississippi Medical Center and   their students will study the preparation and characterization   of biosensors using the enzymes methylamine dehydrogenase,   aromatic amine dehydrogenase, and methanol dehydrogenase.    Electrochemical methods, electrochemical quartz crystal   microbalance measurements, and Raman spectroscopy will be used   to characterize the structure and function of these enzyme based   biosensors. This project is unique in using oxygen and NAD   independent redox enzymes in biosensors and in the long-term   medical applications are anticipated.  This project will examine the utility of developing enzyme based  biosensors that use oxygen and NA independent quinoprotein  enzymes.  Professors Tachikawa of Jackson State University and  Davidson of The University of Mississippi Medical Center will  study the construction and characterization of these biosensors  with their students.  A broad, interdisciplinary approach to this  project will involve use of electrochemical techniques, quartz  crystal microbalance measurements, and Raman spectroscopy to  determine the structure and properties of these new biosensors.   Long-term goals focus on developing new applications for  quantitative and qualitative analysis in medicine.",
