Since  1995, an interdisciplinary group of faculty members and graduate  students from several departments was formed at Kansas State  University (KSU). The common interest of this cohesive group is to  share research results, research equipment, and laboratory  experiences in the areas of non-contact sensors, instrumentation,  data acquisition, precision positioning, and digital signal  processing.  This activity enjoys a great support from the  university, state agencies and private industry. In addition to  university and private sector support, the Manufacturing Learning  Center (MLC) within the university s Advance Manufacturing  Institute(AMI) provides a unique opportunity for conveying research  results to the private sector. Based on past experience, one  expects that the anticipated new research results will greatly  benefit the small to medium-sized progressive manufacturers in  Kansas as well as the nation.  Four critical areas of research in  Non-Contact Precision Measurement (NCPM) have been identified:   laser sensors, acoustic emission, computer vision, and radiation  sensors. These research areas encompass the majority of non-contact  diagnostic technologies frequently applied in manufacturing  environments. Examples of real-life applications include gear  profile inspection; high precision surface structure diagnosis;  non-contact evaluation of nodularity in casting irons; and non-  contact printed circuit board plating thickness inspection.",
