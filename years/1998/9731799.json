 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates efficient manipulation of finite groups  and estimation of their parameters.  Potential application areas  include computational group theory, graph isomorphism testing (of  relevance to chemical documentation), efficient interconnection  networks based on groups, and possibly, group-based cryptography.  The main focus is on the design and analysis of efficient  algorithms for large group theoretic problems.  These algorithms  combine profound recent results of group theory with new  elementary combinatorial structure theory and estimates, from  which an entirely new algorithmic methodology emerged.  Some of  the algorithms work in the generality of black box groups, hence  they can be applied both in the matrix group and the permutation  group setting.  The project will refine and extend the  construction of natural representation of classical matrix groups  from arbitrary representations.    Several \"pure\" algebraic and combinatorial problems are also  being studied.  In particular, the interest is in base size  problems for permutation groups, problems concerning the action  of groups on the power set of the permutation domain, and  problems related to Cayley graphs: the diameter of Cayley graphs  and the investigation of non-Cayley graphs with vertex-transitive  automorphism group.  Small bases are important for fast  implementations and for improving the running time estimates of  algorithms.  Estimates of diameters of Cayley graphs are closely  related to the expansion rate and through this to a host of basic  questions of the theory of computing and probability theory.",
