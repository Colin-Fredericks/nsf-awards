Abrahamson & Micky Eubanks    New species are known to arise when geographic barriers divide an  existing species into two or more isolated populations. When mountains,  oceans, or other barriers prevent reproduction between the isolated  populations, each can evolve along an independent path. If geographic  isolation lasts long enough, the populations may diverge so much that  interbreeding is no longer possible -- one species divides into several.  With parasites such as herbivorous insects, barriers to genetic exchange  may arise not out of geography, but out of behavior. When mating occurs  only on the host plant, a subpopulation consistently choosing one host will  not mate with that choosing the other. Thus, speciation can occur in the  absence of geographic separation when the two subpopulations are sympatric.  Many have argued that the conditions for sympatric speciation are too  restrictive for it to be important. Our extensive work on flies that induce  galls on goldenrod plants and our preliminary work with a stem and  gall-boring beetle indicate that host choice can be a barrier to genetic  exchange. We will study a host shift and potential host-race formation by a  common tumbling flower beetle associated with two species of goldenrod in  the eastern United States. Our study system is unique in that a host shift  and subsequent host-race formation by one herbivorous insect may have  directly contributed to the host shift and host-race formation of a second,  unrelated species. Given that nearly half of animal species are parasites,  sympatric speciation may be an important source of the earth's  biodiversity.",
