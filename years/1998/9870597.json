A  particular objective of the research is to further develop  and apply an effective field theory that allows a systematic  treatment of electronic systems in the presence of  impurities.  The methods employed include general field  theoretic techniques, the renormalization group, and many-  body perturbation theory.  Specific systems for which this  work is relevant include magnets with impurities,  superconductors, and doped semiconductors.  %%%   This is a theoretical research grant with the objective to  enhance current understanding of many-electron systems at  very low temperatures, and especially of phase transitions  and other collective phenomena in these systems.
