 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: John Tucker  Proposal Number: DMS 9714380  Project: Statistical Methods in Computational Modeling and            Virtual Experiments    Abstract:    The Committee on Applied and Theoretical Statistics (CATS)  will convene a multidisciplinary study panel on statistical  methods in computational modeling and virtual experiments.  The panel will recommend sound methods for identifying and   quantifying uncertainties that arise in simulation experiments.  The panel will develop recommendations for improved and, where  necessary, new statistical methods and data analysis techniques  for use in simulation modeling and virtual experiments.  It will  also recommend appropriate statistical methods to assist  practitioners in their use of experimental data when validating  simulation models or assessing model fit and predictive   performance. These recommendations will address modeling and  simulation limitations associated with ever increasingly complex  systems. The panel's report will provide examples to illustrate  the complexity of evaluating model combinations that arise from  varying assumptions, parameters, and initial conditions within   the models, will point out possible approaches for addressing  those complexities from existing experimental design techniques,  and will highlight areas needing further research. Experts may   be consulted from the communities concerned with computer  simulation, discrete events systems, and dynamic systems  modeling, and any other scientists, researchers, or engineers  with significant technology or methodology to contribute.    A National Research Council panel of experts will examine the   state-of-the-art for statistical methods used in computer  simulation and modeling, and computational experimentation. This  is needed because of an ever-growing dependence upon these kinds  of simulations and \"virtual\" experiments in designing and  evaluating such complicated devices and systems as semiconductors,  automobiles, aircraft, spacecraft, or in very complex  application  areas such as transportation networks, government intelligence, and  battlefield scenarios. The study will address how modeling and  simulation tools can be developed with the robustness and  reliability to handle the demands of emerging intelligence,  domestic, and military technology. It will also look at limitations  on modeling and simulation with respect to these increasingly   complex systems.",
