Building quality  computer systems that can meet user needs effectively and  reliably is currently a major problem. Formal methods that  can be partially or completely automated provide a promising  approach to this problem. A three-day workshop on this subject  is  proposed,  to  take  place in Carmel.  The  purposes  of  the  workshop are to identify criteria for determining potential  practical impact of automatable methods for engineering  of  computer based systems, to assess current research efforts in  this  area, to identify results and directions that can  increase  the  degree of automation, to aid tool integration by building  a  common understanding, and to increase the practical use of formal  methods via automation.***",
