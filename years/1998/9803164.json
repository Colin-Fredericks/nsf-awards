Of particular interest are systems defined on unbounded domains \r\nand infinite dimensional Hamiltonian systems.  In such systems it is often \r\nnot obvious what the principal modes and mechanisms governing the \r\nstability or instability of solutions are.  A main thrust of the research \r\nproject will be to identify invariant, finite-dimensional objects in the phase \r\nspace of these systems which govern the long-time behavior of solutions.  \r\nAmong the specific examples to be studied are dissipative partial \r\ndifferential equations like the Cahn-Hilliard equation or systems of \r\nreaction-diffusion equations, which will be analyzed using invariant \r\nmanifold theorems, and infinite dimensional Hamiltonian systems to \r\nwhich will be attempted to extend the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser \r\nTheorem.  Finally, the project will include attempts to give rigorous \r\nestimates of the validity of some of the modulation equations used to \r\napproximate traveling waves in fluid mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe sorts of equations that will be studied arise in many applications such \r\nas the formation of patterns in biological and physical systems, \r\ncrystallization, and the motion of waves in the ocean.  They are all \r\ncharacterized by the fact that even though it is impossible to solve the \r\nequations which govern their motion explicitly, applications require at \r\nleast a qualitative understanding of the behavior of their solutions.  This \r\nresearch is aimed both at providing such a qualitative understanding, and \r\nalso at explaining the limits of such approximate solutions.  A prime \r\nexample of this situation is the study of tsunamis.  It is experimentally \r\nobserved that disturbances of the ocean surface generate large, solitary \r\nwaves which travel enormous distances over the sea surface without \r\nchange of form.  It is impossible to solve the equations which describe \r\nsuch waves exactly, and while a number of model equations which \r\ndescribe such traveling waves exist, the mathematical justification of such \r\nmodels is lacking.  One of the goals of the research in this proposal is to \r\ngive a rigorous derivation of the approximate equations that govern wave \r\nmotion of fluid surfaces. This will both help to clarify which of the various \r\nphysical models gives the best description of the actual waves, and should \r\nalso shed light on how better models can be developed.\r\n",
