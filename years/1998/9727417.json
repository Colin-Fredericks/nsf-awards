 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr Michael T. Pope, Chemistry Department, Georgetown University, is   supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program,  to investigate the chemistry of polyoxometalate species.  This   research is directed towards developing robust, water-stable,   functionalized organic derivatives of (a) polytungstate anions containing   10-30 tungsten atoms and one to several other atom types that can be used   as sites of further derivatization and (b) massive, soluble discrete   polyoxoanions of nanoscale dimensions that contain 100+ metal atoms. The   ability to derivatize rhodium containing type (a) complexes at the   rhodium will be used to couple the polyoxometalate to ribosomes for   phasing of x-ray data. Additional type (a) species will be prepared with   multiple sites for derivatization. These species can be utilized for   supporting agents to attach catalytically active polyoxoanions to polymer   substrates, for selective electron-density imaging, and other   applications. Type (b) complexes are exemplified by a 76- anion   containing 12 As, 16 Ln, 148 W, and 524 O atoms plus 36 water molecules.   This anion is water soluble and has been crystallographically   characterized. Synthetic strategies will be designed for analogues of   this species in which As is substituted by other group 15 atoms and for   those that contain a variety of lanthanides. The preparation of even   larger clusters will be devised. The hydrolytic stability, structures,   electrochemistry and other properties will be investigated in solution    for these large anions. Methods will be designed to couple these clusters   anions into designed, extended assemblies.  The polyoxometalates are a large ions composed of metal and  oxygen   atoms. They are of interest because they are wholly inorganic, and thus   should be quite robust under many conditions. This investigation will   explore the chemistry of two classes of these ions. The first contains   10-30 metal atoms  and has centers that can be linked to other chemical   species. The second class is composed of very massive ions that contain   hundreds of atoms and are nano-sized. Both classes are unusual for   because they dissolve in and are stable in water. They  have potential   applications as ion-exchange and host/guest materials, catalysts,   conducting and magnetic materials, and display devices.",
