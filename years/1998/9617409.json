 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports the continuation of the JGOFS core measurement component of the Hawaii Ocean Time series (HOT) program for an additional three years. This HOT JGOFS proposal includes 4 separate, but fully integrated proposals: core measurement component (D. Karl, L. Tupas and D. Hebel, co P.I.s), pigment and phytoplankton component (R. Bidigare, P.I.), inorganic carbon (C.' Winn, P.I.) and zooplankton (M. Landry, P.I.). Since Oct 1988, a comprehensive suite of ocean measurements and results of in situ experiments have been obtained at the oligotrophic Station ALOHA (22'45N, 158'00'W) in the subtropical North Pacific Ocean. The core measurements were selected to provide a data set to validate existing C-N P biogeochemical models and, if necessary, to improve them. Foremost in importance among the various ecosystem processes under investigation are: the flux of carbon at the air sea interface, the rates and control mechanisms of primary production and particle export, and the pathways and intensities of inorganic nutrient (N and P) fluxes. Equally important are the observed time dependent changes in microbial biomass and biodiversity, and the relationships of these observed ecosystem changes to the broader extratropical climate forcing such as El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and other large scale ocean atmosphere interactions. The emergent data set from the HOT program is unique, robust and rich with previously undocumented phenomena. The HOT program data base is fully accessible with unrestricted use by anyone through the worldwide Internet system (ftp) and, more recently, via the world wide web with only an approximately 6 12 month processing delay. The scientific results of the HOT research program have provided an unprecedented view of biogeochemical cycles in a previously undersampled region of the world ocean. Numerous HOT related publications and reports have already appeared based on the research results obtained by a broad spectrum of HOT program associated and independent scientists. At the same time, this ocean research program has provided an unique educational opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students from Hawaii and around the world, both in terms of at sea field experience and in the classroom working with the computer accessible HOT program environmental data sets. Funding will be used to continue this successful ocean time series core measurement program for the period Aug 1998 to July 2001 and supplement these measurements with an additional mooring.",
