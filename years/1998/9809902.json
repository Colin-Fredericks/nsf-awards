 "awd_abstract_narration": "9809902\r\nSteinman\r\nOne of the enigmatic features of bacterial stationary phase is the involvement of antioxidant enzymes. The involvement is curious because electron transport to oxygen, the major source of reactive oxygen species during exponential growth, is severely attenuated in stationary phase. Classic studies in E. coil have led to the \"anticipation mechanism\": that antioxidant enzymes are involved in the stationary phase response in anticipation of the high flux of reactive oxygen species that will be encountered when rapid growth is resumed.\r\n\r\nThe research of this project is based on the hypothesis that the anticipation mechanism is not an appropriate model for non-enteric obligate aerobes. Legionella pneumophila, the causative organism of Legionnaires' pneumonia, is the subject of the study. The Pl's laboratory has shown that the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SodC) of L. pneumophila is induced 2-fold in stationary phase and that a sodC null mutant is decreased in stationary phase survival by 3-6 orders of magnitude.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the research will be to isolate suppressors of the stationary phase survival phenotype. By characterization of their mechanism of suppression it will be possible to determine which of the 3 possible alternatives to the anticipation mechanism is operative in L. pneumophila: [a] sources of reactive oxygen in stationary phase other than aerobic respiration, [b] synthesis of oxidation-sensitive biomolecules or decreased repair in stationary phase, and [c] alternative functions of the CuZnSOD that do not involve decomposition of superoxide.\r\n\r\nCertain organisms that cause human disease are not spread from human to human but are spread from environmental sources to humans. The Legionnaires' disease bacterium is one such pathogen. One infected human does not infect another. Rather, the bacterium is spread in air-borne particles that originate from environmental sources such as air conditioning ducts, respirators, and water cooling towers. Each of these environmental sources lacks sufficient nutrients for the Legionnaires' disease bacterium to grow. In ways that are not understood, the bacterium survives the starvation conditions in its environmental reservoirs and is able to become infective once air-borne particles containing it are breathed by susceptible human or animal hosts. The research to be performed in this study will determine fundamental molecular processes underlying the survival of the Legionnaires' disease bacterium in starvation conditions. This information may be helpful in eradicating this pathogen from the environmental sources in which it usually survives. Such an eradication would prevent the infection of susceptible human hosts and curb this disease.\r\n\r\n",
