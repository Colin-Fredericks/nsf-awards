 "awd_abstract_narration": "Northeastern University has developed a concept - known as ELMOs (for Embedded Learning Modules) program - for naturally integrating progressive learning experiences in science and technology throughout non-science curricula.  We are developing, implementing, and evaluating a set of integrated laboratory and field experiences that will be naturally embedded within required major courses in non-science curricula.  Our ELMO model explicitly uses reinforcement learning in which students experience an integrated set of progressive, cumulative experiences in order to develop a coherent understanding of key concepts, methodologies, and principles.  Each set of experiences are designed by cross-disciplinary teams of science, engineering, and non-science faculty members to mesh seamlessly with study within a particular non-science 'client' major so that students will recognize the direct relevance of science and technology to their disciplinary interests.  For example, music students are introduced to wave phenomena through physics and engineering experiments in their music courses as they study such topics as the production of sound by various instruments, and the acoustical design   of auditoriums for optimal sound effects.  These laboratory experiments are supplemented by field experiences in which students interact with professionals in their disciplines to understand the direct applications of science and technology in their work - e.g., in the form of visits to local symphony halls and theaters for the study and evaluation of various acoustical designs and through joint interviews with performers and acoustical engineers.  We contend that students only retain knowledge and skills that they want to retain; if science and technology seem irrelevant to their academic and career interests, they will simply complete whatever introductory required courses in these areas that they must - and promptly forget the principles and concepts that they learned. Thus, it is critical that non-science majors r ecognize the relevance of science, mathematics, engineering, and technology  SME&T  in their lives. The ELMO project embeds pertinent SME&T coursework in selected required and sequential courses in non-science curricula, thereby achieving this objective. An ELMO Science and Engineering Laboratory Clinic is being constructed and staffed for this project, representing a substantial financial investment by the university and reflecting its long-term commitment to this project.  We are convinced that students will acquire and retain both broader and deeper understanding of concepts and principles in science and technology through the ELMO program than they do under the traditional general education formats currently in place at most undergraduate institutions.",
