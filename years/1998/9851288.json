 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Engineering Science Department at MCC has a two stage plan for providing students with  improved modeling and design experiences. In the first stage, the Engineering Science  department will more fully integrate modeling and design in both the engineering circuits and  mathematics courses in the program. The second stage will incorporate the use of 3D solid  modeling in our engineering graphics class along with a design and build project which will  involve a student team consisting of both Engineering Science and Tooling and Machining  students.  Implementation of both stages of this plan requires the addition of 14 computers, Mathematical  and AutoCAD software, and a later printer to our Engineering Science laboratory. This  equipment would be installed in the summer of 1998 and would be ready for use in the fall of  1998. The first stage will begin with the integration of the curricula of Calculus 3 (MTH 212)  with Introductory Circuits (ENR 253) in the fall of 1998. Mathematical software will be used in  the Circuits (ENR 254) laboratory to model analog circuits. Math and Engineering faculty will  work closely so that the examples used in Calculus are relevant to circuit modeling and analysis.  During the Spring of 1999, a similar approach will be used with Differential Equations (MTH  225) and Circuits (ENR 254).  In the fall of 1999, the second stage will begin with the use of 3D solid modeling with AutoCad in  the engineering graphics class (ENR 153). In addition to creating computer models of  mechanical assemblies, students will also work in teams with students from the MCC Tooling and  Machining department to complete a design and build project.",
