 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported in the   Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focuses on the   spectrofluorometric study of chemistry involving novel macromolecular   media, dendrimers.  Dendrimers are highly-branched, three-dimensional   polymers whose structures include cavity microvolumes which are being   investigated for use in areas such as chemical separations and drug   delivery.  Professor Tucker and her students will use a variety of   optical probes to study structure-function relationships in a   systematically varying family of dendrimers proposed for use in   separations applications.  This CAREER project includes the development   of a course entitled `Interviewing and Job Skills for Success in the   Sciences`.  Professor Tucker will also conduct weekend workshops for Girl   Scouts entitled `The Magic of Chemistry`.  There is a great deal of interest in the development of novel chemical   compounds which effectively act to encapsulate other ions or molecules to   transport them into and out of target systems.  One such group of   compounds is the dendrimers.  Dendrimers are three-dimensional polymers   which are being evaluated intensely for use in chemical separations and   in drug delivery applications.  Professor Tucker and her students will   study the chemistry of dendrimers using optical spectroscopy to probe   structure-function relationships.  Graduate and undergraduate students   will gain insights through a course devoted to interviewing and job   skills in the scientific workplace.  Girl Scouts will be exposed to the   `The Magic of Chemistry` in an effort to bridge the science gender gap.",
