 "awd_abstract_narration": "9809815  Karniadakis    A new class of projection methods, the Discontinuous Galerkin Methods (DGM),  has been developed recently and has found its use very quickly in such diverse applications as aeroacoustics, semi-conductor device simulation, turbomachinery, turbulent flows, materials processing, MHD and plasma simulations, and image processing. While there has been a lot of interest from mathematicians, physicists and engineers in DGM, only scattered information is available and there has been no prior effort in organizing and publishing the existing volume of knowledge on this subject.    The authors of this proposal plan to organize the first international symposium on DGM with equal emphasis on the theory, numerical implementation, and applications. They plan to publish a book to serve as the first reference on this subject with both review articles and state-of-the-art contributions presented at the symposium. The Symposium will include both invited papers as well as other contributions in order to encourage wider participation especially from young scientists and under-represented minorities.",
