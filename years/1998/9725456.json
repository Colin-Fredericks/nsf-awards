 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725456  Williams    This grant provides three-years partial salary support for an  electron microprobe (EMP) technician at the University of  Massachusetts.  This is a Phase I technician support (TS) request  under the Instrumentation and Facilities (IF) Program.  Initially, Dr. Michael Jercinovic will help these investigators  establish new analytical procedures on their Cameca SX-50 EMP  using a recently acquired automation and imaging package (EAR-  9503054).  Salary support will cover a transition period as they  spin up new analytical procedures using their newly upgraded EMP  and acquire outside contracts that will eventually provide  revenues to replace NSF support.  The facility not only supports  the petrologic and materials research programs of faculty within  the Department of Geology and the College of Engineering, but  also the research programs of several other regional faculty and  their undergraduate students (i.e. Smith College, Williams  College, Amherst College, Mount Holyoke and Colgate University).  Jercinovic will focus on developing new analytical procedures  including development of the remote control module that shipped  with the new SX-100 software.  This feature allows for some  remote operations of the EMP via the internet and can return  backscattered electron images in a similar fashion.  Remote  operation offers an important advance for educational purposes at  regional colleges that do not have direct access to a functioning  analytical grade EMP.  ***",
