 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804107  Jasperson    The Center for Atmospheric and Space Sciences (CASS) at Augsburg College, in collaboration with the Science Museum of Minnesota, is developing three exhibit clusters on important weather and climate systems that affect our everyday lives.  Each cluster will consist of a micro-computer-based exhibit that runs a mathematical model of the weather system, a supporting three-dimensional display that encapsulates the entire system, a physical interactive exhibit that teaches critical physical concepts, and a graphical environment that reinforces connections to visitors' personal knowledge and interests.   The three weather systems that constitute the content of the exhibit will be selected from the following four options:  mid-latitude cyclones and the weather they cause, the cycle of ice ages over the past million years, global warming and greenhouse gases, and physical features on the earth that have profound effects on local climates.  These exhibit clusters will build on the previous interactive exhibit components developed by Augsburg College:  Seasons, Winds, and Clouds.     All three exhibit and program clusters will be designed so they can be placed in science and natural history museums nationwide.  The computer models will be designed to run on common, inexpensive microcomputers and will be disseminated to museums, libraries, other public sites, and schools.       The project content and educational design will be developed by the PI, William Jasperson, a Senior Research Scientist at CASS, working with two of his fellow Senior Research Scientists, David Venne and Anthony Hansen, and with Geanine Gregoire from the Department of Education at Augsburg College.  J. Shipley Newlin and James Roe, will be responsible for exhibit design and development at the science museum.",
