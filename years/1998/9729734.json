 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729734  Schaefer    This project involves the combination of solid-state, magic-angle  spinning, dipolar-recoupling NMR experiments, with generalized  Langevin dynamics simulations, for the characterization of the  chain motion of a new generation of engineering polymers. The  polymers are based on polycarbonate-like structures that have  enhanced mechanical or optical properties. The NMR is used to  measure interchain distances that act as constraints on the  molecular dynamics simulations. This combination of experiment  and theory should lead to a better understanding of the  connection between microscopic chain motion and macroscopic  polymer properties. The specific systems whose chain dynamics  will be investigated are: (i) polycarbonates with specifically  fluorinated phenyl rings; (ii) high-Tg polycarbonate-polyester  block copolymers; (iii) non-linear hyperbranched polycarbonates;  and (iv) polycarbonates with main and side-chain cyclohexyl  rings.  %%%   The polymers that will be characterized by solid-state NMR and  molecular dynamics simulations in this proposal are of current  interest to industry. A tough, cheap replacement for  polycarbonate that has a lower birefringence to enable more  information to be packed on compact disks is a commercial goal  for a number of industries.. The ability to combine theory and  experiment in fundamental work on problems that also are of great  practical interest guarantees an efficient transfer to the  American materials industry of the basic polymer science and  technology developed at Washington University under NSF  sponsorship.  ***",
