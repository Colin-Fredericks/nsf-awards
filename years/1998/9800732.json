 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prof. Isenberg will continue a program of research which  focuses primarily on the study of the behavior of  cosmological solutions of Einstein's equations.  Employing  tools from geometrical analysis and nonlinear partial  differential equation theory, his research involves the  study of solutions of the Einstein constraint equations, the  study of long-time existence and behavior of solutions of  the Einstein field equations near singular regions as well  as near asymptotic expansion regions, and the study of  spacetimes with Cauchy horizons.  This research program also  includes analysis of other geometrically-based partial  differential equations, including Ricci flow and wave maps.  Einstein's field equations, besides providing the best  current description of the behavior of gravitational physics  on the astrophysical and cosmological scales, is also the  source of a rich collection of mathematically interesting  questions.  This project seeks support for a program of  research which focuses on some of these.  Part of the aim of  this proposed work is to increase the interaction of ideas  and tools in mathematics and theoretical physics.",
