 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent reviews of science education and geoscience education in particular stress that pedagogy focus on processes of inquiry in science, that it enable the student to make the observations we, as scientists, make ask the questions we ask, and learn the way we learn. Traditional exercises in environmental studies and geology, general y conducted in a classroom setting, tend to dissociate data analysis from data collection, resulting in a lack of context between the data and the environment from which they are collected. The objective of this project is to create and adapt laboratory experiences in environmental studies and geology so that they promote active inquiry in a field setting by students as they begin ~o understand the physical and chemical attributes of hydrologic systems. Flow Probe Handheld Flowmeters and Hach DREL/2000 Water Quality Laboratories will support introductory laboratories for science and non-science majors and advanced laboratories and independent studies for majors in the area of physical and chemical hydrology. The laboratory experiences utilizing this equipment are intended to blur the distinction between lecture and laboratories, making the lecture a forum for active inquiry into environmental or geologic questions and the laboratory a practice ground for answering them. The experiences range from evaluating land use impacts on water quality in an introductory course to measuring hydraulic differences between bedrock and alluvial channel reaches in an advanced course. The expected outcome is a student community of critical thinkers and writers, science and non-science students alike, that understands geology and the environment through their understanding and utilization of the scientific method.",
