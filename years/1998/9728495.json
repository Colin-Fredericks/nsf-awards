Semlitsch, H.  C.Gerhardt, and P. A. Mahoney      Non-Technical Summary         In most biological species, each individual's genetic  constitution is a unique mixture of genes from both of its  parents.  This unique combination of genes has a pervasive  influence on an individual's appearance, behavior and  physiology.  The choice of a mate, then, can have a profound  impact on the characteristics of an animal's offspring.  Indeed, evidence suggests that female preferences have  evolved to become both striking and instinctual.  Our  research directly examines the effect of female mate-choice  on offspring performance and tests the idea that a female  does prefer males that carry genes which increase the vigor  of her offspring.  This will be carried out by mating each  of a series of females to two males (a preferred male and a  non-preferred male) rearing the two types of offspring and  measuring the differences between them in survival, growth  and maturation rates.  This work will be carried out using  an ideal species for such research, the gray treefrog, a  North American species with distinct and well understood  mating preferences and behaviors.  An important aspect of  this research is the use of neutral genetic markers (using  modern molecular methods to directly detect differences in  differences in DNA) to identify the father of each of the  juveniles.  This allows us to rear the offspring in mixed  groups under natural conditions outdoors.  A demonstration  of a difference in performance between offspring of  preferred versus non-preferred fathers will provide evidence  that there is a genetic mechanism that can contribute to the  evolution of female mate preferences. This result will  provide evidence supporting a critical link in the theory of  how mate choice has and continues to evolve.",
