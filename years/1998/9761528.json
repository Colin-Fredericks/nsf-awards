 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9761528  Juhasz    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the scientific, technical and commercial feasibility of laser surgical systems for the treatment of glaucoma.  The project will focus on the engineering and development of a novel laser delivery system as well as proof of concept of its application.  The project is executed in collaboration between Escalon Medical Corporation and the University of Michigan.  Approximately two million Americans have glaucoma, while another ten million are at risk of developing this disease due to elevated eye pressure.  Drug treatments for glaucoma are only modestly effective and are associated with side effects and poor patient compliance.  Current laser and traditional surgical treatments also have limited success in preserving vision.  Current pulsed laser systems deposit large amounts of thermal energy into the tissue.  The result is extensive damage to adjacent structures and complicated by scarring.  Near infrared ultrashort pulsed lasers are uniquely qualified to perform improved laser glaucoma surgical techniques, since energy threshold requirements for tissue ablation are nearly 100 times less than with existing pulsed clinical lasers.  This translates into minimal damage to adjacent structures and greatly reduced scarring.  Successful completion of the proposed project will identify optimal laser and delivery parameters which will allow us to design a commercial prototype in the Phase II project.  ***",
