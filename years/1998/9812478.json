 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812478  Krawinkler  Control of damage is a critical issue that is not addressed  adequately in present seismic design procedures, and the ground  motions near the ruptured fault segments can be much greater and  of different characteristics than the ground motions considered  in present design procedures.  In particular, near-fault ground  motions contain pulse-type characteristics that are not captured  by the spectral representations of today's codes.  Damage control  and other important performance levels are being addressed in  performance based engineering approaches that are under  development in various organizations.    The objective of this research project is to develop knowledge  that permits the incorporation of near-fault effects in a  performance based seismic design format.  The following  investigations will be conducted:    (a) Synthesize available information on seismic demands imposed by near-fault ground motions and pulse-type input on various types of structural systems,  (b) generate additional data on seismic demands to complement the  available information as needed for a comprehensive assessment of near-fault effects,  (c) draw conclusions on specific issues critical for performance based design, and  (d) utilize the acquired knowledge to combine near-fault effects  and performance based design.    The challenge of the research will be to provide effective  guidelines that will permit system concept development and  performance evaluation based on a description of the seismic  hazard for different return periods and a comprehensive set of  performance criteria, with due consideration given to the  characteristics of near-fault ground motions.    This is an award under the first round (FY'98) competition of the  CMS-INT initiative NSF 98-36 \"US-Japan Cooperative Research in  Urban Earthquake Disaster Mitigation\".  ***",
