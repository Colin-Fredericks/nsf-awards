 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Edwin S. Gould, Chemistry Department, Kent State University, is   supported in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program, for investigations of aqueous phase oxidation-reduction   reactions which emphasize less common oxidation states. Two areas will be   studied: 1) reductions with unipositive indium and 2) metal ion catalysis   of oxidations by peroxynitrite. In the first part of the study the   factors that determine when In(I) reacts by 1e and when it reacts by 2e   pathways will be defined. These data then will be used to determine which   ligating units will allow effective inner-sphere bridging in indium (I)   reactions and to learn how the reactivity of In(I) compares with that of   other 2e oxo-acceptor species. In the second part of the project, the   ability of transition metal catalysts to modify rates of the reactions of   the peroxynitrite ion will be evaluated. In particular, conversions with   both one and two electron reductants will be studied and problems   associated with maintaining effective concentrations of catalytic metal   centers in the high pH region necessary for the survival of peroxynitrite   will be addressed.  Reactions in which electrons are transferred between reactants are of   enormous importance in virtually all areas of pure and applied chemistry.   In this project the little studied indium +1 ion will be studied in order   to develop fundamental knowledge about its ability to provide one and two   electrons to chemical processes. This will provide background information   to facilitate the develoment of further applications for this species.   The peroxynitrite ion, the subject of the second part, is a powerful   oxidant and is formed in biological systems by the coupling of nitric   oxide and superoxide. Transformations of this ion with reductants are   complicated by the decomposition of peroxynitrite to nitrate and this   study will develop the behavior of this biologically ubiquitous and   unusually reactive peroxo species. In addition to the chemical studies,   an important goal of this project is the training of a cadre of chemists   with a strong background in inorganic solution chemistry. This is an area   of great importance, but one in which there are few young practitioners.",
