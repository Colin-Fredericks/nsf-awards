 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research involving the preparation, structural characterization, and   reactivities of carboxonium, sulfonium and hydrido onium ions such as   BH6+ and AlH6+  in superacid solutions will be continued.  Structures and   reactivities will be characterized by NMR spectroscopy, and where   possible, isolable ionic salts will be crystallized and X-ray crystal   structures determined.   Theoretical calculations will be carried out in   conjunction with the experimental work.  New ways will be attempted to   prepare simple but elusive carbocations - allyl, benzyl, cyclohexy, and   phenyl - as well as more complex polycations such as   2,4,6-trisubstituted-1,3,5-tribenzyl (benzene) trications, and   methanetetrakis(para-cumyl)tetrayl tetracation.   With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   is continuing support for Drs. George A. Olah and Golam Rasul in the   Department of Chemistry at the University of Southern California.  Dr.   Olah's Nobel Prize winning work on carbocations, or carbonium ions, was   based on his observation that these unstable organic species, which had   been proposed as reactive intermediates in organic reactions, could   actually be observed spectroscopically by NMR and their structures and   reactions studied in solution at low temperature, provided one had the   right solvents and Lewis acids.  These studies will provide a better   understanding of electrophilic reactivity in strong acids, and are   expected to lead to new synthetic methods in organic chemistry.  The work   will also provide valuable chemical research experience for postdoctoral   and graduate students.                                                   >\u2524 \u2563_\u2551\u255d?\u2514\u00c1\u2524 \u00a2`>\u00a5\u00a9\u00c1\u00a5\u2563\u2502   _\u00c1\u00a5\u00a9?\u2524\u00a2 \u00c2?\u255d \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u2551\u255d\u00c1\u2551/\u255d/\u00a5\u2563?> ?\u00c2 ?\u255d\u00c0/>\u2563\u2502 \u2502?_\u2551?\u2510>\u2524\u00a2   \u00bc\u00a9\u00c1 _\u00c1\u00a5\u00a9?\u2524??\u00c0`     \u2593/\u00a2\u00c1\u2524 ?> ?\u255d\u00c0/>?_\u00c1\u00a5/%%\u2563\u2502 \u255d\u00c1/\u00c0\u00c1>\u00a5\u00a2   \u00a9/\u00a2 \u2551?\u00a5\u00c1>\u00a5\u2563/% \u00c2?\u255d \u2510\u00a2\u00c1 \u2563> \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1   \u2551\u255d\u00c1\u2551/\u255d/\u00a5\u2563?> ?\u00c2 ?\u255d\u00c0/>\u2563\u2502 \u2502?_\u2551?\u2510>\u2524\u00a2 \u00a9/\u2514\u2563>\u00c0 \u2563>\u00a5\u00c1\u255d\u00c1\u00a2\u00a5\u2563>\u00c0 \u2593\u2563?%?\u00c0\u2563\u2502/%   \u2551\u255d?\u2551\u00c1\u255d\u00a5\u2563\u00c1\u00a2   \u00bf>  \u00a5\u00a9\u2563\u00a2 \u2534?\u255d,  \u00a2\u00a5\u2510\u2524\u00c1>\u00a5\u00a2 \u2534\u2563%% \u255d\u00c1\u2502\u00c1\u2563\u2514\u00c1 \u00a5\u255d/\u2563>\u2563>\u00c0 \u2510\u00a2\u00c1\u00c2\u2510% \u2563>   \u2524\u00c1\u2514\u00c1%",
