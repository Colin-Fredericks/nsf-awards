 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds an NSF-US/Europe Research Planning Workshop on  Personal Robotics, to be held in Toulouse, France, May 14 and 15,  1998.  The workshop will bring together leading researchers from  the US and Europe to examine a new center of convergence in  robotics research, centered on \"human in the loop\" problems.  The  meeting will undertake to identify the research needed to improve  the connectivity of people and computers to the real physical  world.  This presents new challenges and opportunities for the  emergence of robotics as a \"personal\" technology.  Personal  robotics applies to robots that can serve people directly in  professional, domestic, human-assistance, and public-oriented use,  and includes new and emerging concepts such as haptic interfaces,  telepresence, wearable and interface robotics that enrich and  support the connection of people to the world.  The results and  conclusions of the workshop will be presented at a panel session  the following week at the IEEE International Conference on  Robotics and Automation in Leuven, Belgium, and a report will  later be posted on the World Wide Web.",
