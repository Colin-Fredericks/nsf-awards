 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the design of highly mobile wireless  systems where not only end-users are mobile, but also the base  stations that serve these end-users are mobile. The mobility of  base stations introduces several challenging problems in the  design and development of such systems. In this project, highly  mobile wireless architectures with capability for intelligent  survivability and adaptive connectivity in an unpredictable  environments will be researched. Contributions will be made to the  foundation of intelligent highly mobile wireless network and  computing systems design, including network architecture, digital  information storage, intelligent distributed adaptive  reconfiguration, network routing, location management, channel  allocation, and information security. Intelligent agents capable  of taking autonomous decisions under uncertainty and approximate  knowledge, capable of adapting to changing operating conditions  (low bandwidth, changing topology and connectivity, and node  failures and mobility, etc.) will be researched. An architecture  and a set of relevant protocols will be designed and tested on a  simulation testbed. An extensive performance evaluation and  prediction will be conducted to evaluate, predict, and optimize  the performance of the developed architectures, protocols, and  algorithms.",
