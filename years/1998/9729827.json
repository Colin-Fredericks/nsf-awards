Paredis, Christian  Carnegie Mellon University     CISE Research Instrumenation:  Infrastructure for an Information-Based Manufacturing Testbed:  A Joint Initiative of Carnegie Mellon and Drexel University    This proposal initiates an education and research effort on   information-based manufacturing.  This collaborative effort between   Carnegie Mellon and Drexel Universities, along with numerous industrial   partners, will create a multi-university Information-based Manufacturing   Testbed consisting of pilot projects in the areas of    - Assembly Process Planning,  - Subcontractor Selection; and  - Engineering Design Repositories.    The CMU-Drexel Testbed will be used by researchers, students, and industry   participants to conduct exploratory research toward the reduction and   elimination of information bottlenecks in the manufacturing enterprise. The   fundamental research thrusts of the Testbed will include (1) to define and   test computing and network architectures to support information-based design   and manufacturing services; (2) to deploy prototype services for assembly,   process selection, design-for-manufacture, and artifact fabrication; and (3)   to create novel methods for search, retrieval and tracking of engineering   data as it is acted upon by teams of people and software agents. The final   results will be open to the public---creating an online forum for providing   many with a means to become familiar with the latest information technology   for engineering.",
