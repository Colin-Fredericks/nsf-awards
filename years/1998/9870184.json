 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870184  Mares      A 12-month survey of the birds and mammals of the Andean and pre-Andean provinces (Jujuy, Salta, Tucum n, and northern Catamarca) of northwestern Argentina will be conducted. The conservation status of the region has been defined as \"Vulnerable,\" its biological distinctiveness as \"Regionally Outstanding,\" and it has been assigned a Biodiversity Priority Status of Level 1 (Highest Priority at Regional Scale). This biogeographically significant region remains largely unexplored biologically. Several of South America's major habitats occur here, including the Yungas forest, puna, prepuna, montane grasslands, chaco, montane chaco, and Monte desert. Microhabitat diversity is high, and numerous isolated valleys and montane islands exist. The area is a corridor for the north-south migration of biota, and has been suggested as a center of diversity for many taxa. The entire region is an ideal area for geographic isolation and subsequent speciation.   Birds and mammals will be surveyed at ~20 localities. Specimens, including genetic data, will be collected and deposited in museum collections. Data on habitat use, habits, molting, reproduction, and natural history will be recorded. Faunal surveys, checklists, and identification keys will be produced both in print and electronic format. Research will involve descriptions of new genera and species, leading to research on systematic and phylogenetic relationships, biogeography, and conservation. Data will aid in choosing sites for preservation and will be baseline data on habitat selection, reproduction, and species composition for major habitats in this threatened region. Collaboration will involve individuals from six organizations in the United States, Argentina, and Canada. Argentine and US students will be supported and trained both in the field and in the laboratory.",
