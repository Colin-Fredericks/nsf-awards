 "awd_abstract_narration": "9871085\r\nXiong\r\nUsing funding from the Major Research Instrumentation program, researchers at Florida State University (FSU) will develop an apparatus for low temperature thin film growth that will be incorporated in a unique dilution refrigeration system with a base temperature of 20 mK.  With this apparatus the PIs will be capable of growing one dimensional nanostructures and thin films under ultrahigh vacuum conditions and performing in situ low temperature electrical characterization on them.  When used in conjunction with nano-scale stencil masks, the cross-sectional area of a low dimensional sample can be varied, tuning it through the insulator-superconductor (or \"metal\") transition and probing the phase transition down to 20 mK without undergoing sample change or thermal cycling.  The centerpiece of the setup is a commercially available dilution refrigerator, which will be customized to accommodate the necessary accessories for the film growth.  Such a system will facilitate studies of quantum phase transition, quantum fluctuations and interference effect under restricted dimensions with previously unattainable flexibility and reliability.  \r\n%%%\r\nThe unique combination of in situ thin film growth and low temperature electrical measurement will open the door for many research opportunities in the long run, as the apparatus will be sited at MARTECH, the Center for Materials Research and Technology, which is funded by the state of Florida and located at FSU.  The setup will provide researchers at FSU and surrounding institutions, especially Florida A & M University, with convenient access to ultralow temperature for more routine low temperature measurements such as tunneling and magneto-transport studies.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
