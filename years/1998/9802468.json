 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802468  Huse    This award involves research in condensed matter theory.  Huse plans to study:  critical points with quenched disorder, the Josephson  plasmon in layered superconductors, kinetics and phase  transitions in superconducting wire arrays, frustrated  magnets and hard sphere crystals.   The scaling properties of the distributions of quantities  at and near the critical points of systems with quenched  disorder will be investigated.  One focus is to determine  whether the very different scaling of the average and median  behavior that is seen in some one-dimensional models can  occur in two- or three-dimensional systems.  We will attempt  to develop a scaling theory for such systems, and will  investigate what aspects of the distributions can be seen by  different sorts of experiments.  The frequency and linewidth of the Josephson plasmon in  layered superconductors will be studied as a unique probe of  interlayer superconducting correlations, which vary strongly  with temperature and applied magnetic field.  The  inhomogeneous broadening of this mode by quenched disorder  and quasi-static thermal disorder in both the vortex liquid  and glass regimes of the phase diagram will be studied.  The conditions under which equilibrium can be achieved in  exotic superconducting phases of  Kagome lattice  superconducting wire arrays will be studied.  %%%  This award involves research at the cutting edge of  condensed matter theory. Huse will focus his study in three  areas: (1) phase transitions in disordered materials, (2)  charge oscillations in layered superconductors such as the  high temperature superconductors, and  (3) superconducting  phases in novel superconducting networks.  Studies in these  areas seek to resolve fundamental issues at the forefront of  condensed matter physics.  ***",
