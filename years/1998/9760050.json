 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9760050  Witteles    The Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will develop a mixed oxide and/or superlattice of iron/chromiun/zinc/copper as a selective catalyst for destruction of NOx, in offgas of high temperature combustion processes: MLLW, power plants, factories, automotive vehicles.  This improved catalyst will replace more expensive, less efficient vanadia/titania catalysts used for stationary applications and less durable, less effective zeolitic-copper catalysts used in automotive vehicles.  Such a catalyst, imported by DOE from the Former Soviet Union, evaluated for destruction of the offgas NOx in the Plasma Arc Process in MLLW, was shown to be more effective than vanadia/titania.  We will improve the reduction properties and efficiency of the catalyst by introducing a novel deposition process for the mixed oxides through use of our proprietary WIT-TIFIDTM deposition process and its superior properties.  In addition we will investigate the feasibility of replacing the mixed oxides with a superlattice structure of the oxides for a more homogeneous/uniform coating.  'Me advantages/disadvantages of the two structures will be evaluated.  During Phase II mixed oxides and/or superiattice catalysts will be produced and a laboratory bench test will be tested and evaluated.  During Phase III we will test our catalysts in MLLW, power plants and automotive vehicles.    The accomplishment of the goals set in this program will advance the efforts on behalf of environmental management of mixed low level waste sites (MLLW), stationary pollutants (power plants and factories) and mobile pollutants (automotive vehicles), by providing for a more effective, more durable, less expensive selective reduction catalyst for the destruction of oxides of nitrogen, an objectionable pollutant produced in high temperature combustion processes in the above mentioned industries.  ***",
