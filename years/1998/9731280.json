 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the determinants of education and work mobility among second-generation Mexican-Americans in New York City.  The fate of the children of immigrants, the \"second generation,\" is an increasingly important scholarly and public policy topic. This research will contribute to our understanding of the fate of the second generation through an ethnographic and interview study that considers the effects of gender, market niche, ethnic identity and social organization on their educational and occupational mobility patterns.     This study is based on earlier ethnographic research on immigrants from the Mexican town of Ticuani, and the present project will seek to understand several puzzling ethnographic findings, including: Why would second generation Ticuanense women be more likely to be upwardly mobile in the mainstream economy and to attend college and obtain professional jobs, while the men are more likely to leave school and be upwardly mobile in the \"immigrant economy\"? What accounts for the upward mobility of a significant minority of second generation Ticuanense men and women, and the stagnation or even downward mobility of the rest? Why do some second generation Mexican-Americans view ethnic and racial discrimination as not stopping them from achieving in school or work, view themselves more as \"second generation ethnics\" and identify more with \"ethnic\" immigrants (like Greeks or Italians), while others see discrimination as precluding their mobility, view themselves as \"native racial minorities\" and identify more with Blacks and Puerto Ricans.  What relationship, if any, do their views of discrimination have to their occupational and educational mobility?      This project is supported under the Research in Undergraduate Institutions program.  It fulfills the RUI aims to support high quality research by faculty with active involvement of undergraduate students, strengthen the research environment in academic departments that are oriented primarily toward undergraduate instructi on, and promote the integration  of research and education at predominantly undergraduate institutions.  The study will also contribute to our understanding of the second generation of immigrants and of educational and occupational mobility",
