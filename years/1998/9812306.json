Such switching of partners occurs in many organisms, yet few data are available from natural populations of non-human animals on the transmission of pathogens or the consequences of being exposed. This project explores the prevalence, the frequency of transmission, and the possible consequences of bacteria in the semen of male red-winged blackbirds, a species in which females mate-switch frequently. Male and female blackbirds will be surveyed for bacteria, similarities between mates documented, and an experiment designed to identify sexual transmission performed. Reproductive success and survival of tested individuals will be tracked in the field, and bacterial isolates will be tested in the laboratory for functions potentially affecting host fitness.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work is the first to study the possible sexual transmission of disease in a natural population of birds. Several previously untested hypotheses about the importance of sexually-transmitted diseases will be evaluated. The results will be important in understanding the selective forces shaping reproductive behavior and the evolutionary relationships between disease-causing organisms and host behaviors. This work has broad implications for theories regarding the evolution of mating systems. In addition it may provide important information concerning disease transmission in natural populations with relevance for conservation of songbirds and other species.\r\n",
