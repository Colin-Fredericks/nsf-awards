 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry at Clemson   University  to upgrade a rotating anode-based X-ray diffraction analysis   system by replacement of the serial detector with a CCD area detector.      The equipment will enhance research in a number of areas such as the   following: (1) the chemistry of fluoropolymer superacids which have   important applications in fuel cell membranes, (2) the synthesis and   characterization of complex metal sulfides , (3) the preparation of metal   oxides, nitrides, and sulfides in novel media such as geothermal brine.    The instrumentation will also be used in the teaching of X-ray   crystallography techniques to a large number of students. \r\n\r\nCCD detectors   allow large sections of the X-ray diffraction pattern of a crystal to be   measured at once and provide a powerful tool for the study of very small   and weakly diffracting materials.  Such systems are especially useful in   applications related to materials chemistry.",
