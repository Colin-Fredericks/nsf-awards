 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support Drs. Stephen Kowalewski, Andrew Balkansky and their collaborators will conduct an archaeological survey of an 800 km. square region of mostly mountainous terrain in the Mixteca Alta highlands in the state of Oaxaca Mexico. Prior research indicates that the region has been continuously occupied since at least 1,300 BC and thus documents the rise of Central Mexican states and their expansion in the Postclassic period. While today the region is eroded and poor, the Spanish conquerors in the sixteenth century described the Mixteca Alta as a well-populated, rich and prosperous land. Oaxaca was a focal area throughout much of Middle American prehistory. Monte Alban emerged as one of the major prehistoric states and at ca. 1,000 AD developed into a Mixtec Kingdom whose influence extended well beyond Oaxaca. However, at the same time smaller apparently semi-independent centers of power existed within this region and archaeologists wish to understand the complicated relationships and changing balances between centralized authority and smaller partially autonomous regions. Researchers have come to realize that to gain insight into the organization of technologically simple prehistoric states and empires it is necessary to adopt a very broad regional approach and set individual major sites within this broader framework. Dr. Kowalewski's research is directed towards this goal.  The team will conduct a systematic foot survey over 100% of the habitable area in the Achiutla region. Two person teams will walk systematically over all ridge crests and larger stream bottoms. All archaeological materials and features such as buildings and terraces will be noted and mapped. Surface materials, which consist largely of ceramics, will be collected. Because design styles change over time, pottery provides a sensitive time indicator and through its use it will be possible to plot changing site location and population density and distribution over time. These data will then be interpreted in an environmental context.  The Achiutla study will fill an important survey gap in Oaxaca. When the project is completed, archaeologists will have information on a ca 140 km. contiguous area and this provides a unique opportunity which allows detailed examination of human behavior at a large regional scale. The work has the potential to provide a unique insight into how Mesoamerican states and empires developed and were maintained.",
