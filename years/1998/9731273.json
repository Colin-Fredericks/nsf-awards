 "awd_abstract_narration": "An error bound for a problem is a bound on the distance from any  point to the solution set by some error function evaluated at  that point.  There recently has been active interest in using  error bounds to design and analyze solution methods for  optimization and complementarity and variational inequality  problems.  One focus of this project is a continued study of this  subject, but in new directions.  In particular, the following  problems are being studied: (i) error bounds for perturbations  of linear/nonlinear programs and complementarity problems, (ii)  the use of error bound to implicitly identify active sets and  obtain local superlinear convergence of methods under weaker  assumptions  than those existing, (iii) error  bounds and their use in estimating the convergence ratio of Gauss-  Seidel and Jacobi methods for infinite-dimensional convex  minimization.    A second focus of the project is the design and the analysis of  solution methods for  complementarity and related problems.  In  particular, these problems are being studied: (iv)  branch-and-  bound strategies for globalizing local methods for  complementarity problems, (v) extension of  interior path-  following and non-interior methods and merit functions for  complementarity problems  to the semi-definite setting, i.e., in  the space of symmetric real matrices.    A third focus of the project is (vi) the development of epsilon-  relaxation methods for  multicommodity network flow problems  and, more generally, linearly constrained minimization  problems  with separable convex costs.  Computational study of the above  methods is being conducted.",
