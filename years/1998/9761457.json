The research proposed herein addresses a critical need for high low cost and rapid diagnostics for pathogenic bacterial contaminants associated with food home enteric infections. The main goal of the proposed effort is to exploit the superior sensitivity of BioTraces' Multi Photon Detection (MPDTM) technology to develop an integrated test system for use in process diagnostics and monitoring in the food processing industry.  This test system will be based upon the complementary techniques of MPD-enhanced quantitative PCR and MPD-enabled direct detection of DNA. We will utilize MPD's 10,000-fold sensitivity advantage over current instrumentation and BioTraces' experience in developing ultra-sensitivity assay protocols to significantly decrease assay tumaround times and improve specificity by minimizing non-specific biological backgrounds.  Our objective is to develop tests which are sensitive to less than 10 pathogenic bacteria per sample with turnaround times of less than one hour.    The potential market for very rapid (< 30 minutes), high sensitivity (< 10 CFU/ml) assays for food-bome pathogens are expected to account for about 20% of the total food quality testing market, which is currently estimated to be about $5 billion/year worldwide.  More generally, the quantitative PCR and DNA direct detection methods to be developed herein will find significant applications in life science research and clinical diagnostics.  ***",
