Such materials exhibit  novel properties  due  to their geometry, the interplay  between constituent materials,  and the  degrees of freedom  in their fabrication. The multilayer work will  address  key  questions  in ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic  (FM/AF)exchange coupling   and    magnetic/superconducting  multilayers.  Thus, the materials fabrication work  will  address the question of whether FM/AF coupling can be  established between transition  metal and rare earth  moments. A further topic  to  be investigated  in  detail is  the spatial variation  of  the  FM/AF coupling  as the  individual layers in the multilayer  arrays  are traversed.  The  magnetic/superconducting  multilayers  employing  ferromagnetic   and  antiferromagnetic  constituents   offer  an excellent  opportunity to investigate the pair-breaking  mechanism arising  in antiferromagnetic/superconducting  planer interfaces, and superconducting ground state  properties expressed in junction interfaces.  Novel  fabrication techniques have been developed  to produce  bismuth nanowire arrays that have been found to  exhibit  very  large  magnetoresistance. The origins of this  and  related electrical  transport  properties  remain  obscure  and  will  be further investigated. The research involves  graduate students  in a  range  of  fundamental projects  that also have  potential  for major  impact on  technological areas such as information  storage technology  and the microelectronics industry.  %%%  This project deals with artificially structured materials  such as quasi  two-dimensional  multilayers and one-  dimensional  nanowire arrays.  Such  materials exhibit novel  properties  due  to  their geometry,  the interplay between  constituent materials,  and  the degrees of freedom in their  fabrication. These materials  are  of interest  from  fundamental   viewpoints,  but  additionally  have important  technological applications in magnetic recording  readheads,  wide-range  magnetic  field sensing  devises,  and  field  emitters  for  flat  panel  displays.  The  magnetic  interaction between  multilayers  leads  to a phenomenon  known  as  exchange biasing.  This  exchange  biasing is at  the  heart  of  the  new generation of high performance  magnetic recording heads.  Several key  questions  in the  nature and mechanism of exchange  biasing, and  materials  synthesis aspects of exchange  biasing,  will  be explored.  Nanowire  arrays of bismuth will  be  investigated  to  understand  origins  of magnetoresistance in  this  semi-  metallic material.  The  arrays  show promise for  applications  for  field sensing devices. The mechanism of  the large magnetoresistance  is poorly  understood  and the  influence of fabrication  methods  on this transport  property will be systematically investigated.  The research  involves  graduate students in a range  of  fundamental  projects that   also  have  potential  for  major   impact  on technological  areas such as information storage  technology  and the microelectronics industry.  ***",
