 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733230  Wang    This  is a CAREER Award which combines research and education  in  semiconductor  quantum optics. The research program  will  extend  cavity  quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies into the domain  of  semiconductors by developing a novel approach based on  composite  semiconductor-microsphere  systems that  can  take  advantage  of  extreme  three dimensional photonic confinement in  a  dielectric  microsphere. Dynamics and radiative processes in the systems will  also be investigated by using various techniques of time-resolved  photoluminescence.  The  objective is to understand  how  radical  modifications  in  vacuum  fluctuations  can  change  fundamental  spontaneous  emission processed in semiconductors. The  education  program   includes   developing   a   university-wide   photonics  curriculum  and  initiating  an  industrial  internship   program  affiliated  with the Oregon Center for Optics to  better  prepare  students for growing job markets in photonics-related industries.  The  education  program  also includes creating  a  new  graduate  course  on  semiconductor quantum optics to bring  down  barriers  between quantum optics and condensed matter physics.  %%%  This   CAREER  Award  combines  research  and  education   in   a  technologically  important  area  of  optics  and   semiconductor  physics.  The  research  program centers on  fundamental  optical  processes in a novel semiconductor optical devices where the size  of the optical resonator approaches the optical wavelength. These  studies  should  improve our understanding of physical  behaviors  and  limit of devices such as micro-lasers and may also  lead  to  new  concepts for devices such as ultralow threshold lasers.  The  education  program includes developing an undergraduate photonics  curriculum to make photonics education accessible to students  in  other disciplines and initiating an industrial internship program  to  better prepare students for growing job markets in photonics-  related ind ustries.  ***",
