 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732908  Saadatmanesh  During the past decade, an increasing level of attention has  been paid to fiber reinforced polymer composites as an  alternative construction materials.  Several studies by  various researchers in this area have indicated that one of  the most promising applications of fiber composites in  construction is in the area of structural repair and  retrofit.  In particular, research in this field has  indicated that epoxy bonded fiber composite sheets and  laminates can be used to externally reinforce a variety of  civil engineering type structures for seismic and nonseismic  forces.  The recent NSF workshop on research needs in the  area of composites for construction, clearly attests to the  promise of this technology and to the need for an effective  and coordinated research plan.    This project addresses the long-term durability of the bond  at the interface of composite/concrete and composite/steel.  A large number of short term studies have indicated the  effectiveness of fiber composites for strengthening of  structures, however, very few, if any at all, have addressed  the bond and interface behavior, in particular, the long-  term durability of the bond.  The successful application of  this technology requires a fundamental understanding of the  long-term bond behavior.  A comprehensive, accelerated aging  test program will be developed to investigate the bond under  various aggressive environmental conditions simulated by  special chemical solutions.   Analytical models based on  diffusion theories will be developed to predict the rate of  diffusion of aggressive elements into the composite and the  bond.   Fick's law will be adopted to predict the moisture  profile, and aggressive elements diffusion into the  composite and the bondline.  Peck's relationship will be  utilized to estimate the life of the bond.  ***",
