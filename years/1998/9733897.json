 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of humans to analyze, capture, and recall visual  information significantly outperforms their ability to  analyze and recall other types of sensory information. This  fact makes humans rely heavily on their visual sense for  extracting information and learning about their surrounding,  and for planning and executing purposeful acts. As a result,  the need to reliably process and transmit visual data has  become central to many applications. In particular, with the  rapid development and migration of end-user applications and  services towards transmission media which place high  constraints on bandwidth, such as the Internet and wireless  media, there is a growing need for the development of new  efficient image and video compression techniques, which  offer reduction in bit-rates and improvement in quality at  low bit-rates. Although the importance of exploiting human  perception has long been recognized within the signal and  image processing community, the previous research efforts in  image and video compression have concentrated on developing  methods to minimize not perceptual but rather mathematically  tractable, easy to measure, distortion criteria. While non-  perceptual distortion measures were found to be reasonably  reliable for higher bit-rates (high quality applications),  they do not correlate well with the perceived quality at  lower bit-rates and they fail to guarantee preservation of  important perceptual qualities in the reconstructed images  despite the potential for a good signal-to-noise ratio  (SNR). Our research interest is in developing adaptive  perceptual-based image and video coding systems, which  discriminate between signal components based on their  perceptual relevance for achieving robustness and increased  performance in terms of quality and bit-rate. Achieving this  objective requires having reliable tools for predicting the  sensitivity of the human visual system to distortions. The  main objectives of this research can be summarized as  follows: 1 . Investigate the spatio-temporal masking  properties of the human visual system, and develop reliable  techniques to adaptively measure the masking characteristics  and perceptual relevancy of the different components  contained in the visual source material.2. Derive a reliable  tractable perceptual distortion metric for assessing visual  quality at a local or global level.  3. Investigate adaptive quantizer designs based on the  derived perceptual distortion metric.4. Develop and  investigate robust perceptually-based lossless and lossy  image and video coding techniques, with emphasis on  audiovisual applications disseminated through highly  constrained-bandwith communication systems. The research  program is complemented by the education plan, in which a  Signal and Image Processing Outreach Program is being  developed to stimulate the interest of middle and high  school students and undergraduates in engineering and  science. Another main component of the educational plan is  to integrate the research part into the educational process  by incorporating some of the research activities in  undergraduate and graduate courses as well as in  undergraduate-oriented research projects, and by introducing  new courses related to the research effort. Another goal is  to research efficient ways to make use of technology in  education.",
