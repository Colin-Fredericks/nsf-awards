 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this ILI proposal is to offer new laboratory exercises that utilize state of the art  technology in four upper level undergraduate courses: Endocrinology, Neuroanatomy,  Neurophysiology and Parasitology. Students play an active role in incorporating this technology into practical and experiential learning and thus are better prepared for careers in science. The proposed laboratories are based on three pedagogical principles: student-designed inquiry, collaboration among learners and use of new technology. Students test hypotheses, conduct experiments, collect and analyze their data and present their results in written and/or oral reports to their class and to lower-level students in workshops. Thus other undergraduates  also benefit from this project. Literature review and assimilation is a critical aspect of these laboratory exercises and reports. With these innovations in our courses, students are experiencing real science as it is performed by research scientists.  All of these courses, except Parasitology, are included in the interdisciplinary Neuroscience Minor, jointly offered with the Department of Psychology. Approximately 100 students enroll in these courses each year. Most of these students continue their education in post-baccalaureate programs across the nation, such as medical veterinary, dental, physical therapy and Ph.D. programs.  The results and impact of this project will be assessed by formative and summate evaluations conducted in collaboration with an evaluation coordinator. Results will be shared with colleagues through publications in education journals, presentations at professional meetings and the Miami University website.",
