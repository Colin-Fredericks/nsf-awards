 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will test key hypotheses and expand the scope of Cooperation Theory. This theory explains how cooperation and conflict emerge between two or more social units when there is no outside agent enforcing transaction rules. Although analyzed via game theory and computer simulations, few of the theory's propositions have been tested against data in natural settings. This research will use historical data from journals describing the first encounters of European explorers, traders, conquerors, and missionaries with indigenous peoples all over the world, during the 15th to 19th centuries. Some 20 Pacific Ocean voyages from a 280 volume historical collection will be content-analyzed for transaction sequences including such behaviors as trade, theft, aggression, and sanctioning. Many hypotheses can be tested with a before-after design when attributes and explanatory variables change in the course of an encounter or during the life of an expedition. By examining test cases for cooperation theory from natural historical settings, the generality of the theory will be enhanced, as will its applicability to issues of conflict and cooperation among contemporary groups in modern society. \r\n",
