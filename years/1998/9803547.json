 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803547\r\nHorn\r\n\r\nQuestions addressed in this proposal include, firstly, the uniform stability \r\nof an anisotropic system of elasticity.  Recent results by Alabau and \r\nKomornik have shown that such a system is uniformly stable if the domain \r\nis a sphere.  If the system is isotropic, the PI has obtained uniform stability \r\nfor more general domains.  Thus, the goal is to obtain the best of both:  \r\nUniform stability of an anisotropic system on a more general domain. \r\nTechniques involved in the proof include sharp traces regularity estimates, \r\nobtained through the use of microlocal analysis.  Of particular interest is \r\nthe need for unique continuation for the anisotropic system.  Secondly, \r\nexact controllability results even under the assumption that the system is \r\nisotropic are problematic. While a few results exist, in most cases the \r\nproofs are not accessible beyond a specialized audience or the geometric \r\nrestrictions are extremely stringent.  An approach based on the use of \r\nCarleman type estimates, which allow higher order coupling terms to be \r\nconsidered, is considered for both Dirichlet or Neumann boundary \r\nconditions.  Finally, further applications of sharp trace regularity results \r\nare seen in the case of cylindrical shells.  A particular question of interest \r\nis whether the stability properties are robust with respect to the thickness \r\nof the shell.\r\n\r\nExact controllability, i.e., the ability to drive a system to a desired state, is \r\nan important question arising in engineering. Random or uncontrolled \r\nvibrations which may occur can lead to serious consequences.  From \r\nwitnesses to the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge to a businessman \r\nbothered by distortion on his cellular phone, almost everyone has \r\nexperienced the effects of a lack of control.  If a system is uniformly \r\nstable, any undesired vibrations can be damped out through an appropriate \r\nchoice of input, e.g., through a direct force or torque along the boundary \r\nof the object.  Investigations in this project focus on the theoretical aspects \r\nof control when an elastic body is assumed to be composed of more than \r\none material or is nonuniform.\r\n",
