 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870405  Jones  Selection by pollinators has long beeb thought to drive the evolution of showy floral characters, but the action of pollinator-mediated selection has proven difficult to demonstrate in the field. Pollinators have been shown to influence components of plant reproductive success and mating pattern. However, how pollinator selection translates into changes in gene frequencies in polymorphic plant populations remains a major challenge. The primary objective of this POWRE-funded research is to test whether selection by pollinators can be sufficient to drive the evolution of a floral character in experimental plant populations. The feasibility of this study is enhanced by the use of a particularly appropriate plant-pollinator system. A single gene, sulfurea, determines flower color in snapdragons. Bumblebee pollinators have been shown to relate this color polymorphism to nectar rewards. By manipulating nectar rewards and thus pollinator behavior, replicate experimental plant populations will be subjected to selection of varying strength by realistic selection agents over many generations. With this model system, fundamental questions about the evolution of floral traits will be addressed directly. In this research, a reliable method of determining plant genotypes will be developed using closely linked polymorphic DNA markers. Also, the fertility selection model used to generate predictions for microevolution will be explored to guide the collection of pollinator behavior data in the experimental populations. This research will bring important tools from molecular genetics and computer modeling to bear on a unique investigation in the evolutionary biology of plant-pollinator systems.",
