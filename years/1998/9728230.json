 "awd_abstract_narration": "Milkman  9728230       The intent of this project is to relate several molecular and population properties to the diversity and evolution of the E. coli species genome.  Evidence is increasing that a high proportion of the E. coli genome consists of genes imported over tens of millions of years from phylogenetically distant (but physically close) sources. Since the genome size must be limited, some existing genes must be eliminated from each chromosome -- but not necessarily the same genes from every chromosome. For each gene added relatively quickly to the species, 100 genes (for example) might decline in frequency by 1%. This would lead to abundant presence/absence variation (in addition to allelic variation, already well known). The complete E. coli strain MG1655 DNA sequence has revealed many genes whose specific function is not known. Some (not all) of these may have reduced value and disappear from individual lines without leaving the species altogether. In a diverse set of strains, PCR and Southern hybridization will test for presence/absence polymorphism. Now in the two hypervariable regions, replacements are selected which carry novel variants (O-antigens or restriction-modification systems) until they are no longer rare. This results in a downward gradient of replacement rates outward from the selected common anchor point, since replacements vary in length. Using 11 strains relatively recently diverged from a common ancestor, a place near the well-defined hypervariable rfb region is chosen in which each individual strain acquires, during the period since divergence, about one distinct replacement from more distant strains. Sequencing defines the end of the replacement. Finally, since bacterial chromosomes are dividing progressively though the entire cell cycle, fragments of incoming DNA can be incorporated into one or another nascent chromosome and detected by the restriction analysis of PCR fragments amplified from segregating daughter colonies identified by standard markers.     This  project exploits the completion of one E. coli genome, which defines in ultimate detail the entire genetic content of a representative member of the species. As a biological species cannot be described fully without a complete organism, a species genome cannot be fully described from a fragmentary set of  genes. Now, given the available analytic tools, including biochemical methods and population genetic theory, the structural diversity (DNA sequence variation, including presence/absence), mechanisms of change (transfer of DNA to an E. coli cell from a different member of the species or from outside the species; production of several variant types after a single transfer; various forms of natural selection), and the dynamics of change (rates of DNA transfer as a function of chromosomal region , clonal sweeps -- the multiplication and spread of genome-wide clones, as well as smaller regions of the chromosome) can be  considered and addressed experimentally. This leads to a clearer understanding of the specific genetic properties of various sorts of E. coli as well as the genetic properties common to the entire species. Many of the results should be applicable to higher organisms.",
