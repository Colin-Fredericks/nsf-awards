 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the Community Colleges for Innovative Technology Transfer, Inc. (CCITT), Foothill College is planning and holding eight regional summer workshops during two consecutive years for faculty from community colleges and senior institutions. The workshops are providing faculty with training in four technologies: remote sensing/image processing (RS/IP) and geographic information systems/geographic positioning systems (GIS/GPS). The project is serving approximately 180 individual faculty over the course of the project.     The project's objectives are as follows:      To train undergraduate faculty in the use of RS/IP and GIS/GPS using curriculum modules developed by CCITT.      To develop additional curriculum modules integrating the four technologies into each participant's instructional area.      To instruct faculty in the use of the Internet and its resources in developing curriculum using the four technologies.      To develop an awareness of leading edge ideas and applications that are reshaping the disciplines through these technologies.      To adapt and disseminate the curriculum modules developed by the undergraduate faculty participants on the national, regional and local level.      To increase the level of communication and cooperation among participants while developing curricula at their home institutions.",
