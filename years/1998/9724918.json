 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724918  Ram    This Americas Program award will fund a collaborative  research study on the physiology of reproduction in  molluscs, between Dr. Jeffrey Ram, Wayne State University,  and Dr. Carlos S. Gallardo, Universidad Austral de Chile.  The aim of the project is to understand the functional  evolution of peptide hormones using snail egg-laying  hormone(s) (EHL) as a model system, and to develop  techniques for the use of the (ELH) in prosobranch snail  aquaculture.  The researchers have chosen the CH giganteus  species of molluscs for conducting experiments directed at  achieving three major objectives: determining the location  of ELH-imunoreactive (ELH-IR) neurons and fibers in the  nervous system, identifying and purifying egg-laying  hormone(s) in their nervous system by bioassay, with the  eventual goal of determining its sequence.  The proposed  project is expected to achieve both scientific and practical  results .  It will result in an increased understanding of  the functional evolution of peptide hormone, and in the  development of techniques for using egg-laying hormones in  prosobranch snail aquaculture   In the long term, results of  this study will be used in future studies on mechanisms  underlying regulation of electrophysiological activity in  neurosecretory cells.    The prosobranch gastropod molluscs form the basis of several  important fisheries in both US and Chile.  An increased  knowledge of the mechanisms controlling their reproduction,  to be used at desired intervals, under controlled laboratory  conditions, will help the development of mariculture. The  two researchers are among the leading experts in their  respective fields, and both will benefit by this  collaboration. Dr. Ram will identify new experimental  preparations for basic science investigations of peptide  hormone and neurosecretory cell evolution and function, and  Dr. Gallardo will benefit by obtaining the expertise and  experience of the US PI in hormonal regulation of  reproduction of molluscs.  B oth countries will benefit by  the practical application of molluscan endocrinology to  aquaculture and basic science research.    ***",
