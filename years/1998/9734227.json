 "awd_abstract_narration": "New materials have been introduced to the construction industry for the repair and strengthening of the deteriorating infrastructure system.  One area of particular interest has been the use of Fiber-Reinforced Polymers (FRP) to repair and strengthen concrete and masonry structures.  Unfortunately, there is very little long-term field experience or basic research to indicate that FRP materials used in combination with concrete and masonry will withstand the elements as expected.  The effectiveness of the FRP system relies completely on the bond between the substrate and fabric.  Concrete and masonry are porous systems that typically exchange free moisture with the environment.   This natural free moisture movement can be interrupted by the application of an FRP system.  Another concern is the application of repair systems to the surface of corrosion damaged concrete with no thought as to the effect on the corrosion process that exist in the element.  There is a need for training in basic corrosion science and durability of civil engineering structures that is not addressed in undergraduate or graduate programs.  A new course will be created at the University of Wyoming from Career support to provide training to students in durability of structures.  With funding from the Career award and using the data gathered from research, develop an FRP repair/strengthening seminar series.  The short course has the added benefit of providing technology transfer of the findings to the engineering community for comment and use.",
