 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports metalloenzyme research by Drs. Harry B. Gray and John H.   Richards of the Beckman Institute, California Institute of Technology.    The goal of the work is to develop a new method for probing the   properties and reactivities of redox metalloenzymes.  The prototypical   heme oxygenase, cytochrome P450, will be the main system studied.  This   enzyme stereospecifically hydroxlates hydrocarbons using dioxygen as the   oxidant.  In many metalloenzymes, rate-limiting electron transfer (ET)   steps preclude observation of other critical activation steps.  To attack   this problem, natural redox partners will be replaced with new reagents   that are able to exchange electrons at much faster rates.    Laser-initiated electron transfer reactions will be used to drive   enzymatic reactions.  In order to deliver the laser-generated redox   equivalents, a direct covalent or hydrogen-bonded pathway has been shown   to be essential.  Here a direct link between a redox sensitizer and the   enzyme active site will be formed by taking advantage of the affinity of   the enzyme for its active site.  Ruthenium-diimine sensitizers will be   covalently tethered to cytochrome P450 substrates to provide a conduit   for delivering oxiding and reducing equivalents to the heme cofactor.    The initial goal is to prepare and characterize the oxo-iron (ferryl)   intermediates that have been suggested as the active hydroxylating   agents.  Enzyme for this work will be expressed in E. coli, and   site-directed mutagenesis will be employed to study the importance of   specific residues in ferryl-formation reactions.  The reactive   intermediates will be studied using a variety of photochemical methods.   Metalloenzymes catalyze many reactions involving small-molecule   activation.  For example, enzymes promote reduction of oxygen gas to   water, reduction of nitrogen gas to ammonia, and use oxygen gas to add   oxygen atoms to carbon chains.  These reactions are important not only   biologically but also commercially.  This research aims at understanding   the enzyme that promotes addition of oxygen to hydrocarbons by oxygen   gas.  The reactive enzyme intermediate has never been observed, so a   stategy for replacing the reagents from the natural system with ones that   can react more readily will be used to enable photochemical observation   of reactions at the active site.",
