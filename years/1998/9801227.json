 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hastings  9801227       The investigator and his colleagues organize an  interdisciplinary conference to bring together biologists and  mathematicians to discuss wave phenomena from their varying  perspectives.  The conference aims to give both biologists and  mathematicians insights into the types of models that can be used  for wave phenomena and the parameter ranges where such behavior  can be expected.  To this end, the conference includes both  general lectures and more technical talks where particular  techniques are explored more fully.  Of special interest in  techniques are continuation methods in models of long range  interaction, where integral equation models are involved.       One-dimensional traveling waves have long been of interest  to biologists, particularly in neurobiology where they describe  the propopagation of electrical signals down a nerve axon or as a  plane wave across a two-dimensional collection of electrically  active cells.  Related phenomena include spiral and other  patterns, such as those thought to be responsible for some  pathogenic behavior in cardiac tissue.  Similar patterns in the  brain are of current interest as well.  Such behavior is not  limited to neurobiology, and appears in a wide variety of  chemical and biological systems, such as the Belousov-Zhabotinsky  reaction, slime molds, and many others.  On the other hand,  mathematicians have studied basic questions about waves for a  variety of models, including biological and chemical settings.  One focus of mathematical work has been to prove the existence  and stability of traveling waves.  In this regard continuation  methods have become particularly interesting in models of long  range interaction, where integral equations are involved.  The  conference brings together biologists and mathematicians to  discuss wave phenomena from their different perspectives.  The  meeting fosters interactions between the two areas that should  lead to greater understanding of a variety of phenomena important  in  biology.",
