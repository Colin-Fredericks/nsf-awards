Such objects are rigorous constructions of nontrivial  topological quantum field theories.  In the case of the moduli space of   curves, the corresponding representations are cohomological field theories  (in the sense of Kontsevich and Manin), the most dramatic examples of which  arise from Gromov-Witten invariants of a smooth projective variety.  The  investigator will study properties of canonical families of such structures  arising from the geometry of these moduli spaces, using techniques borrowed  from homotopy theory (operads), algebraic geometry (moduli spaces), and  quantum field theory (Feynman diagrams).       Recently, much of the interaction between mathematics and theoretical  physics has revolved about topological quantum field theories, quantum field  theories whose observables correspond to topological invariants.  A rigorous  construction of a nontrivial class of such theories is now possible through  the study of Gromov-Witten invariants, topological invariants associated to  a certain space of maps from Riemann surfaces into a Kahler manifold.  The  purpose of this project is to study natural families of such theories   (and their relatives) that arise from the geometry of these spaces and  to understand their properties under natural operations suggested by the  geometry.  Success should shed light on both the mathematics and the physics  involved.  ***",
