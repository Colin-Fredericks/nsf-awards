This  bi-annual conference will be only the  third  held  so  far.   The  two  previous conferences were held  in  Darwin,  N.T.,  Australia (1994) and in Bad Schandau, Germany (1996).  The  presently scheduled  conference is the first to be held  in  the  USA, in Boston, MA, Nov. 1-6, 1998.  Being held  in  the  USA  it  promises  to attract a  large  number  of  the  researchers located on the North American continent  because  of  the  minimal  travel cost.  It will thereby  assist  the  research   conducted  in  this field by  U.S.  investigators  through  the  provision of a major means  communication  and  interaction.  The  nature  of  the  subject,   excitons   in  condensed  matter, is interdisciplinary and  the  conference  brings   together   researchers  from  physics,   chemistry,  materials  and  the biological sciences.    This  conference  has the endorsements of IUPAP and IUPAC.  %%%  This  proposal  requests support to  enable  10-12  graduate  students  to  attend  and participate in the  EXCON'98-Third  International Conference on Excitonic Processes  in  Matter.
