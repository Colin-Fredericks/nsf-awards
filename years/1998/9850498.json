 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid prototyping equipment is requested for use in an introductory undergraduate course in which students design, build, and test their own experimental solutions to an on-going research problem at Columbia University. The course teaches CAD and CAD-based prototyping skills that can be quickly learned by students and then applied to a real world, scientific problem. Geometric and design aspects of the research problem are emphasized while technical aspects beyond the student capabilities are presented as fixed inputs. The cut-and-try philosophy of the course places a heavy fabrication burden on the professor and course TA because, by its introductory nature, students do not have prototyping backgrounds. The requested equipment will greatly reduce this burden and improve the linkage between the School' s existing CAD facilities and curriculum and its CAD-based prototyping capabilities. The course has no prerequisites and has attracted students from throughout the University. Although initially daunting, the challenge of \"out designing\" professors has been enthusiastically embraced by the students, and they appreciate that their efforts are being taken seriously despite their limited technical backgrounds. The course itself may serve as a national model for enabling undergraduates to perform original scientific work at research institutions, and may also attract new students to science and engineering. As part of this proposal, Columbia has committed funds for a comprehensive educational evaluation of the course by Teachers College and a documentary film about the course by the Graduate Film School. These concrete deliverables strengthen the proposed evaluation and dissemination plans.",
