CCU became independent of the University of South Carolina System in 1994, but remains a state-assisted university with its own Board of Trustees.  In its short history, CCU has established an outstanding record of faculty and student research with campus-wide emphasis on inquiry-based learning focused on undergraduate research programs.  The institution has been successful in developing an educational framework promoting the integration of research and education for all students.  The institution draws on its outreach to local schools to include university students and faculty working with in-service teachers and K-12 students.  \r\n\r\nThe University is being awarded $500,000 to advance institutional goals of integrating research and education, document and disseminate information of its exemplary activities, and expand the integration of research and education by conducting outreach activities over the coming three years.  CCU is at a unique juncture in its evolution and is well positioned to experience an effective augmentation to the variety of efforts underway in the integration of research and education.  To enhance the culture of inquiry, CCU will increase research efforts by faculty and students, assimilate integration into teaching-training programs for public school teachers who seek to enhance the discovery experience for their students, and develop interdisciplinary courses taught by faculty teams.\r\n",
