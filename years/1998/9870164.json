 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Proposal:  DMS-9870164  Principal Investigator:  Robert Bryant    The principal investigator plans to apply the theory of differential   systems and the method of equivalence to problems in differential  geometry and mathematical physics that have resisted more traditional  approaches, emphasizing two main problems.  A Finsler structure on a  manifold M assigns a notion of length to each tangent vector in M,  leading to a notion of length for paths in M. Riemannian geometry is a  special case where the length is derived from an inner product on  tangent spaces.  Finsler structures are essentially geometrized  calculus of variation problems and the fundamental problems involve  studying paths that are extremals of length (i.e., the geodesics),  their stability properties, their computability, and so forth.  As in  the familiar Riemannian case, the geometric object that controls  stability of geodesics is a sort of curvature tensor, called the flag  curvature.  Bryant plans to develop classification and global existence  theorems for Finsler structures with constant flag curvature, using  exterior differential systems techniques.  The second main problem  arises in certain models of super-symmetric string  theory that require  the construction on a smooth manifold of a connection  with reduced  holonomy, perhaps with torsion, out of a Riemannian metric and a  three-form.  The problem is to classify which pairs of metric and  three-form will allow the physical theory to be super-symmetric.   Bryant has already done the classification in various low dimensions  and is ready to study the intermediate dimensions (six through  twenty-six) that are of physical interest, using the techniques of  exterior differential systems that contributed to the solution of the  holonomy problem in the classical case (in which the three-form was  identically zero).  Bryant also plans to continue his collaboration  with Griffiths and Hsu on the geometry of PDE and their conservation  laws and to generalize  his recent structure theorems for harmonic  morphisms.    Optimization is a central problem in mathematics, in which one tries to  select the 'best' configuration in the space of possible configurations  in a model for a physical system.  An example is the problem of  navigating on a body of water in which one must take water currents  into account in planning the 'best' path from origin to destination,  where 'best' is taken to mean 'shortest time of traverse'.   A path  that is optimal for a short period (a 'geodesic') might not remain  optimal if pursued long enough.  This is known as instability.  (For  example, in a river where the current is faster in midstream it turns  out that downstream geodesics are stable, but that upstream geodesics  are not.)  The geometric quantity that measures this notion of  stability is known as 'curvature', since it was first identified in  studies of the curvature of the Earth. Bryant's work studies curvature  and 'over-determined' systems of differential equations, and is  relevant to optimization problems in motion planning, control theory,  robotics, and string theory models in high energy physics.",
