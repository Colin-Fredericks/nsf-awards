 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to design and implement an inquiry based undergraduate physics course for preservice K-8 teachers which integrates scientific content knowledge with research based knowledge about teaching and learning science. Research evidence has been building to support inquiry-based lessons, student centered pedagogy such as cooperative learning and peer teaching, and computer based laboratory instruction as effective strategies to improve student learning. This project will implement and evaluate these strategies in Physics 100, \"Concepts in Physics\", an introductory course for future K-8 teachers.    Of special concern are strategies to address ethnically diverse student populations. Teaching strategies such as \"Science Content And Language Expansion\" and programs such as \"Cooperative Education\" and \"Multicultural Infusion\" that have been effective in other disciplines will be tested in Physics 100.    A collaboration between a professor of physics, professor of education, and teacher from the local school district will design Physics 100 and integrate it with the science methods course in the School of Education. This design and integration process will become a new paradigm for collaborations between science and education departments and lay the foundation for establishing a coordinated science curriculum for pre-service teachers which reflects National and State wide reform efforts in K-12 Science Education.",
