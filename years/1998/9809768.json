 "awd_abstract_narration": "9809768\r\nByerly\r\n\r\nThe National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996), the Benchmarks for Science Literacy, Project 2061 (AAAS, 1993), and the Tennessee Science Framework Grades K-12 (1995) recognize the value of natural systems as embraced by geoscience for promoting interdisciplinary curricula; however, before a level of geoscience education in the K-12 classrooms can be consistent with these curricular guidelines, new tools (methods) for teaching Earth Systems Science and new opportunities for professional development in geoscience education for all science teachers must be available.  These needs will be addressed by constructing three virtual field trips as instructional modules that emphasize Earth systems.  Several information visualization methods will allow evaluation of each as potential learning vehicles.  Modules, suitable for K-12 and collegiate freshman-level geoscience students, as well as the public-at-large, will be interactive, taking full advantage of multiple ways to access information, and at the same time encouraging self-paced study and learner-centered activities.  Collaboration of K-12 and collegiate teachers to construct, test and assess the modules will afford opportunities for mutual professional development in Earth System Science.  Although Tennessee teachers and students are the focus for this project, web-based modules will be \"free\" instructional tools readily transferable to all educators (K-16) having access to the Net.  \"Geologic controls of landscape evolution\" is the chosen thematic vehicle for generating geoscience education modules because: 1) it is germane to Earth System Science education initiatives; 2) landforms are familiar to everyone, providing a natural platform for cognitive learning; 3) it is pertinent to the paradigm, \"landforms, climate, and resources of the earth's surface affect where and how people live and how human history has unfolded\"; 4) the scientific method involving multiple working hypotheses can be applied during exploration of contrasting landforms from diverse physiographic settings that include the Mississippi Embayment of the Gulf Coastal Plain, the Ridge and Valley and Appalachian Plateaus provinces, and a portion of the Central Rocky Mountains.  Given the weak initial background in Earth system science of many educators, these modules will be generating new science, but will be achieving the important results of involving the users in the scientific process.\r\n",
