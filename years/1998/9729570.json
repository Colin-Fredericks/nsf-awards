 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will compare the industrial, academic and governmental responses of the Allied and Central Powers during the First World War to unprecedented demands on their resources and technology in what became a total war.  Its focus will be upon the chemical industry, the mobilization of chemists, and the military role of chemistry during the war and into the early postwar era, considering some of the enduring consequences for the integration of science, technology and warfare.  The project will differ from previous analyses of chemical science and technology in the Great War by stressing the process as well as the product of chemical manufacture.  To analyze the infrastructure of technological innovation and production, the project will compare detailed case studies of three specific industrial locations in each major industrial nation (Britain, France, Germany and the United States) and the roles of specific companies, as well as the government agencies, university laboratories, and military inspection and procurement agencies with which they dealt.  The investigators will also employ a new approach in their project, applying the methodological framework of large-scale technological systems (interconnecting human and material resources, technical processes, and a culture of political-economic institutions), suitably modified to the unique exigencies of war.  By analyzing the function of the first modern, industrialized war in shaping a key technological system, the project will produce an integrated and comparative history that will serve as a model for future studies of the nexus of modern global military-industrial-scientific competition.  As such it should be of interest to policymakers as well as to historians.",
