 "awd_abstract_narration": "Barbara Wyslouzil is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue her experimental research on   nucleation of aerosol particles.  The goal of the proposed work is to use   small angle neutron scattering (SANS) to look for structure in   multicomponent nanometer sized liquid droplets in an aerosol.   Wyslouzil   will be looking for surface enrichment in multicomponent droplets which   she anticipates have internal structures on the nanometer length scale.    She has already perfected a supersonic nozzle design that produces   aerosol droplets of uniform size and has tested the feasibility of using   SANS for performing depth profiling experiments.  During the next phase   of this research program, Wyslouzil plans to address three tasks: 1)   conduct experiments with binary nanodroplets to determine their   composition and structure; 2) improve her ability to conduct SANS   measurements from aerosols; and 3) refine the data analysis procedures   and modeling for interpreting the SANS experimental data.  Multicomponent, nanometer-sized aerosol particles are produced by   nucleation and condensation in many industrial and natural settings.    Fine refractory particles form in combustion and metallurgical processes   while sulfuric acid - water droplets are produced in stack gases,   volcanic plumes, and as a byproduct of photochemical reactions in the   atmosphere.  The surface composition of these particles can strongly   affect heterogeneous reactions, growth and evaporation kinetics, and the   accomodation of trace gaseous species.  Wyslouzil's research will   contribute to our basic understanding of such phenomena.",
