 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF) Program and the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program of   the Office of Integrative Activities will support the development of an   accurate and reliable anomalous x-ray diffraction (AXD) spectrometer   consisting of a high-energy-resolution narrow-band-pass crystal-optics   monochromator and crystal analyzer.  This is a team effort involving   Susan Mini of the Physics Department at Northern Illinois University and   Timothy Graber and P. James Viccaro, both scientists at The Consortium   for Advanced Radiation Sources (CARS) of The University of Chicago.  The   spectrometer will allow utilization of full energy dispersion in   scattering cross-section of atoms near the absorption edge.  The   instrumentation, which will be installed on  beamline 15 at the Advanced   Photon Source (APS), will be used primarily for valence-specific static   and time-resolved chemical crystallography experiments.  Applications   include studies on large magnetoresistive oxides, surfaces and   interfacial properties of soft materials and time-dependent studies of   polymers.    The AXD technique will help solve unknown crystal structures containing   mixed-valent atoms in a way complementary to neutron diffraction and   local probes such as x-ray absorption spectroscopy.  AXD will also   provide a useful method to study the behavior of an element in a single   oxidation state with different types of coordination geometry.    Currently, AXD studies are carried out with energy resolution of a few   eV, which prevents selective modification of the structure factor of   atoms of one particular valence over another.  This instrument, with its   significantly higher resolution, combined with the high spectral   brilliance of the APS, will have significant impact in solid-state and   materials science.",
