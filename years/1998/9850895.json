 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal outlines a series of modular experiments that would help \"modernize\" the Holy Cross physical chemistry laboratories in two respects. The first meaning reflects the change in content from covering almost exclusively the \"classical\" macroscopic physical chemistry topics of thermodynamics and kinetics to the \"modern\" microscopic subjects of quantum and statistical mechanics. This change parallels the sequence of topics covered in the physical chemistry lecture courses. \"Modernize\" is also used to mean \"replace the existing outdated equipment\" with instrumentation that will provide many additional years of service.  There are three groups of experiments that are proposed. The first revisits the atomic emission spectroscopy laboratory that the students perform in general chemistry. After covering the quantum mechanical treatment of atomic electronic structure theory, the students will be ready to truly appreciate the quantization of the emission and will be able to quantitatively predict the frequencies and qualitatively understand the intensities observed in the emission spectra. The second set of laboratories investigates the vibrational spectroscopy of diatomic as well as CHaXb molecules. These measurements involve use both infrared absorption and Raman spectroscopy. A full group theoretical normal-mode analysis is used to correlate he spectral transitions with specific normal vibrations. The last group of laboratories uses a study of electronic transitions in molecular iodine to gain an intuitive understanding of diatomic potential energy curves. The interpretation of UV-Visible absorption, laser-induced fluorescence, and multiphoton ionization spectra will help accomplish this important goal.  The equipment requested is sufficient for but in no way limited to making the proposed measurements. The nitrogen-pumped dye laser, detectors, and the computer-interfaced data acquisition electronics provide for a versatile set of components that can be arranged in many ways to accomplish d ifferent types of spectroscopy. The requested FT-Raman attachment for the chemistry department  completes the list of equipment needed for these laboratories.",
