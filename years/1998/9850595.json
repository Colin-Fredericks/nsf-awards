 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal would establish an undergraduate Geographic Information Systems (GIS) instructional computer lab that would enable the Department of Geography and Planning, in cooperation with two research/education centers at Buffalo State College, to expand its course offerings, undergraduate research opportunities and to develop new and innovative K-12 curricula and teacher training tools. The requested instrumentation would serve to develop new courses in computer mapping for elementary and secondary education majors and to develop a summer workshop to provide similar training to teachers; to increase the effectiveness and number of computer mapping and GIS courses offered by the Department for its majors and other non-education majors; to increase opportunities for undergraduate students to undertake supervised research projects on social and environmental problems; and to develop within the Department a new course in the application of GIS methodology in the analysis of environmental and conservation issues. The project will be coordinated with the National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA) at SUNY Buffalo and in service teachers through the New York Geographic Alliance. Project results will be disseminated through standard academic outlets as well as in a national Conference on GIS in K-12 education organized by the NCGIA at SUNY Buffalo, the NCGLA at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the Department, to be held in Buffalo during the course of the project. In addition the results will be presented in panel discussions on GIS in Undergraduate Education to be held at the 1998 and 1999 Annual Conferences of the Middle States Division of the American Association of Geographers.",
