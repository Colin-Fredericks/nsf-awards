Since its founding, the College has provided a rich academic environment for integrating research and education.  The Engineering Clinic, a program focusing on teams of students practicing their profession by working on \"real problems for real clients\", has been extended to other scientific disciplines.  Each Harvey Mudd student is required to have a capstone senior experience in the form of a clinic project or a research thesis, and every curriculum includes a broad technical core that provides tools and knowledge for interdisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nThe College is being awarded $500,000 to advance institutional goals of integrating research and education, document and disseminate information of its exemplary activities, and expand the integration of research and education by conducting outreach activities over the coming three years.  By establishing integrated first-year, project-oriented laboratory courses, expanding the colloquia program, and creating interdisciplinary and peer mentoring summer projects, a successful program will be strengthened.  In addition, funds will be used to develop workshops for area K-12 science teachers, create an assessment program to evaluate the institution's efforts in integrating research and education, and create new summer research opportunities for minority students from the first year class.  An interesting component to the College's outreach efforts is \"FutureWatch\", a half-hour weekly radio and cable television broadcast exploring issues of science, technology, and the environment, an excellent vehicle used to inform the public.  An expanded format will include programs in which Harvey Mudd faculty and students discuss their own research activities, and the institution's efforts to perform integration activities.\r\n",
