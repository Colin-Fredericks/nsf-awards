 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microtine rodents are an ideal genus in which to study  the role of the environment on the covariation of  affiliative social relationships and patterns of paternal  and maternal behaviors, and to determine what  neurobiological variations are responsible for these  behaviors. Extensive field and laboratory data are available  on a number of closely related species with different social  and parental patterns of behavior. Microtus ochrogaster  (prairie voles) are primarily monogamous, with pair-bonding  and biparental care. In contrast, Microtus montanus (montane  voles) are promiscuous breeders and males rarely share the  nest of the female or care for young in the field.  Intermediate between these two extremes is Microtus  pennsylvanicus (meadow voles), which have a non-monogamous  mating system. During the summer breeding season, males are  rarely found in the nests of females or seen caring for  young. However, during the colder months of the year, males  are found in the field nests with the female and pre-  weanling young. Successful meadow vole colonies are rare and  cost only slightly more than mice to maintain. In contrast,  starting a new colony from wild caught individuals is  difficult, costly and time consuming. Thus, maintaining a  colony for access by other researchers and to maintain our  ongoing research examining variation in reproductive  behaviors across closely related species is valuable and  cost-effective.  During a year of support, while seeking  additional sources of  funding,  the PI will continue to test the hypothesis that  photoperiod and duration of cohabitation will influence the  formation of partner preferences and paternal behavior in  non-monogamous meadow voles, and behaviors may be equivalent  to those of monogamous prairie voles under some conditions.  Dr. Lee will determine the rate of development and the  extent of partner preferences demonstrated by male and  female meadow voles cohabiting under winter or summer  photoperiods and paternal behavior  of males. By manipulating  the environment (photoperiod), the PI expects to alter the  amount of affiliative and paternal behavior of meadow voles  and the rate at which these behaviors develop. Because males  in summer conditions are aggressive towards unfamiliar  animals and not prepared to live in groups, while animals in  winter conditions live in groups and are not aggressive, Dr.  Lee hypothesizes that full paternal care will be evident in  male meadow voles housed in SD without prior exposure to  pups. Alternatively, she may find no influence of  photoperiod on development of affiliative behaviors or  paternal behavior, indicating that seasonal changes in  sociality may not correlate with altered development of  these behaviors.",
