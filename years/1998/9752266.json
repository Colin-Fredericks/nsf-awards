 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project entitled\" Enhancing Mathematics Courses Through Engineering  Applications\" is a collaboration between the Mathematics Department and the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Departments. The project is informing and developing the understanding of engineering applications of mathematics, with the expectation that this motivates students within their math courses to understand how the math is used. The project is producing multimedia modules for specified mathematics courses, training math faculty on the use of the modules, implementing classroom use of the modules, and training faculty to  develop additional multimedia modules. Twelve multimedia modules are being developed. Each module consists of an applications module and two Maple labs based on the applications module. The applications modules are being developed using multimedia, including video, text, audio, and the computer. In the applications modules, in-depth engineering applications selected from courses are being introduced, the mathematics explained, the mathematics revisited with the math theory explained, and then extrapolation with in depth questions or other applications. The two associated Maple labs involve students interactively. The modules are being incorporated into the target courses.    The expected impact on students (87% African-American) is better understanding of the need to learn the math as well as better retention of the math. The expected impact on the teachers is more knowledge of applications and continued further understanding of and use of technology in instruction.",
