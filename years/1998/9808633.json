NER is the primary cellular system for the removal of most DNA lesions in humans and it is active in all cellular organisms.  NER recognizes and removes a wide variety of structurally unrelated lesions from DNA, but, the actual structural motif(s) that signals damage and begins the process of DNA repair are not obvious.  Because DNA lesions that are repaired do not pose a mutagenic threat, it is of particular interest to understand what triggers the recognition of damaged DNA by NER.  The long term goals of this study are to understand the factors involved in the molecular recognition between damaged nucleic acids and repair proteins.  As a means to realize these goals,   the internal dynamics and conformational equilibria in damaged and undamaged DNA oligonucleotides will be analyzed.  The specific aims are:\r\n\r\n1)  To determine the internal dynamics of undamaged and damaged DNA oligomers by NMR techniques, testing the hypothesis that lesion recognition and subsequent adduct removal require a conserved and common structural element in the damaged DNA not present in the parent, undamaged molecule that manifests itself as unusual internal dynamics.\r\n\r\n2)  To measure the torsion angles of the damaged and undamaged DNA molecules, testing the hypothesis that for damaged DNA molecules data fitting to a two-state interconverting deoxyribose sugar pucker model is inadequate, but that a two state model is adequate for undamaged DNA.  These studies will provide fundamental new information on the conformational states of damaged DNA and new insights into the recognition of damage by the NER system.\r\n\r\n2. Non-technical\r\n\r\nThe goal of this study is to improve our understanding of the conformational changes induced in DNA by mutagens and environmental toxins that may be the signal for damage recognition by nucleotide excision repair (NER).  The environment is full of compounds that react either directly or indirectly with DNA and these DNA adducts have been implicated in mutagenesis.  The basis for recognition of DNA damage by NER is not well understood and these studies will help make clear the molecular interactions between damaged nucleic acids and repair proteins. This study is to examine the structure and conformations of a family of DNA molecules having significant differences in overall structure as a consequence of covalent damage.  Particular emphasis is focused on the differences in backbone conformations among members of this family of damaged DNA molecules, as revealed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  Comparison of damaged DNA with undamaged DNA is expected to yield fundamental new information on the conformational states of damaged DNA and new insights into the recognition of damage by the NER system.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
