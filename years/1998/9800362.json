 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kristin Krantzman is supported by an RUI grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to perform molecular dynamics simulations   of the high-energy bombardment of organic targets on Cu(001)   microcrystallites with polyatomic projectiles.    She will examine the   emission yield of molecules and molecular fragments, and estimate the   surface damage.  She will also study the energy deposition into the solid   and the distribution of energy density in the solid support.  The   objective of the research is to shed additional light on the mechanism of   Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS) and Fast Atom Bombardment Mass   Spectroscopy (FABMS).  A good portion of the work will be performed in   collaboration with Barbara Garrison at Penn State University.    SIMS and FABMS are analytical mass spectroscopic sampling techniques that   are used in such diverse research applications as imaging human blood   cells, detecting pesticide residues on leaves and soil, and analyzing the   composition of Martian meteorites and the processing of semiconductor   devices.  Through the use of molecular dynamics simulations, Krantzman   will elucidate the fundamental processes that occur at the molecular   level in these sampling techniques.",
