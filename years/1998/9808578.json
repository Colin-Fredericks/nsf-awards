 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beale\r\nTetrapyrrole pigments comprise a family of biomolecules including hemes, chlorophylls, bilins, and vitamin B12- These pigments function as essential components in the processes of respiration and photosynthesis, and also exist as cofactors in other important enzyme reactions. All tetrapyrroles arise from a branched biosynthetic pathway that has (-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) as its first universal committed intermediate. The long-term goals of this project are to determine the structures, mechanisms of action, and regulation of the enzymes that catalyze ALA formation and metabolism in plants and algae, and to understand how ALA formation controls the photosynthetic pigment content of these organisms. Recent progress has exploited the unique genetic and biochemical potentials of the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii toward achieving these goals. Three Chlamydomonas genes, gtr, gsa, and alad, that encode enzymes which catalyze the first three steps of tetrapyrrole biosynthesis (glutamyl-tRNA reductase, glutamate 1-semialdehyde aminotransferase, and ALA dehydratase, respectively) have been cloned from Chlamydomonas. It is planned to express the cloned gtr gene which catalyzes the key, initial step of ALA formation, to obtain sufficient quantities of its product to be used for characterization of its physical and kinetic properties, cofactor content and requirements, reaction mechanism, possible interactions with other enzymes, and regulation of activity by allosteric effectors.\r\n\r\nThe importance of understanding the biosynthesis of ALA lies in its position as the initial universal metabolite in the diversion of cellular metabolites toward tetrapyrrole end products, and therefore the likely exercise of metabolic control over cellular pigment content by regulation of ALA formation. Moreover, the fact that ALA biosynthesis in all plants and most bacteria differs from that in animals suggests that it may be possible to develop herbicides and antibiotics that specifically target steps in the ALA biosynthetic pathway, and which are nontoxic to animals. Rational progress in this area will require a thorough knowledge of the five-carbon ALA biosynthetic pathway. Although herbicide and antibiotic development are not objectives of the proposed research, they serve to illustrate aspects of the potential longer-term significance of this research for human welfare.\r\n\r\n",
