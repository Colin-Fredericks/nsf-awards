 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electronic advancements of recent years have placed a challenge to undergraduate chemistry faculty to incorporate the use of modern chemical instrumentation into the undergraduate laboratories. To meet this challenge, undergraduate faculty members must use and understand the capabilities of modern instrumentation. This project updates the chemical instrumentation skills of two-year college chemistry faculty who teach in university transfer and chemical technology courses    Sinclair Community College and partners (George Mason University, University of Dayton, and Western Washington University) will offer a series of one-week chemistry instrumentation workshops.  Participants will be selected from two-year colleges across the United States with an emphasis on attracting women and minority faculty members.  each year a one-week instrumentation workshop for 18 participants will be held at George Mason University in Fairfax, VA; a second for 18 participants will be held at Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA.    Instruction will focus on instrument applications in undergraduate general and organic chemistry, introduction to instrumental analysis, associate degree chemical technology course applications, and applications of environmental chemistry.  Participants will select instruction in the following areas: Fourier-transform infrared, gas chromatography/mass spectroscopies, vapor phase and high performance liquid chromatography, computerized data acquisition and treatment multimedia approaches to chemical education, and environmental chemistry.",
