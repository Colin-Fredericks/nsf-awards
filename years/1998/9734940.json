 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on applying results developed by learning  theory researchers to real-life problems.  Such application-based  theoretical work is important so that the learning models and  problems studied capture as best possible the needs of real-life  problems.  Working to apply theoretical techniques to real  problems creates a better understanding of the real-world  problems and thus can help direct the future theoretical work,  facilitating the transfer of results from theory to practice.  Many networking protocols (as well as other system control  algorithms) utilize one or more tunable parameters, e.g.  thresholds and window sizes.  Frequently the methods used to set  or adjust the values of the parameters are ad hoc and are based  on certain assumptions about the operating environment, e.g.  assuming a particular distribution on the traffic patterns in a  communication network. This project will develop framework based  on formal learning methods for automatic parameter tuning in  system control algorithms to study if better performance can be  obtained. One such networking application this project will study  is that of dynamically adjusting delays of acknowledgements in  the TCP protocol.  Delaying  acknowledgements has two main advantages.  First, it allows a  single acknowledgement for more than one packet.  Second, if a  data packet is being sent in the opposite direction, then we can  piggy-back the acknowledgement too much can increase the latency.  Most TCP implementations used today employ some sort of  acknowledgement delay mechanism. This project investigates  several schemes to dynamically adjust acknowledgement delay,  including ones based on the Weighted Majority (WM) algorithms and  ones based on the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)  algorithm.  These schemes will be contrasted based on efficiency  and efficacy , as well as proving theoretical results about them  in terms of how well they respond to \"volatile\" TCP connections.  That is, if the connecti on occasionally switches from sparse data  transmission (where the goal might be to minimize latency, as in  the case of an interactive application) to dense data  transmission (where the goal might be to minimize the number of  acknowledgements and latency is not as important, as in the case  of a file transfer) and back again.  Simulation results will be  used to supplement the theoretical results. Applying learning  theory results to this problem and other networking problems will  then provide guidance in defining new theoretical learning models  that better model real-life scenarios.  This project will also  carefully develop and study such new learning models.",
