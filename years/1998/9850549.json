 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding is requested for a Wave-length Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (WDXRF) from which our students will obtain whole-rock chemical analyses for course-based and independent research projects. We propose to develop an integrated geochemical learning experience early in the geology major so that skills acquired in geochemical problem solving using analytical instrumentation-can be applied to upper level subdisciplines and independent research problems.  This project will focus on our required courses, Petrology and Chemistry of Earth Systems, which with Mineralogy and Bench Chemistry form the nucleus of the sophomore-year studies in the major. Petrology is in the early stages of being completely reformed into an inquiry-based format by our newest faculty member, Gene Yogodzinski. This format includes well conceived and controlled class research projects which aid in the understanding of geochemical principles fundamental to the study of rock and mineral associations. This approach, recently introduced in the Chemistry of Earth Systems course, has proven to be a viable means for students to apply chemical principles to geologic problems and for faculty to teach research methodologies. The acquisition of a WDXRF will allow our majors to better quantify igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary processes by \"tracing the fate\" of various major, minor, and trace elements through the integrated learning experience we propose.  In the capstone of our curriculum, a required independent research project, greater student demand for whole rock chemical data has been largely unmet. We will describe some of the projects that would have benefited from an in-house XRF spectrometer. We foresee even greater use for an XRF in student independent research projects in the future. Overall, we are striving for a balance between field study and instrumental analysis. An WDXRF is the missing link in the chain to provide students with accurate and precise whole rock chemical data in order that they may more fully understa nd the rock associations they observe so diligently in the field.",
