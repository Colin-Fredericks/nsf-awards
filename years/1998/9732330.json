 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goals of this project are:  (a) application of computational  group theory to related areas, and (b) scalability of  applications through parallelism.  This is expected to be useful  in areas of application including aspects of linear numerical  analysis, search (especially in the presence of symmetry) and  algorithmic parallelization.  This work will take advantage of a  sizable body of more mature and stable algorithms of  computational group theory that has evolved in recent years.  As  an example, the techniques for finding invariant subspaces of  matrices over finite fields (the meataxe and condensation) have  matured in recent years, while invariant subspace techniques are  of current interest for iterative techniques in numerical  analysis.    The relevant algorithms will be adapted to larger scale  applications through the use of parallelism and of data  structures adapted toward that parallelism.  The TOP-C parallel  methodology will be used to identify central, repetitive tasks.  The portability of this methodology across C, LISP, GAP and  other languages helps eliminate the continuing barriers to  extensive use of parallelization.",
