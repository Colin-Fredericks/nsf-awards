 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract of \"Unitary representations of reductive groups.\"    The philosophy of coadjoint orbits of Kirillov and Kostant predicts  that most irreducible unitary representations of reductive Lie groups  should arise by (parabolic or cohomological) induction from the (still  undefined) unipotent representations.  Each reductive group should  have just finitely many unipotent representations, and these should be  related to the (finitely many) nilpotent orbits of the coadjoint  representation.  This proposal has two parts.  The first (partly joint  with Susana Salamanca-Riba) concerns a precise version of the  Kirillov-Kostant prediction.  The goal is to characterize nicely a  small set of unitary representations with the property that every  unitary representation can be obtained from it by induction.  (The set  will include all unipotent representations, and also various  complementary series.)  The second (partly joint with William Graham)  concerns an idea for constructing unipotent representations.    More than fifty years ago, I. M. Gelfand set forth a program of  abstract harmonic analysis, a very general way to study mathematical  problems with symmetry.  Such problems appear in physics, and in  almost every part of mathematics.  One of the most fundamental  examples arises in connection with musical sounds.  In that case the  symmetry is passage through time: any two times are indistinguishable  in terms of what kinds of sounds can appear.  Gelfand's harmonic  analysis amounts to decomposing a sound into the \"pure tones\" produced  by a tuning fork (which change in an extremely simple way with the  passage of time).  Gelfand showed that a similar analysis was possible  in the presence of more complicated symmetry.  The role of the pure  tones is played by \"irreducible unitary representations.\"  This  project continues work done by many people on irreducible unitary  representations.  The central idea is this.  The formal definition of  an irreducible unitary representation involves linear a lgebra and  Euclidean geometry, in the form of what are called Hilbert spaces and  unitary operators.  These are exactly the objects needed to formulate  quantum mechanics.  In physics, quantum mechanical systems arise from  Newtonian ones by an (imperfectly understood) process known as  quantization.  An idea going back to Kirillov and Kostant in the 1960s  is that irreducible unitary representations should also arise by  \"quantization\" of some simple \"Newtonian\" analogues.  These Newtonian  analogues are fairly well understood, but the problem of quantizing  them is difficult.  On the other hand, similar quantization problems  appear in many parts of mathematics and physics, so there is no  shortage of examples to consider and ideas to try.",
