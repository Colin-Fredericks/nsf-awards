Emphasis is on  the  electronic,  thermal  and  magnetic properties studied by means  of  transport  annd  magnetic measurements. Much of the study will focus on  the  use  of  high  pressures to which the CMR effect is  particularly  sensitive.  Both  teflon-seal and diamond  anvil  cells  will  be  employed.   Isotopic   substitution  will  also   be   performed,  independently and in conjunction with the pressure  studies.  The  aim  of  the research is to clarify the fundamental interactions,  such  as  polaron  formation and dynamics,  responsible  for  the  unusual   transport  and  magnetotransport  behaviors  of   these  scientifically intriguing and potentially very useful  materials.  Other  materials of interest using the same experimental  methods  are  perovskite superlattices and fullerene polymers. The  latter  system  displays  a  pressure-induced insulator-metal  transition  similar  to  that  seen in CMR systems, although  the  underlying  physics  is  expected to be different. This research  program  is  interdisciplinary  in  nature  and  involves   several   graduate  students,  who  receive  excellent training  in  preparation  for  careers in industry, government laboratories or academia.  %%%  This  experimental  basic research project focuses  on  the  high  sensitivity  of  the electrical resistance of a  class  of  oxide  materials  to  a  magnetic field. This effect, which  has  become  known  as  \"colossal magnetoresistance\" (CMR)  is  scientifically  interesting and potentially of importance in improved technology.  In  this situation, the electrical resistance of the material  is  changed by an applied magnetic field, and such effects, which are  usually  very  small, in these materials are usefully  large.  An  attra ction  of  a  magnetoresistive sensor is  that  it  is  more  easlily minaturized, simpler, and cheaper to produce, than,  say,  the  coil  of  wire in many traditional magnetic pickup  devices.  Magnetic sensors are well known in computer hard drives, magnetic  tape  recorders  and  other  electronic  applications,  but   are  actually  widespread in simpler applications like rotation  speed  sensors  (tachometers)  and many others. This  experimental  work  focuses  on CMR materials in the manganite perovskite class,  and  seeks  to  clarify  the  physical  basis  for  the  effect.   The  experiments   concern  the  electronic,  thermal   and   magnetic  properties   studied   by   means  of  transport   and   magnetic  measurements.  Much of the study will focus on the  use  of  high  pressures to which the CMR effect is particularly sensitive. Both  teflon-seal  and  diamond anvil cells will be employed.
