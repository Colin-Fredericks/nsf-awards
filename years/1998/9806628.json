 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bolstad  9806628    Work by scientists over the last decade strongly points to human-caused  global warming, and several studies have predicted large changes in the  wood production, water production, and distribution of our forests.  Some scenarios suggest cool-loving trees such as spruces, firs, and some  maples, will retreat northward as climates become too warm. Others suggest  forests may die out altogether in some regions, to be replaced  by grass or other more drought or heat tolerant life forms. The PIs' study is designed to identify the impacts of changing temperatures on the  physiology of eastern deciduous forest trees, and so help better determine  how the forests will respond to changing climate. All living organisms  respire as the convert food into energy, and plants are no different.  However in plants, there is a balance between food production  (photosynthesis) and consumption (respiration), which changes, depending on  the temperature. The PIs' study is designed to identify just how much plants have adapted to natural changes in  temperatures. The PIs will measure respiration across the natural range for  white oak and red maple, two species found from Florida to New England  to Minnesota to Arkansas. By studying these species in their native  locations, and by planting seedlings from all these sources in common  gardens, the PIs will determine far plants have adjusted their physiology  to  natural changes in temperature, and improve our ability to predict how they  will respond to future temperature changes.",
