 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the control of S02 emissions to the from coal-fired power plants.  Since any economical reductions of the sulfur content of coal used by utilities is through blending of various coals, it proposes the development of a neutron-based on-line coal analyzer.  This analyzer will measure in real time the sulfur content of coal along with other important coal bulk parameters such as caloric value, moisture, density, volatile matter etc., that affect the efficiency of the power plant  The main features of the proposed analyzer which is based on pulsed fast/thermal neutrons are self-calibration independent of the coal seam, diminished radiation risk, and better accuracy in the determination of elements such as carbon, oxygen and sodium.  The proposed on-line coal analyzer is to be used by coal mines, coal preparation plants and coal-fired power plants worldwide  In the U.S., there exist nearly 900 of the above coal related facilities, and over 100 on-line analyzers have already been installed.  This research addresses the issues that the existing analyzers have problems with, and, in the beginning, it targets approximately 100 coal mines that have been identified as potential users of the pulsed neutron technology.  This award is supported by the Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).",
