 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806710  Kambhampati    The wood-feeding cockroach genus, Cryptocercus, is the sole  representative of the family Cryptocercidae and is generally considered to  be among the basal lineages of extant cockroaches.  At present, four  species are recognized worldwide within the genus. The distribution of  Cryptocercus in the U.S. is disjunct, with a set of populations distributed  along the Appalachian Mountains and another along the coastal mountains in  the Pacific Northwest.  All Cryptocercus in the eastern U.S. are presently  classified as a single species.  However, recent evidence based on DNA  sequence analysis, chromosome analysis and mating studies indicated that  there may be as many as four species of Cryptocercus in the U.S.  Subsequent analysis of DNA sequence of the nuclear rRNA genes and ITS2  confirmed the results based on sequence analysis of mitochondrial rRNA  genes.  Given the existence of 4 or more Cryptocercus species in the U.S.,  the overall objective of the proposed studies is to delineate their  geographical and biological boundaries.  The specific objectives of the  proposed research are: (1) Characterize sequence variation in mitochondrial  rRNA genes within and among populations of Cryptocercus.  (2) Characterize  chromosome number variation among populations of Cryptocercus. (3) Develop  formal descriptions and morphological keys for the new species of  Cryptocercus.  Samples with different karyotypes will be examined to  identify consistent and fixed morphological differences that can be used  for identification of the new Cryptocercus species and possibly in  cladistic analysis along with the DNA sequences. Together, these studies  will be a comprehensive analysis of species boundaries using multiple  quantitative criteria.",
