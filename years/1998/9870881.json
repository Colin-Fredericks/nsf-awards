Texas    The goal of this proposal is preparation, characterization and utilization of novel interface structures based on block copolymers attached to surfaces.  The self-assembling tendency of block copolymers will be exploited.  The project will include (1) synthesis of various block copolymers (some with fluorescent tags) by anionic polymerization; (2) preparation and characterization of micelles formed by these copolymers; (3) attachment of these micelles to various surfaces; (4) modification of the micelle-coated surfaces by various processing steps such as solvent and/or temperature cycling; (5) characterization of the surfaces by an array of techniques; (6) studying the interaction of the dry surfaces with various vapors and of the submerged interfaces with soluble probes.  It is surmised that, besides the intrinsic interest in these novel structures, the project may lead to valuable advances in the fields of chemical sensing, optical data storage and drug delivery. The principal investigator has had extensive experience in most of the techniques proposed.  Most of the equipment and instrumentation needed is either routinely used in the PI labs or is readily available within the University of Texas.  ***",
