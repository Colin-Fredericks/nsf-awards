One aspect is the empirical  search  for  new  superconductors. A second aspect deals with issues and mechanisms  operative   in   the   cuprate   family   of   high   temperature  superconductors. Topics under investigation include the  role  of  the  charge reservoir block; the Fermi-liquid or non Fermi-liquid  behavior  in  the  overdoped regime; the  possibility  of  higher  transition   temperatures;  the  possibilities   of   non-cuprate  materials with high transition temperature; and the formation and  stability  of  such compounds. Synthesis techniques include  high  pressure,   rapid   quench  from  vapor,  solid-state   reaction,  wet-chemistry,  and  arc-melting. Physical  properties  including  structural, transport and magnetic are determined at ambient  and  high    pressures;   other   properties   are    determined    in  collaborations.  This  research program is  interdisciplinary  in  nature  and  involves one or more graduate students, who  receive  excellent  training  in  preparation  for  careers  in  industry,  government laboratories or academia.  %%%  This  experimental research project focuses on  high  temperature  superconductivity.  Much of this research deals  with  the  oxide  superconductors  containing copper oxide planes such  as  Yttrium  Barium   Copper  Oxide,  YBaCuO7,  which  has  a  superconducting  transition temperature of 92 Kelvin.

This research could lead to new  superconductors  with  possibility  of applications in improved  technologies  for  electric  power generation, electric power transmission, electric  motors   and  transmissions,  energy  storage,  and  electronics;  including  analog  to  digital converters,  high  speed  computer  circuits,  and  cellular telephone base stations.
