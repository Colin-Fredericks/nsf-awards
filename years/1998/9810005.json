 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810005  Hajjar  This project presents a combined computational/experimental  effort focusing on the seismic behavior of the interface between  concrete walls and steel frame members in composite wall  structural building systems.  The work targets the development of  comprehensive, nonlinear, static and dynamic analysis procedures  for modeling composite wall building structures, including the  behavior of the steel/concrete interface; and achieving a more  through understanding of the composite cyclic interaction between  RC walls and steel framing. Composite structural wall systems  provide excellent strength and stiffness to withstand both  service level drift and ultimate forces from seismic events.    The objectives of the research include the development of a  finite element formulation for the seismic analysis of composite  reinforced concrete walls with surrounding steel framing, the  quantification through experimental testing of the combined  cyclic shear and tensil strength of headed hear studs and  deformed bar anchors embedded in concrete panels, and the  verification and calibration of the shear and axil strength  interaction relations under monotonic and cyclic loading for  connectors used in practice used in practice.    A three-dimensional, nonlinear finite element to model to  simulate the cyclic interaction at the steel/concrete wall  interface will be formulates.  A series of experiments will be  designed to document the cyclic interaction along the interface  between RC walls and surrounding steel framing.  The analyses  will feature a geometrically and materially nonlinear finite  element formulation, using a new fiber-based finite element for  the shear connectors and appropriate continuum elements for the  concrete in the interface region, align with stress-space  plasticity formulations for both the concrete and steel.  The  ultimate goals is the development of clear guidelines for: 1)  incorporating the steel-concrete interface behavior in both  linear and nonlinea r analyses of composite wall systems; and 2)  detailing the steel frame-concrete panel connection to achieve  desirable performance goals.    This project is supported under the fourth year competition of  NSF 94-154.  ***",
