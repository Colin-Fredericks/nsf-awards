 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726615  Georgiadis    This award supports a three year collaborative research  project between Professor John Georgiadis of the University  of Illinois, Urbana and Professor Ken Okazaki of the Tokyo  Institute of Technology in Japan.  The researchers will be  undertaking studies relating to magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI) of heat and mass transfer in complex internal flow  systems.  The research involves systematic non-invasive  measurements with MRI in order to accomplish the following  objectives:  (l) the flow field in a class of complex  internal structure (fixed microchannels) will be  characterized as a function of hydrodynamic conditions and  degree of structural disorder.  Pressure-driven, laminar,  and incompressible flows through fixed solid matrices with  complicated interstitial space will be considered and (2)  under conditions of objective 1, the temperature and the  dispersion of miscible fluid will be quantified during  convective transport in the same geometries.  MRI  measurements will be compared to the results of direct  numerical simulation via Lattice Boltzmann methods, and will  be used to improve existing models of convective transport.     This project brings together the efforts of two  laboratories that have complementary expertise, research  capabilities and equipment.  The two groups have access to  mutually complementary MRI facilities with the Japanese MRI  scanner designed for higher magnetic field strength, and  thus higher resolution.  The proposed work will contribute  to fundamental knowledge in the areas of advanced  diagnostics and will also demonstrate the feasibility of  combining experimental MRI and numerical tools to analyze  complex thermohydrodynamic systems encountered in the design  of industrial devices.  Younger scientists will also be  included in the project.  Through the exchange of ideas and  technology, this project will broaden our base of basic  knowledge and promote international understanding and  cooperation.  ***",
