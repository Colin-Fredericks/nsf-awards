 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810557  Bettermann   This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer project aims to: (1) design, build and program a simple, dedicated instrument for Submitochondrial particle (SMP) performing tests, (2) develop software and protocols capable of flexibly addressing real world monitoring situations, (3) provide a limited number of demonstration units to potential customers for beta testing purposes, and (4) build toward a fully autonomous instrument (Phase II).  SMP tests consist of a suite of robust biochemical toxicity bioassays that are simple and inexpensive to perform; require only basic laboratory equipment to conduct; and yield near-real time data (minutes).  Bioenergetic processes critical to cell viability are measured by tracking the redox status of nicotinamide coenzymes by spectrophotometry, although other detection schemes (O2 dye coupling, fluorescence, use of lasers, etc.) are feasible.  The technology has been proven to perform well in a variety of environmental and industrial situations as a surrogate for conventional whole-organism toxicity tests.          Potential commercial applications are manifold and diverse, but acceptance has been slow for lack of a cheap (<$300), dedicated, yet flexible instrument that would minimize user training and could be incorporated into automated processes. Microcontroller devices are simple, inexpensive, programmable computing devices with data input/output capabilities linkable to detectors, controllers, and other devices.",
