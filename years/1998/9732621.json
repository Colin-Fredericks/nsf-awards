 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9732621  Hyde  The proposed project continues a summer undergraduate  research program already in place for the past four summers  at Baylor and currently supported by both Baylor and the  National Science Foundation.  Seven students will be  selected from open applications with the program advertised  at universities around the nation, smaller undergraduate  institutions with little or no research capability and  historically minority institutions.  Complete application  information, departmental research information as well as  the ability to apply to the program \"on-line\" is provided  through a World Wide Web page located at  www.baylor.edu/~Truell_Hyde/Scripts/URC.html. allows  identification and recruitment of outstanding students from  small, private institutions in the Texas, Oklahoma,  Louisiana, Arkansas, and Kansas areas.  The NSF Fellows will  interact during the summer with Baylor undergraduate and  graduate students from both the United States and several  foreign countries.  They will participate in twice weekly  seminars, social activities, an end of the summer  Undergraduate Research Symposium and specially designed  classes in various physics research fields of interest.  As  in the past, it is expected that at least some of the summer  research done by the NSF Fellows will result in peer  reviewed publications.  Trips to nearby industries and  research facilities, social activities as well as joint  research seminars will be offered (as in the past) in  cooperation with other REU activities that will be held on  the same campus.  This provides for a much larger number of  NSF Summer Fellows with which to interact during the ten  week period and aids in producing a \"large\" program feel.    ***",
