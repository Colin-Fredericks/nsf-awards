The PI will study  001  tilt boundaries that  often occur in textured films grown on textured Ni/Cu tapes  as well as certain special boundaries in YBCO films on  single crystal substrates.  Some YBCO tilt boundaries will  be prepared by using highly specific bicrystals,  tricrystals, n-crystals as templates for film growth.  Low  indices planes as boundary planes will be engineered in  these template substrates to avoid faceting in the YBCO  films.  Critical current densities on individual boundaries  will be measured by imaging the boundary Josephson vortices  (the widths of these vortices are directly related to the  local critical current density).  The magnetic flux quantum  imaging is performed by scanning superconducting quantum  interference device microscopy (SSM).  The same boundaries  will be studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with  back-scattering channeling Kikuchi patterns to identify the  5 geometric parameters of each boundary.  Critical current  densities of boundaries will be plotted as a function of the  geometric parameters.  Any out of plane component of  misorientation or with a misorientation axis other than   100  will be noted and recorded.  Individual boundaries  observed in SSM and SEM will be matched by fiducial points  on the samples.  Special areas of important boundaries will  be prepared into planar view samples for observation in  transmission electron microscopes employing diffraction  contrast microscopy, electron diffraction, high resolution  electron microscopy, boundary composition mapping with  energy dispersive x-ray analysis, and chemical mapping with  electron energy-loss spectroscopy.  Boundary segregation and  intergranular films will be detected.  In addition to  perfectly stoichiometric targets, slightly  off-stoichiometric targets will be used to make YBCO films.  These off stoichiometric  films can be used to assess the  degree of susceptibility to segregation of different  boundaries.  The geometric specifications of these  001   tilt boundaries from microscopy will be related to their  structure, their composition mapping, their local Josephson  penetration lengths, their critical current densities, and  the overall film compositions.  %%%  Grain boundaries in materials often control the properties  of that material.  This is especially true in high-  temperature superconductors, and limits the usefulness of  devices made from these materials in commercial and military  applications.  An understanding of the grain boundary effect  on the superconducting properties will enable device  engineers to develop better devices from these materials.  ***",
