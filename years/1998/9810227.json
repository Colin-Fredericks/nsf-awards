In addition, the proposers will develop a related certificate program for students interested in a shorter program focused on electronic packaging.  At present, the field of packaging has no formal degree programs, but many companies around the world are involved in it.  The masters degree program will have three components:  (1) engineering component; (2) management component; and (3) international affairs components.  Graduates of the masters degree and certificate programs will be prepared for work in industry in the field of electronic packaging, regardless of whether the graduate is located in the US or abroad.  This award builds on previous activities of the Center, notably the Global Innovation for Engineers program, which piloted the core concepts in the certificate and masters programs.  Representatives of corporate members of the Center will serve as advisors as the programs are developed, ensuring that the knowledge, skills, ad capabilities acquired by students are those needed by engineers in the packaging industry, regardless of the country in which they are assigned.",
