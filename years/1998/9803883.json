The project will combine a nationally broadcast one-hour PBS special with print and interactive educational materials for the home and school markets along with family-oriented personal appearance by host-author David Macaulay at selected museum and mill sites across the country.  The goal of the project is to acquaint viewers and participants with the technological innovations and the scientific, social and historical significance of water-powered mills in the early part of the industrial revolution.   In addition to the television program the project will produce Mill Times newspapers applicable in formal as well as informal settings, curriculum-based school videos and teachers guides, activity kits including \"toys\" designed to introduce concepts in applied mechanics, and family-activity programs at selected sites.       The PI and Producer/Director will be Larry Klein who has produced and directed the previous Macaulay programs among many other PBS specials.  David Macaulay, author of many best-selling books on architecture and technology, will be the host and will work closely with Mark Olshaker, the writer, in developing the script for the program.  The Education Director will be Toby Levine.  The principal technology and history advisor will be Patrick Malone, Assistant Professor of Urban Studies and American Civilization at Brown University and past president of the Society for Industrial Archaeology.  The science advisor will be Theodore Ansbacher, principal of Science Services, an informal science education consulting company.  Other advisors include Robert Dalzell, Gary Kulik, Judith McGaw, and Merrit Roe Smith.",
