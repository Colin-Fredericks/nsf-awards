 "awd_abstract_narration": "9614410  Farmer      This collaborative study is aimed at understanding the evolution of  the lithosphere of the Rocky Mountain transect in the North  American southwest.  This transect is located at the juncture of  two globally-unique tectonic regimes, each of fundamental  importance for understanding continental tectonics and together  representing an outstanding field laboratory for studies of  continental lithosphere.  First, a 1000 km wide juvenile  Proterozoic orogenic belt records rapid accretion of continental  materials from mantle sources and their assembly to southern  Laurentia along NE-trending boundaries between 1.8 and 1.6 Ga.   Second, the present high elevation of the SW in general and the  Rocky Mountains in particular is the manifestation of Laramide,  Tertiary, and still ongoing modification of Proterozoic Lithosphere  that has resulted in a wide NW-trending mantle boundary zone  between old, cold, high velocity mantle in the continental interior  and hotter, lower velocity mantle in the western U.S.  By examining  the present-day lithospheric structure across ancient boundaries,  the P.I.s hope to better understand the interplay between \"active\"  and \"passive\" processes during lithospheric evolution.     Their principal hypothesis is that lithospheric structures produced  during assembly of the southwestern U.S. have profoundly influenced  physical and chemical modification of the continental lithosphere  during all subsequent magmatic and tectonic events, including those  related to the ongoing reorganization of small-scale asthenospheric  convection and replacement of lithosphere by asthenosphere.  To  test this hypothesis, they propose an integrated set of multi-scale  experiments using state of the art geophysical, geological and  geochemical techniques that, together, are designed to decipher  lithosphere structure and evolution, and processes of lithosphere  formation and deformation.  ***",
