The approach involves systematic study of  lattice defects in high-purity SI CdZnTe grown from melt by  Bridgman techniques in order to understand their role in  electrical compensation and carrier trapping. Doping and growth  experiments with thermally stimulated and positron annihilation  spectroscopies will be combined to identify defects and determine  their trapping parameters. The incorporation of selected  impurities and the formation of defects as a function of growth  conditions will be studied to determine key thermodynamic  parameters controlling defect formation and incorporation. The  concentration of impurities will be measured by glow-discharge  mass spectroscopy and resonance-ionization enhanced mass  spectroscopy and correlated with thermal spectroscopies and  positron annihilation. Infrared microscopy and absorption will be  used to study the formation of Cd and Te precipitates and their  effect on the incorporation of impurities and the formation of  defect complexes. Annealing experiments will be conducted to shed  study diffusion properties of dominant defects and provide a  better understanding of defect diffusion and formation during  cooling of the crystals following solidification. The project is  co-supported by the DMR Electronic Materials Program and the MPS  OMA(Office of Multidisciplinary Activities).  %%%  Basic research issues in a topical area of materials science  having technological relevance are addressed by this project. The  basic knowledge and understanding gained from the research is  expected to contribute to improving the performance and stability  of advanced devices by providing a fundamental understanding and  a basis for designing and producing improved materials, and  materials combinations.  An important feature  of the program is  the integration of research and education by providing an  important educational opportunity through the GOALI aspect of the  project for academic personnel to experience both academic and  industrial research approaches and environments.  ***",
