Our approach will be to analyze a time series of bison and deer bones (Recent to 100,000 yo) and samples resulting from a heating experiment to simulate diagenesis.  The use of osteocalcin and the application of MALDI-MS provide a unique position of strength for the proposed research.  Osteocalcin has several extremely important attributes which include intimate association with the hydroxyapatite mineral phase of bone, preferential preservation over time, exclusive occurrence in vertebrate mineralized tissues, absence in common contaminators including microbes, invertebrates and plants, immunological specificity of the intact protein via radioimmunoassay (RIA), and the existence of an extensive database of protein sequences for osteocalcin.  Furthermore, the MALDI-MS technique can identify very small quantities of protein (8 pmol of protein is typical) and is not confronted by the myriad of problems that confront traditional methods of protein sequencing.  Our preliminary work has confirmed the presence of osteocalcin via RIA in bones as old as 450,000 years.  In addition, we have generated other lines of evidence, including MALDI-MS data that suggests the presence of intact OC in 800 to 53,000 year old bones.  Owing to the ability of MALDI-MS with peptide mass mapping and post source decay analysis to provide protein sequence information, this approach will allow us to make a direct assessment of diagenetic changes in the primary structure of osteocalcin and to characterize modifications of individual amino acids throughout diagenesis.  Furthermore, this approach will revolutionize our ability to unambiguously identify an indigenous component from a fossil.\r\n",
