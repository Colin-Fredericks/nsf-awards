 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Summary      Ecological factors have a variety of effects on the behavior  of  organisms. However, relatively little is known in detail  about how these factors translate into different behavioral  decisions. This study will address ecological and social  variables affecting behavioral decisions during reproduction  in a seldom-studied migratory songbird, the yellow-breasted  chat. A combination of radiotelemetry, molecular genetics,  behavioral observation and field experiments will be used to  follow the movements, mating patterns, and behavioral  choices of both males and females. Additionally ecological  variables (vegetation density and food abundance) will be  measured. This study will assess the often cryptic movements  of chats (particularly females), offspring paternity,  behavior of each sex in relation to the other, and the  consequences for the reproductive success of individuals.  This study has several scientifically important features.  First, it  will test general processes, proposed in more theoretical  literature, shaping male/female interactions. Second, it  will provide a more detailed understanding of the effect of  ecological factors on breeding behavior. These features will  offer valuable insight into the potential problems faced by  a little-known migratory songbird and  also uncover some of the ways in which these problems are  overcome. Finally, this project will enhance the training of  promising graduate and undergraduate students.",
