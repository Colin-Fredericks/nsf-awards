The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. William A. Hoffmann to work with Dr.  Augusto C. Franco at the Universidade de Brasilia in Brazil.  Their work will involve the comparison of the ecophysiology  of savanna and forest trees as a key to understanding the  dynamics of the savanna-forest boundary.    The objectives of this research are: to measure differences  in water relations, leaf-level physiology, and distribution  patterns between savanna and forest species to show  convergent evolution of traits within each of these two  groups of species; to measure the importance of allocation  patterns versus ecophysiological adaptations to the  differences in the performance of savanna and forest  species; and to determine what environmental factors limit  the growth of savanna and forest trees across the savanna-  forest boundary.  They will conduct this research within the  cerrado, a savanna vegetation that occupies 2 million  kilometers of Brazil.    Dr. Franco's area of expertise is in the area of the  physiological basis of woody plant ecology in the cerrado.  In addition to working with the facilities of the University  of Brasilia, Dr. Hoffmann will have access to a national  park, three ecological reserves and two research stations,  all of which are accessible for this type of research.    ***",
