Highly  correlated  electron properties of interest include spin  density  waves, charge density waves, the quantum Hall effect and multiple  order  parameter superconductivity. The experiments utilize  high  magnetic  fields, obtained at a unique in-house  pulsed  magnetic  field facility, as well as at NHMFL. The studies also feature use  of high pressure and low temperature. High magnetic field is used  in  part  to  quench  the  superconducting  or  other  correlated  electron state, allowing observation of quantum oscillations  and  other  effects  to  probe the Fermi surface. The  RF  penetration  depth is measured in addition to electronic transport properties.  The results from this basic investigation may include fundamental  new  physical effects and also may provide insight into  electron  behavior in other systems including semiconductor microelectronic  devices.This  highly interdisciplinary project involves  graduate  students who pursue thesis research at both laboratory locations,  and  receive excellent training beneficial to a future career  in  industry, government or academia.  %%%  This  experimental  research  project  focuses  on  unusual   and  potentially useful electronic conducting materials, which  differ  from  common  metals  such  as copper and  silver  in  two  major  respects. First, the are composed of organic molecules, or oxides  of metals. Second, they have very different electrical conduction  in   different   directions.  The  anisotropy  of  the   electron  conduction  in  some  of  these  materials  tends  to  favor  one  particular  direction,  so they are \"one-dimensional\";  in  other  cases planes are present which are highly conductive, and this is  a  \"two-dimensional\" conductor.  The behavior of  electrons  under  these conditions is often unusual, and this unusual behavior  and  the  reasons for it are the topic of the research. The  materials  of  interest  in  this project are mostly organic superconductors  and  molybdenum oxide bronzes. Measurements feature high magnetic  fields,  obtained  at  a  unique in-house pulsed  magnetic  field  facility, as well as at the NSF-supported National High  Magnetic  Field  Laboratory  (NHMFL) located at Florida  State  University.  Measurements   also  feature  use  of  high  pressure   and   low  temperature.  The  results  from  this  basic  investigation  may  include  fundamental new physical effects and  also  may  provide  insight   into  electron  behavior  in  other  systems  including  semiconductor     microelectronic    devices.     This     highly  interdisciplinary project involves graduate students  who  pursue  thesis   research  at  both  laboratory  locations,  and  receive  excellent  training  beneficial to a future career  in  industry,  government or academia.  ***",
