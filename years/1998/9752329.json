 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a junior level biochemistry laboratory course which:  1. Provides students with the necessary skills to become attractive candidates to industrial recruiters or graduate schools; 2. Increases the interest and the ability of students to successfully carry out undergraduate research projects in their senior year; and 3. Serves as a model and guide for a variety of small institutions who wish to implement a similar class.  The model adapts for a consortium of small HBCU's and expands to a year long format a one semester laboratory course developed and implemented by Paul Craig of the Rochester Institute of Technology.  A number of new techniques are added to include the investigation of authentic unknowns.  Students learn cutting-edge methods in biochemistry and molecular biology and develop the critical thinking skills to analyze the original data they generate.  Evaluation of the course is accomplished through pre- and post-course examinations, attitudinal surveys and retrospective follow-up of student progress.  Results are being disseminated via a series of WWW pages that include student input.",
