 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802259  Campbell    A differential algebraic equation  (DAE) is  a system of equations  relating various quantities with some of their derivatives.  However,  unlike with an ordinary differential equation (ODE), the equations do  not directly provide all the derivatives of the state variables.     A  nonnegative integer called the  index is one measure of how far a DAE  is from an ODE which is index zero.  The higher the index the greater the  difficulty in working with the system.   Many  physical problems are  most naturally initially modeled as a DAE particularly those that are  analyzed and simulated using computer generated mathematical models.  Because of the importance of DAEs in applications a variety of numerical  techniques have been developed in recent years to simulate and analyze  DAEs.  These techniques, while very useful, are limited to systems with  special structure and low index (no more than three and often limited to  one or two)    This project is to investigate the analysis, simulation, and application of  high dimensional, higher index DAEs of unknown and nonstandard structure.  Two applications, of considerable independent interest, will be considered  to serve as both application of, and guide for, the theoretical,  analytic,  and numerical work.  The first application is the optimization of the path  of a trim tool.  A trim tool is a machine used for cutting a part from a  piece of metal.  Improved performance of trim tools is of great importance  for manufacturing and industrial competitiveness.  The second application is  the simulation of densely packed high frequency circuits for which current  industrial simulation packages are inadequate.  The robust solution of these  types of problems requires additional fundamental theoretical results and  algorithms for high index high dimensional DAEs.  This project will develop  theory and computational algorithms for high index high dimensional  DAEs and apply them to the two applications.  For both of these  applications  the high fidelity models needed are mixed systems of partial  differential equations, DAEs, and  constraints.  Their  solution will  require  examining the interplay between type of  model, type of approximation process,  and resulting types of DAEs.",
