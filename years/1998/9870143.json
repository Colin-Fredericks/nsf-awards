 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870143\r\nSchuessler\r\nLaser based photo acoustic methods provide the possibility to excite short wavelength surface acoustic waves (SAWs) with extremely high amplitudes.  Such waves present an efficient tool for the investigation of elastic and mechanical properties of solid materials.  Until recently suface acoustic waves remained among the few wave phenomena  for which strong nonlinear effects were not observed, since it was not possible to excite and detect them with traditional methds.  The manifestation of these nonlinear phenomena depends on the nonlinear constants of the solid which reflect the microscopic structure and quality of the material and the changes due to treatment, fatigue, and wear.  \r\n\r\nThe objective of the project is to develop a SAW spectrometer based on laser excitation and detection of broadband SAW pulses.  The method will be applied to characterize industrial and natural materials such as fused silica, crystalline silicon, metals, and polymers.\r\n\r\nThe project will contribute to a better understanding of the propagation of nonlinear SAWs in isotropic and anisotropic solid materials, to the development of efficient techniques for their generation and detection, as well as to diagnostic methods of surface and bulk elastic properties of solid materials.  The study of nonlinear surface acoustic waves will provide an impact on different fields such as materials science, acousto electronics, nonlinear acoustics, theory of nonlinear waves, and seismology.  Support of this project will enhance the education and training of students at Texas A&M University.\r\n%%%\r\n*** \r\n",
