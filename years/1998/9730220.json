 "awd_abstract_narration": "Inquiry into the dynamics of persuasion is axiomatic to political science, psychology, and communication studies.  This dissertation project argues that persuasion is not so much about convincing others to change their minds as much as it is about framing the terms of the debate - - getting people to think about issues in desired terms (e.g. defining the debate over abortion in terms of women's rights rather than `life`).  Visceral appeals enhance prospects for persuasion in that they distract the message receiver from the propagandist's manipulation.  Thus, the most persuasive rhetoric should incorporate elements of both cerebral, `hard` arguments and emotionally laden `easy` arguments.  This hypothesis is tested by analyzing the relationship between talk radio listening and public opinion/political behavior.  Content analysis and surveys are used to discern the extent to which talk radio hosts activate particular mental maps to induce listeners to resist governmental activism, oppose Democratic candidates, and participate in various political activities.  Survey based results indicate that negative, humor-laden messages that `prime` some values over others (e.g. personal responsibility over philanthropy), succeed at moving opinions and engendering participation.   The dissertation executes a careful experimental design and promises to enhance substantially our understanding of the topic.",
