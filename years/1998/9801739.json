 "awd_abstract_narration": "9801739  Allara    The goal of this project is to provide an increased fundamental  understanding of the underlying behavior of the interfaces of  organic materials. While it is generally well appreciated that  the details of substrate structure and chemistry play a critical  role in determining the interface properties, the current  mainstream research in polymer interfaces has placed only a small  fraction of total effort here.  The proposed work is intended to  fill this important gap through studies of chains confined at  well-defined surfaces in controlled ways.  Based on new  developments in the past results from the principal  investigator's work, three parallel sub-thrusts are proposed: 1.)  morphological effects of surface confinement of polymethylene  (PM) nano-clusters on transition metal surfaces; 2.) interface  reconstruction effects in wetting of surface-grafted chain  assemblies; and 3.) structure and dynamics of adsorbed flexible  chains constrained at controlled architecture surface sites  and/or by secondary adsorbate species. In area 1 the work will  probe deeply into confinement effects on structure and phase  transitions of PM on varied metal crystal faces.  Further, the  polymer will be varied by inclusions of side chains and limited  extensions will be made to prepare novel types of polymer nano-  composites.  In area 2 connected experimental and theoretical  studies will be made to develop a broader understanding of  wetting-induced reconstruction in surface-constrained chain  systems.  In area 3 the chain structure density distribution for  adsorbed polymers will be correlated with \"tuned\" substrate  pinning site patterns and topography, primarily made via  molecular self-assembly.  In addition, chain reorganization and  desorption dynamics will be studied via chemically-induced  interface perturbations and effects of chain confinement imposed  by chemisorbed molecular traps (\"staples\") on desorption kinetics  studied.  Overall these studies span flexible chain structure s,  ranging from solid nanocrystallites to disordered chain  assemblies, confined at chemically and topographically controlled  surfaces.  %%%  The results of the proposed work are expected to have impact in  areas ranging from polymer adhesion to microelectronics to  biocompatability.  They may provide an increased ability to make  quantitative models of the properties of complex organic  interfaces and thereby to enhance the ability to engineer  materials structures whose performance depends critically upon  the nature of these types of interfaces.  ***",
