Trivedi,  Department of Computer Science, Duke University, to  pursue  with  Professor  MyungWhan  Choi,  Department  of  Computer  Science  and Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul,  Korea,  for  24  months,  a  program  of  cooperative  research  on  performance  analysis methodology for the  future  wireless  communication  system.  The objective of this collaborative  research  project  is  to develop new performance  analysis  methodology  including Stochastic Reward Net (SRN)  models,  advanced  modeling  techniques, and a  model  specification  language.   New SRN models which are suitable  for  various  dynamic   channel  allocation  (DCA)  schemes  and  handoff  processes  will  be  developed.   These  advanced  modeling  techniques  will  handle  both non-Markovian  behavior  and  largeness  of  models arising from the  complexity  of  the  systems being modeled.    Efficient  handoff  is very important for  cellular  mobile  communication  systems  because  the  number  of   handoffs  increases as the cell size become smaller for high capacity  systems.   Designers  of  such systems  need  accurate  and  timely  performance analysis for the efficient  design  and  implementation  of future wireless communication  networks.  The  requested  support will allow the proposer's  research  group to interact with a group of researchers in Korea, who  have  similar research goals.  Both research groups have  a  long  history of research in performance analysis and  will  greatly benefit from the ability to collaborate through the  exchange  of junior and senior researchers.  This  research  adds an international dimension to an ongoing project under  NSF  Grant  No. EEC-9714965 which supports the  Center  for  Advanced    Computing    and    Communication,    an    NSF  Industry/University Cooperative Research  Center,  at  Duke  University.  This project is relevant to the objectives  of  the  U.S.-Korea Cooperative Scie nce Program which seeks  to  increase  the level of cooperation between U.S. and  Korean  scientists and engineers through the exchange of scientific  information,  ideas,  skills, and  techniques  and  through  collaboration on problems of mutual benefit.  This  project  will provide international training and experience for  two  U.S.  graduate students in an important area  of  research.  Korean participation is supported by the Korea Science  and  Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
