 "awd_abstract_narration": "The foci of this research are two fold.  First, synthesis will be used to   prepare  examples of small molecule receptors that precedent suggests   will be selective peptide binders and then screening them for binding   with combinatorial libraries of ca. ten thousand different tri- or   hexapeptides.  Receptor designs that show high sequence selectivity will   then be used as the basis of libraries of receptors. Second, new   simulation methodology will be developed to deal with the sampling   problem involved in averaging the populated states of a complex molecular   system, in particular, a molecular system having many distinct, low   energy forms or conformers.  The methods developed will be used to   predict relative binding free energies of different substrates for a   given receptor. With this renewal award, the Organic and Macromolecular   Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. W. Clark Still of the   Department of Chemistry at Columbia University.  Dr. Still will focus his   work on the design and preparation of synthetic, small molecule receptors   for complex biological and chemical substrates.  Such small molecule   receptors have potential value both in understanding the basis of   molecular recognition and in practical applications involving chemical   sensing, chemical separations and catalysis. The research employs two   different approaches: one experimental that uses combinatorial methods in   receptor design and one theoretical that involves calculations of free   energies.",
