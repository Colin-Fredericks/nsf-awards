 "awd_abstract_narration": "H. Eugene Stanley is funded by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to study cooperative molecular motions in   water.  The aim of the research is to conduct systematic studies of the   effects of the cooperative molecular motions on the properties of water   in an effort to understand: 1) power law singularities observed in the   thermodynamic response functions and relaxation times; 2) the shape of   phase boundaries in the phase diagram of water; and 3) anomalies found in   the propagation of sound through water.  A combination of molecular   dynamics simulations and formal theoretical modeling will be used to   develop a dynamical model of liquid water.  Molecular dynamics   calculations will use fast multipole methods on systems containing up to   a million water molecules using the Origin 2000 at Boston University. The   calculations will be performed with a parallelized code developed in   Stanley's research group.  Observable properties such as diffusivity,   spin lattice relaxation, dielectric function and dynamic structure   factors will be determined from the simulations for comparison with   experiment.  Stanley will collaborate with three experienced   experimentalists who will provide data to characterize a hypothesized   second critical point for water.  Water is an important fluid.  Although this substance has been the topic   of considerable research since the beginning of the century, its peculiar   properties are still not completely understood.  Although agreement has   not been reached on the origin of the anomalous properties of water, it   is commonly believed that a central role is played by the possibility for   the water molecule to form hydrogen bonds and to create a tetrahedrally   coordinated open network in both the solid and the liquid phases.    Stanley's research is directed at a fundamental molecular level   explanation for the anomalous behavior of this ubiquitous fluid",
