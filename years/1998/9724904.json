 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724904  Gallant    Under this U.S.-Australia cooperative research award, Dr.  Esther Gallant, Department of Veterinary Biology, University  of Minnesota, and Dr. Angela F. Dulhunty, John Curtin School  of Medical Research, Australian National University,  Canberra, will join forces to study the regulation of the  ryanodine receptor in skeletal muscle excitation-  contraction. Skeletal muscle excitation-contraction coupling  involves the interaction of two calcium channel proteins,  the dihydropyridine receptor and the ryanodine-receptor. A  short dihydropyradine peptide sequence is required for in  vivo excitation-contraction coupling and can substitute for  the dihydropyridine in ryanodine-receptor activation. The  investigators will record currents through ryanodine-  receptor channels inserted in artificial lipid bilayer  membranes to determine 1) concentrations of coproteins and  ligands necessary for optimal ryanodine-receptor function,  and 2) ryanodine-receptor activation by dihydropyridine  receptor peptides under these optimal conditions. The U.S.  and Australian investigators are experts in the area of  excitation-contraction coupling in muscle.  Both will  approach the study from different perspectives:  Prof.  Gallant has focused at the cellular and tissue level; while  Prof. Dulhunty has experience with the single-channel,  artificial bilayer technique.  Prof. Gallant will employ the  new knowledge gained in Australia to develop a similar  apparatus in Minnesota.  In addition, this project will  provide an opportunity for Dr. Gallant's graduate student to  participate in research in Australia.",
