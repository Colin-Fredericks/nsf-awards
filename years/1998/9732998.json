 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Anne McCoy of Ohio State University is supported by a CAREER   grant from the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to examine   theoretically the photodissociation and reaction dynamics of elementary   systems composed of several atoms.  A general approach will be developed   to approximate the quantum effects of large systems by treating a few   degrees of freedom quantum mechanically and the remainder of the system   classically.   This method will be applied to a number of systems where   detailed experimental data exist.  Novel educational ideas will be   incorporated into undergraduate and graduate courses, including   cooperative learning environments in lectures and recitations, and use of   the world wide web for information dissemination via course homepages.   By probing photodissociation and reaction dynamics under conditions where   comparisons to experiments can be made, an important step is made in the   connection between gas phase phenomena and more complicated chemistry   occuring in the condensed phase.  To make chemistry more relevant to   students, they will be actively encouraged to think about concepts and   their implications, rather than specific problem-solving techniques.",
