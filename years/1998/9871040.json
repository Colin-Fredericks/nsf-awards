 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funds are requested for instrumentation needed to  establish a Comprehensive Agricultural Genomics Laboratory  at Purdue University. Over the past five years, Purdue has  strengthened its capabilities in plant and microbial  genetics. The Purdue Genetics Program was founded and funded  by University resources and an NSF Training Grant in Plant  Genetics. Purdue now plans to expand this program with the  establishment of a comprehensive program in agricultural  genomics. Current instrumentation for genomic research runs  with a substantial backlog and there is great need to  enhance available resources to accommodate the expected  increase in demand as the program in agricultural genomics  expands.         The instrumentation to be purchased by the award falls  into three categories: (1) DNA sequence and analysis and  genome mapping; (2) informatics; and (3) functional  genomics. Funds will provide four DNA sequencers and  associated equipment; two Sparc computers; two micro array  machines and additional microscopes and support equipment.  This equipment will support analysis of the structure of  several plant and fungal genomes. Comprehensive cDNA cloning  of genes expressed in both pathogens and their plant hosts  will identify major components of these interactions.  Similar approach will be taken to study the molecular  genetics of secondary product synthesis, cell wall  development, cytoskeletal interactions or protein-DNA  interactions. Studies will also be initiated on microbial  diversity in standard versus polluted soils.",
