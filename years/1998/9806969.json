 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many parts of the world indigenous or minority ethnic communities are struggling with national states to preserve some local autonomy and identity.  This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology student at the University of Pittsburgh studies how an indigenous community in Nicaragua is involved in ethnic resistance, meaning the struggle against the national state for recognition of their cultural independence.  The hypotheses to be tested is that women have played an active role in ethnic struggles, even though their activities have not appeared in accounts.  By gathering and analyzing oral traditions, personal narratives and historical accounts of the community's struggle for ethnic rights and identity, the student will examine how the struggle for women's rights and identity has been intertwined with the larger political struggle. The methods include participant observation and extended interviews with community members.  The new knowledge to be created by this project will advance our understanding of how gender identity and ethnic identity intersect in indigenous communities.  In addition it will increase our knowledge about this important region of the world and contribute to the training of a young scientist.",
