 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725735  Owens    This grant provides partial support of the costs of upgrading the  University of South Carolina geophysics computer network.  Eight  existing Sun workstations (SUN SPARC 1's, SLC and LX's) purchased  between 1990 and 1994 will be upgraded to Ultra 1 configurations  and two existing servers to Ultra 2 configurations. Increased  computational speed and disk storage capacity will benefit  presently funded and planned computationally intensive research  programs in lithospheric seismology, GPS geodesy and  seismotectonics.  Additionally, increased disk storage capacity  will serve as archival support for the South Carolina Seismic  Network funded by the USGS and the DOE-Savannah River Site but  maintained by South Carolina geophysics faculty.  Recently funded  research (EAR-9706663) will require state-of-the-art processing  power and massive data storage for development of seismic models  of the lower mantle based on data collected from temporary  broadband regional networks.  Powerful graphics capabilities will  allow visualization of 3-D seismic models of the deep continental  structure of cratonic lithosphere in Tanzania inferred from  PASSCAL data and real-time visualization of geological time-scale  tectonic motions at convergent margins in Central and South  America calculated from campaign and permanent GPS data.  ***",
