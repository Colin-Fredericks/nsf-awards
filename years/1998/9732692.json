 "awd_abstract_narration": "The models used in inductive inference have their roots in the  models used by the philosophers of science who were discussing the  scientific method. The goal there, and in prior work in learning  theory, was to come up with an explanation of the phenomenon under  consideration. However, scientists rarely work directly for the  grand goal of a complete explanation, seeking rather the more  modest goal of finding features and facts about the observed data.  In like manner, this project pursues several modifications to the  traditional models used in inductive inference so as to study the  pursuit of more modest scientific goals.  This study is  particularly relevant to contemporary science as automated data  generation techniques produce sufficient volumes of data to  overwhelm the analysis abilities of humans. The goal of our work  is to illuminate precisely what can and cannot be accomplished by  automatic data analysis algorithms.",
