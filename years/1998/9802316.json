 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program,   Professor Thomas J. Katz, of the Department of Chemistry at Colmbia   University, explores the synthesis and self-assembly of helical   conjugated molecules.  Professor Katz is exploring the self-assembly of   helicenes into multimolecular aggregates of corkscrew-like structure.    These materials, which spontaneously organize in the form of fibers,   display an astonishing ability to rotate the plane of polarization of   plane polarized light.  Through development and exploitation of new and   versatile techniques for the synthesis of helicenes, Professor Katz   addresses the factors responsible for the aggregation of helical   conjugated molecules and the maximization of the rotatory power of these   aggregates, as well as the influence of aggregation on the circular   dichroism, optical activity, and morphologies of these materials.  Although `aromatic` compounds are typically planar, chemical synthesis   can be used to prepare aromatic structures which are more stable in a   helical conformation.  The synthesis and properties of such `helicenes`   are studied by Professor Thomas J. Katz, of the Department of Chemistry   at Columbia University, with the support of the Organic and   Macromolecular Chemistry Program.  Professor Katz is exploring the   self-assembly of helicenes into multimolecular aggregates of   corkscrew-like structure, which are found to assemble spontaneously in   the form of fibers.  These materials display unusual properties,   including a remarkable ability to alter the orientation of light which is   polarized in a single plane.  Through the synthesis of derivatives of the   helicenes bearing a variety of groups, Professor Katz explores the   fundamental factors controlling their chemistry and physical properties   as well as their use in the fabrication of new materials displaying new,   unusual, and significant properties.",
