 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804614  Sommer    Treasuring our Natural Heritage: Natural History and Environmental Science Education is a multifaceted project that will be developed by the Idaho Museum of Natural History. Their goal is to heighten an understanding of issues surrounding the concept of biodiversity among the general public.  By using the metaphor \" the economy of nature,\" they will present three concepts: biodiversity which will include the idea of keystone species, natural capital, and extinction debt & conservation biology.  This approach and the use of this metaphor is based on pre-exhibit research work that demonstrated that rural Idahoans understand this as a system of exchange, where each species holds a different 'occupation' and a variety of occupations is critical to the health of the economy.  This project will bring participants in touch with the value of scientific research through presentations by scientists whose recent research results will provide a deeper understanding of the living systems around them.  Views of elders from Idaho's Native American tribes will be included to add a critical human dimension.  With this award they will develop a series of three small traveling exhibits, three-part educational video series for public broadcasting, and three multimedia science kits for use by children's groups on each of the three concepts noted above.  With this multifaceted design it is anticipated that this program will reach 50% of Idaho's 1.2 million people.  It is anticipated that the exhibits will become generally available once they have completed their circulation in Idaho.",
