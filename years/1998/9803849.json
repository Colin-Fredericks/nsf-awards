 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803849  Many reasoning and specification tasks require the analysis of  logically complex syntactic objects. Such tasks arise, for  instance, in using typing systems, in describing and prototyping  programming languages, in effecting program transformations, in  demonstrating program correctness, in realizing theorem provers,  in describing the semantics of natural languages and in  constructing corresponding parsers for them.  A satisfactory  framework for performing such tasks is obtained from using lambda-  terms to represent the objects that are of interest and a  constructive logic to describe their properties. This research  addresses questions of implementation and use of lambda  Prolog, a programming language that provides such a framework.  The starting point for this work is an implementation of lambda  Prolog that embodies the first serious attempt to realize many of  its new features in an efficient manner. Using this system, the  project conducts an extensive empirical study of the impact on  efficiency of choices in the representation of lambda terms and  in the compilation of unification and other operations on these  terms. Refinements to the structure of lambda terms and to other  language features are considered towards understanding the  tradeoffs between efficiency and expressiveness. Issues relevant  to constructing a flexible programming system around the language  are studied. Finally, the strength of the programming system and  of the methods supported by it are tested by employing them to  implement a compiler for lambda Prolog.***",
