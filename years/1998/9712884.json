 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gregory Voth is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his theoretical development   of the Centroid Molecular Dynamics (CMD) technique, and to apply it to a   number of important problems in the area of condensed phase dynamics of   systems with quantum degrees of freedom.  The CMD method is based on   computing trajectories of Feynman path integral centroids using classical   molecular dynamics techniques.  The trajectories are then correlated and   statistically weighted with the phase space Feynman path integral   centroid density.  The resulting time correlation function can be related   by Fourier transform to the quantum time correlation function.  CMD   therefore allows quantum time correlation functions to be approximately   calculated with a numerical effort similar to a classical MD calculation.    Several applications will be investigated.  Proton translocation in   water and the diffusive transport of solvated and hydrated electrons will   be treated.  A second area of research involves the development of an   initial value semiclassical dynamics approach for condensed phase   systems.  This approach would allow the study of both nonequilibrium and   nonadiabatic processes, and treatment of nonlinear `system-bath`   interactions.  Finally, a formal treatment of activated quantum dynamics   will be undertaken to develop a new picture of the quantum mechanical   transition state.  Gas phase chemical systems have been studied for a number of years, and   excellent theoretical and computational techniques have been developed to   model their behavior. More recently theoretical and computational methods   are being developed that make it possible to treat more complex condensed   phase systems. Most of the current theoretical models are classical in   nature and cannot deal with the additional complications imposed by   quantum effects. Voth's research addresses this additional degree of   complexity and proposes the development of computational approaches   designed to permit the treatment of condensed phase systems that include   various quantum degrees of freedom.",
