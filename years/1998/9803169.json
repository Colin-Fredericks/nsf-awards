Ronnie Sircar    In financial mathematics, a methodology (due to Black and Scholes)  exists for pricing and hedging against the risk of derivative  securities (eg. options) on stocks when the volatility of the stock is  constant. However, it is widely believed that volatility has a random  component and must be described by a suitable stochastic model. This  project aims to produce a statistical description of stock volatility  dynamics using historical price data, and to combine it with an  asymptotic analysis of the partial differential equation for  derivative prices to infer the market's view of probable future stock  movements, and in particular, whether this view has become more  pessimistic since the 1987 crash. The analysis will exploit the  discrepancy in time-scales of fluctuation between the Brownian motion  driving the stock price process and the volatility stochastic process.    The spectacular growth in the size of the derivatives market over the  last twenty years (currently it has a turnover of trillions of dollars  in the US) plus recent infamous (and equally spectacular) risk  (mis)management disasters such as the Barings and Orange County  fiascos, have created an urgent need for good mathematical and  computational models to quantify the respective risks and rewards of  such investments. This project aims to build on the Nobel Prize  winning methodology of Black, Scholes and Merton, to take into account  the fluctuating nature of market volatility. Mathematical tools are  combined with statistical analysis of past prices to produce formulas  and software that accurately capture the potential losses and gains in  today's vast derivative market.",
