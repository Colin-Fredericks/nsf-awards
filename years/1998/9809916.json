 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental light levels can be detected by systems other  than the eye in non-mammalian vertebrates.  These extra-retinal  photoreceptors often are used by non-mammalian vertebrates to  synchronize biological rhythms, and to control rapid changes in  skin pigmentation for camouflage.  The photopigment in the retina  of the eye in vertebrates includes proteins called opsins, but the  photopigments for this extra-retinal light sensitivity are  unknown.  Recently a new opsin protein molecule in the brain, skin  and eye of frogs has been found, and is named melanopsin because  it was isolated from the pigment cells in the skin called  melanophores.  This collaborative research project uses techniques  of gene expression and molecular biology along with microscopy and  immunochemistry to see how light interacts with the expression of  the melanopsin in frogs.  Tests will show whether melanopsin  expression is required for the camouflage response of pigment  dispersion in the melanophores, and whether melanopsin expression  is required for light to suppress the output of the hormone  melatonin from the pineal gland of the brain, which is important  for photic control of biological rhythms.  Transgenic tissues will  be tested to see whether those that over-express melanopsin are  hypersensitive to light while those with under-expression are  insensitive to light.     Results will be important for understanding how animals respond  to light without relying only upon the eyes, and will have a broad  impact not only on neuroendocrinology and sensory biology, but on  cell phyisiology and behavioral biology, and comparisons of  molecular structure could be important to evolutionary biology.",
