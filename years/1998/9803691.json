 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803691  Gaffney       Gaffney studies the local geometry of analytic sets and mappings.  His  goal is to find numbers computable from the equations defining the sets or  components of the mappings that will describe the geometry of the object  under study.  A first step is to find numbers of this type whose constancy in  a family of objects implies that the geometry of the family is constant in  some well-defined way.  One of the most important conditions that Gaffney  considers is Whitney equisingularity.  This condition implies that the  embedded topology of the family is constant.  The theory of the integral  closure of modules provides a powerful framework for studying this condition.  Working with Kleiman, Gaffney will solve this problem for families of  complete intersections with non-isolated singularities.  This will be done by  transporting, with suitable modifications, the ideas Gaffney used in the case  of hypersurfaces with non-isolated singularities into the framework of  complete intersections developed with Kleiman.  Gaffney will also investigate  the relation between the geometry of hypersurface singularities and the  components appearing in the exceptional divisor associated to these  singularities.  One specific case to be considered will be discriminants of  finitely determined map germs and topologically stable map germs close to the  boundary of the nice dimensions.  This study will be a step toward criteria  for families of such maps to be Whitney equisingular.        This project is part of a centuries old effort to fathom the geometry  of mappings and singular shapes.  (A mapping is a relation between shapes.)  A cone is a simple example of a shape with a singularity, and a picture of a  cone is a simple example of a mapping.  The picture creates a relation  between the points of the cone and the points of a plane, the plane of the  picture in this case.  If we take a picture of even a smooth shape, the image  will have edges, and the edges will also often have singula r points, so the  study of shapes and mappings are related.  Equations describe shapes.  The  goal of this study is to start with equations of a shape and extract numbers  from them that give a description of the geometry of the shape useful for  determining when one member of a family of shapes is different from other  members.  For example, if you lay a piece of string across itself, it forms a  loop.  As you pull the loop tight, it forms a family of curves, and the loop  disappears at some time t.  Our intuition says that the curves in this family  are similar until we get to time t, when the loop disappears.  We can write  down equations for the members of this family.  It is helpful to study this  situation using two scales.  There is the macroscopic level, in which the  individual curves bend to form loops, and there is also an infinitesimal  level at which the tangent vectors to the curves and to the union of the  curves exist.  As you move around a loop, you can follow the tangent vectors  around.  Remarkably, although the loop disappears as time goes to t at the  macroscopic level, the loop leaves a trace at the infinitesimal level.  This  trace shows up in the invariant, called the Milnor number, that we use to  study curves in the plane, and it can be calculated from equations of the  curves.  The theory of integral closure of modules is a powerful framework  for studying sets at this infinitesimal level and for extracting numbers that  detect change at this level in a family of sets.  Because there is a good  connection between algebra and geometry for shapes defined in complex space  by analytic functions, this is the setting for most work to date using this  approach.  d-dimensional subsets of complex n-space defined by n-d equations  are called complete intersections.  Gaffney and Kleiman will combine their  own and others' earlier approaches to more limited situations to treat  families of complete intersections with singular sets of arbitrary dimension.  ***",
