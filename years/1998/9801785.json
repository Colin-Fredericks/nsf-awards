 "awd_abstract_narration": "9801785  MITCHELL  There is now strong evidence that ultraviolet (UV) radiation  is increasing over certain locations in Antarctica and the  Southern Ocean as a result of ozone depletion. A reduction  in ozone concentration selectively limits stratospheric  adsorption of UV radiation and results in a higher UV  irradiance reaching the earth's surface. Research on the  impact of increased UV radiation due to ozone depletion has  focused primarily on phytoplankton, with a much smaller  effort being directed to other trophic levels. This  collaborative project will address UV radiation induced  damage and UV radiation effects on bacterioplankton. Studies  will examine interactions between bacterioplankton and  photochemical processes and interactions with higher trophic  groups such as phytoplankton and zooplankton. Topics to be  addressed will include whether bacterial-phytoplankton  coupling modifies bacterial response to UV radiation, how  seasonal changes in UV radiation affect bacterial community  dynamics and how chemical photoproducts impact bacterial  production.. This research project will elucidate the  molecular determinants responsible for changes in  productivity and the molecular and physiological responses  to changing UV radiation. The overall goal is to provide a  greater understanding of the potential impact that changes  in UV radiation have on marine microbial communities.",
