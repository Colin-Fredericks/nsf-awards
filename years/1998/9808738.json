 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nDBI 9808738; Jacobs, Gwen; Montana State University\r\n\r\nNeuroSys is a prototype database developed under prior NSF funding which contains \r\ninformation about the anatomy and functional attributes of neurons. NeuroSys also \r\ncontains information about measured and hypothetical relations between neurons. In \r\naddition an advanced visualization program for dynamic synthesis and animation of \r\nensemble activity patterns has been integrated into this database environment. Finally, an \r\nadvanced neural simulation program has also been integrated with this environment. \r\nThrough the use of these advanced query and analysis tools, it is now possible to \r\nformulate queries which predict dynamic activity patterns of large neuronal ensembles \r\nacross multiple processing stages within an animal's nervous system. These features \r\nelevate the utility of the database far beyond that of a sophisticated data repository, and \r\nprovide an enabling tool for the formulation of hypotheses related to neural computation, \r\nplasticity and development. The general goals of this work are to extend the capabilities, \r\ntransportability and general utility of this prototype system, and to distribute this system to \r\nall interested researchers in the neuroscience community. Specific aims are as follows:\r\n\r\n\u00d1\tThe functionality of the graphical user interface and its links to data analysis programs \r\nwill be enhanced by modification of the architecture to accommodate distributed data \r\nand new software tools more effectively, and to allow users to conduct complex queries \r\nwithout affecting the data of other users. \r\n\r\n\u00d1\tThe data acquisition, analysis and query tools will be enhanced to accommodate several \r\nnew data types, including a) Voxel-based representations of individual neurons and/or \r\nobjects as density clouds derived from confocal microscope images, b) time-series data \r\ngenerated from single and multi-electrode recordings, and c) surface-rendered and vol-\r\nume-rendered structures derived from microscope images of objects traced from sec-\r\ntioned tissue samples. \r\n\r\n\u00d1\tA link will be created between the database/workspace environment and three popular \r\nneural modeling programs.\r\n\r\n\u00d1\tNew software tools will be implemented to facilitate the configuration of the system for \r\nother users. Those tools will include a program to generate and customize the query \r\ninterface/GUI, and a program to generate database tables from a set of user-defined \r\ninputs\r\n\r\n\u00d1\tThe user base will be extended to the general neuroscience research community. As \r\npart of this process, the system will be validated through a beta test program, the stabil-\r\nity and transportability of the tools across several hardware and software platforms will \r\nbe increased, and an interface will be developed for web-based access and data entry. \r\n\r\n\u00d1\tThe current multi-disciplinary training environment for bioinformatics at Montana \r\nState University will be supported and extended, through directed and independent \r\nresearch projects based on aspects of the project. A set of coursework modules will then \r\nbe\r\n\r\n\u00d1\tdeveloped for classroom use via a Java-based web interface to the database and tools. \r\nThese modules will be used in a number of courses locally, and will be made available \r\nto the general public via the web.\r\n\r\nThis project will be carried out as a coordinated effort between two sets of neuroscience \r\nand computer science researchers: one group at MSU and the other group at UCSD. This \r\nproject is a core component in the NPACI Neuroscience Thrust Area, and will leverage on \r\na wealth of technical expertise and computer resources at the San Diego center.\r\n\r\n",
