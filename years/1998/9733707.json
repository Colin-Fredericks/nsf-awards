 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733707  Goldman    This CAREER project bridges atoms to devices striving to link  basic materials science with technology. Direct correlations  between atomic scale processes occurring during epitaxial growth  and electronic properties will be investigated using a  combination of epitaxial growth, in-situ and ex-situ  measurements. The P.I. will develop a series of laboratory  modules in electronic materials which parallel these basic  investigations, and incorporate them into undergraduate courses.  Initial systems for study include InAs-based films and  heterostructures whose high electron mobility and surface  accumulation make them promising as magnetic field sensors for  automotive applications. This project will investigate how  details of atom attachment on a surface affect the electron  mobility of a thin film, and its resulting performance as a  magnetic field sensor. Graduate students will be exposed to  research spanning fundamental materials science to applied  aspects. Undergraduate students will actively participate in the  design, construction, and utilization of electronic and magnetic  measurement systems, which will serve as prototypes for  undergraduate laboratory modules to develop studentsO  experimental and analytical skills, and to enhance learning  through discovery.  %%%  The project addresses fundamental research issues in a topical  area of materials science having high technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at  a fundamental level to important aspects of electronic materials  and advanced devices. An important feature of the program is the  emphasis on education, and on the integration of research and  education through the training of students in a fundamentally and  technologically significant research area.  ***",
