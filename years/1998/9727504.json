 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the dissertation research of an anthropology student from the University of Iowa.  The research investigates the effect of particular religious affiliation has on the political activity of women in the Solomon Islands.  While religious Christian doctrine stresses modernization over traditional customs, there is variation in how different religious organizations stimulate or suppress the political activities of women.  The project will investigate how the religious Christian doctrines that women are learning through affiliation with Catholic, Anglican, Methodist, Evangelical, Adventist, Pentecostal and other denominations relate to their involvement with social change organizations such as NGOs.  The student will interview women and their husbands or other adult male relatives who are activists, as well as those who are not activists.  Participant observation and focus groups will serve to discover variations in beliefs and activities, and archival information will provide historical context on missionary activities.  This research is important because it will advance our understanding of the sources of activism in a community where women have historically been inactive in political change.  The project will also advance our knowledge about this important region of the world.",
