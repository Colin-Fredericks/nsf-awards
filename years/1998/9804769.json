Support for this grant is shared between the Earth  Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program (EAR/IF) and  Purdue University (50%).  The new XRD will replace an old and  obsolete XRD and will be installed in the fully climate-  controlled X-ray laboratory in the Civil Engineering Building at  Purdue University.  Several faculty members and their research  groups will be using the new equipment in studies on a wide range  of topics:  Dr. R. Giere for mineralogical and petrologic  investigations of various metamorphic rocks, characterization of  crystalline waste forms for municipal and high-level nuclear  waste, and for research projects in experimental petrology;  Dr.  S.J. Fritz for determination of clay minerals and other phases in  soils and weathering horizons, and for examination of  precipitates produced during leaching of coal piles;  Dr. K.D.  Ridgway for characterization of shales, volcanic ashes and tuffs,  and other fine-grained rocks in sedimentary basins;  Dr. R.O.  Sack for identification and characterization of starting  materials and run products consumed or produced during petrologic  experiments;  and Dr. J.M. Harbor for provenance studies of fine-  grained glacial deposits, and in environmental studies, for  mineralogical identification of non-point source pollutants.  The  new X-ray diffractometer will also be utilized for teaching  purposes.  The Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences  provides a research-intensive learning environment, where  undergraduate students are required to learn various types of  analytical methods, including X-ray diffraction, during their  course work.  ***",
