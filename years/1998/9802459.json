Parker on gluing   formulas for the Gromov invariants of symplectic connect sums.  We have   been working on a degeneration formula that describes what happens to   holomorphic curves as one `pinches the neck' and explains how to compute   the Gromov invariants of the symplectic connect sum from the limiting   curves.  This degeneration formula has several applications that we would   like to explore.  First, one can construct new `exotic' symplectic   manifolds by cut-and-paste techniques and compute their Gromov invariants   by the degeneration formula.  This gives a practical technique for probing   how much more complicated the symplectic classification of manifolds is   compared to the smooth classification.  Secondly, the degeneration formula   leads to recursive formulas for the Gromov invariants; these could provide   answers to several old unsolved problems in enumerative algebraic geometry.    The final project suggests a method for extending Gromov-type invariants to   `nongeneric' situations.  This would provide more refined information about   the symplectic manifold.      Most of the problems in enumerative algebraic geometry are more than a   hundred years old.  The questions are easy to ask, but the progress in   solving them using classical methods has been quite slow.  Recently, the   same kind of questions arised in two dimensional topological quantuum field   theories from high energy physics.  Inspired by these theories, new methods   lead in the past couple of years to amazing progress in the field.  The   proposal explores two new ways of approaching these old problems that would   further clarify the structure of the two dimensional topological quantuum   field theories.",
