 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the synthesis of effective algebraic  and numerical algorithms and on their practical and theoretical  improvement.  This includes the comprehensive study of practical  numerical algorithms for polynomial rootfinding, which is a  central subject of algebraic computing.  The study should include  many technical novelties.  Another fundamental subject covered by  the project and having ubiquitous applications to many areas of  scientific and engineering computing and signal processing is the  computations with structured matrices.  The project also includes  various extensions and applications of polynomial rootfinding and  structured matrices, in particular to approximating polynomial  gcd, to polynomial interpolation and multipoint evaluation, and  to solving polynomial systems of equations.  The work also  applies to sign determination and modular reduction, which is a  central subject of algebraic and  geometric computations, and on decoding the BCH error-correcting  codes, in particular Reed-Solomon codes most important in  practice.",
