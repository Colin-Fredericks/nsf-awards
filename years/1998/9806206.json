Numerous lines of evidence  suggest that the production (\"expression\") of the proteins  (\"receptors\") of nerve cells (neurons) which are responsible for  sensitivity to the messenger molecules (\"neurotransmitters\")  through  which neurons communicate is essential for proper  synapses to grow.  Thus understanding what regulates this receptor  expression if important for understanding how the nervous system  gets wired up.  Dr. Melnikova will study certain components  (called \"subunits\") of one of the more important neurotransmitter  receptors, that responsible for the sensitivity to the chemical  \"acetylcholine.\"  She will determine which molecules inside the  cell (\"transcriptional regulatory units\") are responsible for  regulating the production of the receptor subunits, and how  exactly they operate within the cell nucleus.  This POWRE award  will promote Dr. Melnikova's career as a research scientist by  allowing her to learn the molecular biological techniques needed  for studies of gene expression, key techniques in a key area of  current research.",
