 "awd_abstract_narration": "David Beratan is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to study response properties of   biomolecules including electron transfer reactions and Raman   spectroscopic probes of chirality.  The goal of the proposed work is to   develop a general new tool that will enable the theoretical exploration   of biochemical structure-function and reactivity relations by exploiting   the local nature of chemical interactions.  An ab initio   divide-and-conquer method is proposed, tailored to describe the   electronic and vibronic response properties of macromolecules.  The   methods will be developed in such a way that they can be used to: 1)   establish a link between 3D structure and electron transfer rates in   proteins and DNA; 2)  assist in relating molecular structure to   chiroptical properties critical for drug discovery and protein structure   determination, and 3) expand the structure-property interpretations of   proteins available via Raman spectroscopy.  The actual implementation of   this strategy involves the use of an effective Hamiltonian, and Greens   function theory to determine the relevant response function.  A quantitative molecular-level description of biological function will   arise from a detailed description of macromolecular electronic and   vibronic structure.  Yet, reliable electronic structure calculations are   possible on systems of only modest size.  Beratan's research program will   enable the theoretical exploration of biochemical structure-function and   reactivity relations at the molecular level for macromolecular systems of   biological interest.",
