 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project relates to the research of proton exchange membranes (PEM's).  The project proposes to develop a new class of PEM's based on polyphenylene polymers by exploring the structure/proton-conductivity relationship.  These new PEM's are designed to overcome problems encountered with conventional PEM's at temperatures above100(C, and are expected to have better performance at ambient temperatures at much lower cost.  Current PEM's require condensed water to attain useful conductivity at temperatures above the boiling point at which time the PEM dries out and conductivity drops drastically.  High temperature is preferred for optimal performance of state-of-the-art oxidation catalyst systems.  Recently, Maxdem has conducted some preliminary studies of polyphenylene PEM's and demonstrated the outstanding properties of these materials for proton conductivity.  The conductivity of some of these materials is much higher than Naflon membranes, even at high temperature.  Further investigation in structure/proton conductivity relationship is expected to provide PEM's for practical fuel cell applications with unmatched performance at lower costs.  The novel proposed electrolytes would allow major advances in fuel cells.  Lightweight, high energy density fuel cells are needed for powering electric vehicles and for man-portable applications.  Both defense and civilian applications present lager potential markets.",
