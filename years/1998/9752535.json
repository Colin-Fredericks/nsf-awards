 "awd_abstract_narration": "This innovative general chemistry laboratory development project seeks to   transform the traditional approach to laboratory. Open-ended labs covering multiple weeks are conducted with methodology created by the students as the labs proceed. Environmental and biological applications are used to enhance the interest of the students. Data is collected on each student's Texas Instrument TI-83 calculator using the lab's calculator based laboratory (CBL) system and instrument probes. Real-time data analysis determines the quality of the data and the need for further analyses.    Four laboratory investigations are conducted each semester.  Each involves a variety of topics included in the traditional single-week lab approach so that all of the important concepts generally included in first year labs are addressed.  The topics for this project include: a) Internet and Web searches, b) chemical and physical properties of ten environmentally important chemicals, c) water, water everywhere, d) properties of liquids and gases, e) properties of solutions, f) vitamin chemistry, g) a kinetics study, and h) a four week research project.     The emphasis on non-\"cookbook\" chemistry should stimulate the student's creativity and ability to formulate and carry out self-designed scientific investigations. A final research project involving concepts learned in the beginning labs is used to investigate a problem that is of interest to the student.  The goal of this project is to create interesting, relevant laboratories that will lead to a better understanding of chemistry as well as  the methodology of science.",
