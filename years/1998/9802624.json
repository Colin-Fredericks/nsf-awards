Dr.  Hurley will work with Dr. Wright in the Department of  Applied Physics on a research project entitled,  \"Investigation of Quantum Dynamics of Coherent Phonon  Generation in Semiconductor Nanostructures.\"    The proposed research is aimed at essential basic studies of  the coherent phonon generation in semiconductor films and  nanostructures.  In the past thirty years, the optical  generation and detection of lattice vibrations (phonons)  using laser pulsed excitation has been utilized to probe  macroscopic and microscopic material properties.  In  particular, ultrafast generation using laser pulses with  extremely narrow temporal profiles (pulse width~100fs) has  been used to study the dynamics of photo-excited non-  equilibrium carriers and phonon propagation, in  semiconductor film and nanostructures.  Despite growing  interest from many groups in this area there are still  significant gaps in our knowledge of phonon generation and  detection mechanisms in these materials.  For example, the  ultrafast generation mechanisms in direct band gap  semiconductor samples, as basic as single layer GaAs, have  not been studied experimentally.  This groundwork will pave  the way for the investigation of generation and propagation  of coherent phonons in geometries relevant to heat transport  and carrier relaxation in nanoscale electronics or  optoelectronic devices such as semiconductor lasers.  ***",
