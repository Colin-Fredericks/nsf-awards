North Carolina State University    CISE PostDoc:  Verification Tool for Net-based Programming    This project is devoted to the development of effective automated techniques for modeling and reasoning about the correctness of network-based software. The motivation for the project arises from the exploding popularity of programming in net-based languages like Java coupled with the fact that an incorrectly functioning net-oriented program can inflict serious damage on a whole network and not just on a single site within the network.  The methods to be used by the research effort are based on those used successfully in the analysis of finite-state systems such as communications protocols and in the rigorous modeling of   programming language constructs.  The PI has substantial experience in the former but very little with the latter; the addition of a postdoctoral research associate with a background in the latter is therefore essential for the project's anticipated results---a collection of techniques, and associated tools, for analyzing automatically the safety and fault-tolerance of mobile code---to be achieved.",
