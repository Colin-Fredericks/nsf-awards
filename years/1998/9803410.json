 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803410  Pittel   The investigator will study a series of interrelated problems in asymptotic   enumeration and combinatorial probability. The goal is to analyze likely and unlikely   behavior of large combinatorial structures such as random graphs, trees, permutations, and   partitions of sets and integers. This research will develop new approaches based on   combinatorial-algebraic principles and ideas and analytical methods of probability and   random processes.   The connection between combinatorics and probability is well known. It played a   major role in the early stages of development of probability theory, and some classical   problems of a combinatorial nature are traditionally used to illustrate how the general   theorems work in application to combinatorics. Among them are random walks and   allocations of particles among cells (boxes), the latter being quite popular in various   models of statistical mechanics. During the last 30-35 years, there has been a tremendous   outpouring of research in combinatorial probability motivated by new problems in   statistical mechanics (percolation theory, for instance), polymerization theory, computer   science (probabilistic analysis of combinatorial algorithms), population genetics, etc. The   terms random permutations, mappings, graphs, partitions, etc. have become household   names for many researchers who have discovered the importance of analysis of random   combinatorial structures. The related theory of random graphs, inaugurated by Erdos and   Renyi in the early sixties, has been found indispensable in many important applications.   Characteristically, the deepest results have come via a combination of fine combinatorial   techniques and powerful probabilistic methods. Besides the problems directly related to   random graphs, the investigator will study an optimal assignment problem with random   costs, a possible connection between the evolving random graph and the Diaconis-   Shahshahani algorithm (\"card shuffling\") for generating a r andom permutation, and   various problems on random partitions of sets and integers. The accent will be made on   searching for probabilistic and analytic methods which can be used for other combinatorial   structures important in applications.",
