 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731228  Marean & Assefa    This dissertation enhancement grants supports a graduate  student, Mr. Zelalem Assefa, working under the guidance of  Dr. Curtis Marean, Associate Professor of Anthropology at the  State University of New York at Stony Brook, to do field  research in Ethiopia.  East Africa is a region that contains  significant information about the evolutionary history of the  origin of modern humans.  Biological and cultural evidence  has shown that the Middle Stone Age (MSA) or Middle  Paleolithic was an important period in the formative phase of  modern behavior of early modern peoples.  But examination of  the subsistence models used by early modern humans in these  periods has provided contradictory explanations about their  resource exploitation behaviors.  Mr. Assefa hypothesizes  that the early appearance of the MSA in Africa is related to  adaptive adjustments early modern humans made during the arid  and cold phases of the Late Middle and Upper Pleistocene, and  that they developed their seasonal exploitation of resources  (vegetation and prey animals) into a  subsistence strategy  during the late MSA in East Africa.  The role of hunting may  have been one of the factors responsible for the observed  technological shift in the MSA, and if so Mr. Assefa also  hypothesizes that it will predict major changes in the  taphonomic features of faunal remains between late Acheulean  and early MSA assemblages.  The results of this project will  determine if the trajectory for behavioral evolution was the  same in both Africa and Europe. This project will test  subsistence models that are developed from analyses of faunal  specimens from different parts of the Old World and Ethiopia  with the MSA record, for the purpose of identifying and  analyzing any contradictions among the models.  The  methodological approaches of GIS-based ecological analysis  and taphonomic investigation will be used to collect data  from fauna and ecological specimens from the Garba III and  Porc-epic sites.   Staff members at The National Museum of  Ethiopia will collaborate with Mr. Assefa on this project.    These results will provide important new information on the  behavioral history of the early modern humans in East Africa.  The new set of data will also provide a valuable reference  resource for other archeological projects in East Africa.  Additionally, the grant will provide support to enable a  promising student to establish a strong, independent research  career.    The Division of International Programs and the Division of  Social, Behavioral and Economic Research are jointly  providing funding for this project.",
