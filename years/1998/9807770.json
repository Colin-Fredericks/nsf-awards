 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tDuring the last decade, considerable progress has been made in determining the basic physical processes that govern ocean-atmosphere interaction in the Pacific Ocean and that are responsible for the slowly modulation El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO).  To a significant degree, the extent to which warm and cold events influence global climate has been assessed, including the variability of that influence from event to event.  The questions arise:  is it possible to achieve the same degree of success with respect to predictions of the Asian-Australian monsoon variability and its global climate influence?\r\n\r\n\tA workshop will be held this summer (1998) to assess the potential for improved monsoon prediction and its impacts.  The workshop will involve scientists with expertise in meteorology, climate, oceanography, and land surface processes.  The specific objectives include:\r\n\r\n* Assessing the status of knowledge of the variability and predictability of the Asian-Australian monsoon on time-scales from intraseasonal to interannual\r\n* Assessing current abilities to model the monsoon system in stand-alone ocean and atmospheric models as well as coupled models\r\n* Developing a strategy for advancing understanding of the monsoon system and its predictability\r\n\r\nA report of findings and recommendations will be produced and made widely available to the community.\r\n\r\nThe Divisions of Atmospheric and Oceans Sciences at NSF as well as NOAA and NASA are sharing in the support for this award.\r\n",
