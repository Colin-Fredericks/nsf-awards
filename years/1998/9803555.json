We will also\r\nstudy effects of reaction and diffusion on the motion of particles in\r\nthese flows, properties of chaotic advection in general, and particular\r\nmodels of great relevance in engineering applications: flows between\r\nconcentric and eccentric rotating  cylinders. These problems will be\r\naddressed starting from our recent developments in geometric theory of\r\nthree-dimensional divergence-free vector fields.  The issues of\r\ncantori, resonances and lobe dynamics in volume-preserving  maps and\r\nflows will be addressed through theoretical analysis and computer\r\nsimulation.  Connection with experiments on mixing in three-dimensional\r\nflows will be made.  Effects of inertia and viscosity on chaotic mixing\r\nwill be studied via asymptotic, large Reynolds number analysis in\r\nconjunction with the transport theory of dynamical systems. This will\r\nallow for  discussion of the change of mixing properties of laminar,\r\nincompressible, viscous flows with the change of the  Reynolds number.\r\nFurther, we will study the effects of molecular diffusion on chaotic\r\nadvection based on the perturbative multiple-scales method combined\r\nwith ergodic theory, and through numerical simulations. We will\r\ninvestigate a  general relationship between the pure advection problem\r\n(possibly with chaotic mixing) and the full advection-diffusion\r\nproblem. We will study reaction-diffusion-advection equations through\r\nthe combination of tools mentioned before. We shall pursue nonlinear\r\nstability analysis in search of effects of chaotic advection on\r\nstability. The particular examples we will be studying are flows\r\nbetween concentric rotating cylinders. Compressible flows received\r\nvirtually no attention in chaotic advection studies. We propose to\r\nremedy this situation by pursuing a basic study of this problem.\r\nSimple model flows  will be identified starting with  a compressible\r\nvortex flow in a cylindrical container. Comparison with the behavior of\r\nincompressible flows will be pursued.\r\n\r\nThe above study is useful in a variety of technological contexts. There\r\nis a recent surge of interest in micro- and nano-scale technology that\r\nposes a number of mathematical  challenges. For example, flows in\r\ndevices such as large mixers and combustion chambers are designed to\r\nmix well by moving the flow in a turbulent regime and thus causing\r\nenhanced mixing by rapid random movements of fluid in the flow. This is\r\nnot possible in microscopic devices. The process of mixing needs to be\r\nunderstood much better in order to design microscopic mixers,\r\ncombustion chambers etc.  necessary as the building block of\r\nmicroscopic processing devices and microengines. The mixing  process in\r\nsuch devices is typically three-dimensional. Thus, the design of\r\nmicroscopic mixing devices will benefit from the fundamental study of\r\nthree-dimensional mixing processes outlined above. In addition, the\r\nperformance of macroscopic devices  is challenged by new requirements\r\non the levels of environmental chemical pollution (NO_x) and sound\r\npollution.  The improvement in the design of these devices will be based\r\non a better understanding of the underlying mixing processes. The above\r\nstudy will provide some of the crucial concepts for such design by\r\nunraveling the fundamentals of mixing in three-dimensional flows and\r\nusing these concepts to study the effect of mixing on combustion and\r\nnoise production.\r\n\r\n",
