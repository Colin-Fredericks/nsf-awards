 "awd_abstract_narration": "9811585  Dede    A series of four EHR-related projects will be selected by the principal investigators and EHR's Technology Integration in Education (TIE) committee for presentation at two sessions of the National Educational Computing Conference (NECC) in Dan Diego, CA on June 23, 1998.  In addition two sessions will be presented by two of the Collaborative Research on Learning Technologies (CRLT) Centers-Center for Innovative Learning Technologies (CILT) and Center for the Transfer of Technology to Urban Schools.    The Annual NECC is an excellent venue for interconnecting NSF-sponsored researchers in educational technology with teacher, administrators, and higher educators interested in the mission of the centers and project topics.  The venue will advance recent initiatives by REC and EHR by providing formative feedback from practitioners and informing the K-16 educational technology community about four EHR project and the Centers and the new types of opportunities they offer.    The principal investigators will arrange and coordinate the sessions, serve as moderators for all sessions to provide an integrated flow of ideas, and prepare a final report that summarizes the result and lessons learned from this project.  The NECC '98 conference committee will specially feature the four sessions.  ***",
