 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emotions reflect an appraisal of situations, and they help people to respond to situations in particular ways.   However, appraisals may be modified, and emotional response tendencies may be overridden. These emotion regulatory processes permit people to manage their emotions, to influence which emotions they have, and to choose how these emotions are expressed. Such emotion regulation is essential to healthy adaptation, and so pervasive that it is often taken for granted. Emotion regulation clearly has consequences for the person who is doing the regulating, but it also may have important consequences for others. The current project examines the social consequences of two important forms of emotion regulation. The first, antecedent-focused emotion regulation, is exemplified by reappraisal, in which one reinterprets one's situation so as to reduce its emotional impact. The second, response-focused emotion regulation, is exemplified by suppression, in which one inhibits emotion-expressive behavior. Behavioral, physiological, and self-report measures will be used to examine the social consequences of reappraisal and suppression. The long-term objective is to better understand the nature and consequences of emotion regulation. Such research could have important implications for understanding emotion and emotion regulation, and will lay the foundation for interventions promoting healthy forms of emotion regulation.                                                     \u255d\u00c1/\u00a2\u00c1 \u2510>\u2524\u00c1\u255d\u00a2\u00a5/>\u2524\u2563>\u00c0 ?\u00c2 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u00c2/\u2502\u00a5?\u255d\u00a2 \u00a5\u00a9/\u00a5 /\u00c2\u00c2\u00c1\u2502\u00a5 \u2551\u00c1?\u2551%\u00c1 \u00a2 \u2534\u2563%%\u2563>\u00c0>\u00c1\u00a2\u00a2 />\u2524 /\u2593\u2563%\u2563\u00a5` \u00a5? \u2502?>\u00c2\u255d?>\u00a5 >\u00c1\u00c0/\u00a5\u2563\u2514\u00c1 \u2563>\u00c2?\u255d_/\u00a5\u2563?> />\u2524 \u00a5? \u00a9\u2563\u00c0\u00a9%\u2563\u00c0\u00a9\u00a5 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u255d?%\u00c1 ?\u00c2 \u2551?\u00a2\u2563\u00a5\u2563\u2514\u00c1 \u00c2\u00c1\u00c1%\u2563>\u00c0\u00a2 />\u2524 \u2593\u00c1%\u2563\u00c1\u00c2\u00a2 \u2563> \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 _/>/\u00c0\u00c1_\u00c1>\u00a5 ?\u00c2 >\u00c1\u00c0/\u00a5\u2563\u2514\u00c1 \u00c1\u2514\u00c1>\u00a5\u00a2 />\u2524 \u2563>\u00c2?\u255d_/\u00a5\u2563?>",
