 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812422  Phillips  This is a theoretical grant funded jointly by the Divisions  of Materials Research and Chemistry.  The research focuses  on three topics: the unusual phase transition in the dilute  two-dimensional electron gas; transport in electrides; and,  disorder in the Kondo effect.    When electrons are confined to move in a plane, localization  as well as electron correlations are enhanced.  This grant  focuses on three distinct physical realizations of spatially  confined electron systems in which the transport properties  are fundamentally linked to localization, electron  interaction, or an interplay between the two.  In the first  system, the focus is on the recent experiments of Kravchenko  and colleagues which provide convincing evidence for the  existence of a conducting state in a dilute 2D electron gas.  These experiments are surprising as it had been previously  thought that disorder precludes the presence of metallic  conduction in 2D.  In this work, the possibility that the  experimentally-observed transition corresponds to the  melting of a Wigner crystal is explored.  We propose that  when a Wigner crystal melts, the melted liquid state  superconducts.  A series of analytical and numerical  approaches are discussed to test this proposal.    In the second problem, we focus on the interplay between  magnetism and disorder in the electride conductor K  +(cryptand 2.2.2 )e -.  Electrides are a class of organic  conductors in which the anion is an electron.  The key  features that lead to the complexity of the transport and  magnetic proerties of this system are the presence of spin  singlet electron pairs localized in cavities without the  concomitant spin gap, but instead a surprising charge gap.  We argue that a model with long range magnetic interactions  can explain the transport properties of this system.    Finally, experiments by Giordano and co-workers show that in  thin metallic films, weak-localization physics can couple to  Kondo spin-flip scattering.  A scaling an alysis as well as a  calculation of the magnetoresistance will be done as  extensions of previous work on the feedback effect played by  non-magnetic scattering on the Kondo effect.  %%%  This is a theoretical grant funded jointly by the Divisions  of Materials Research and Chemistry.  The research focuses  on three topics: the unusual phase transition in the dilute  two-dimensional electron gas; transport in electrides; and,  disorder in the Kondo effect.  All three problems have in  common the competition between electron interactions and the  confinement of electrons to one-and two-dimensional systems.  ***",
