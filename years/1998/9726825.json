 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schaeffer  9726825    The research goals of this project are to test hypotheses about the genetic   forces that modulate variation of chromosomal alterations that modify gene   order known as inversions.  The chromosomal inversions on the third   chromosome of Drosophila pseudoobscura have figured prominently in the   literature of evolutionary biology for more than fifty years.  They have   proven to be a very useful model system for studies of geographic   variation, natural selection, gene flow, and genetic drift.  The inversions   seem to represent a clear case of adaptive selection because they vary in   frequency with the environment, form classical clines, and in some   populations there are seasonal cycles of inversion frequency.  The   objective of this proposal is to determine how selection acts on the   genetic contents of inversions within and among D. pseudoobscura   populations.  This research will discriminate between various models of   selection by analyzing nucleotide diversity of nine PCR amplified markers   uniformly distributed on the third chromosome of D. pseudoobscura.  The   nine markers will be sequenced in D. pseudoobscura strains collected from   four populations that span an inversion frequency cline.    Studies of molecular evolution over the past two decades have focussed on   the genetic forces that shape diversity of single genes and have not   considered if selection maintains assemblages of linked genes on   chromosomes.  It is an open question whether the association of genes on   particular chromosomes within the genome happened due to selection or   accident.  Inversions provide an important mechanism to maintain the   association of genetic diversity distributed across long distances of   chromosomes.  This project will provide valuable data on the genetic forces   that modulate the evolution of large segments of the genome in natural   populations.",
