 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid urbanization in the Central Valley of California has led to a growing need for professionals with both the conceptual and technical expertise to make effective land use planning decisions. California State University, Stanislaus, in its Urban Visualization Initiative proposes to address this need through the implementation of pedagogical and curricular innovations that will better prepare students for urban-planning professions.     A concentration of urban-related courses will be developed that will give students a wide breadth of exposure to urban-related issues in seven social science disciplines. Analytical computer techniques such as GIS will be incorporated into a variety of curricular applications, so that students will have the opportunity to make the critical connections between curricular subject matter and workplace techniques.     Students will have access to fifteen computers installed running GIS software. A scanner, plotter, digital camera and two printers will allow students to engage in industry standard GIS applications.  Laptop computers, a projection unit and computer management tools will assist faculty and students in this project and campus-wide to more effectively access data and make presentations.     Faculty will receive training in GIS applications and will learn how to access GIS educational resources on-line to facilitate incorporation of workplace techniques and inquiry-based learning into their course curricula. Students will apply the knowledge gained in enhanced classroom and laboratory sessions through independent research and internships with local projects and agencies.   This initiative serves as a model for areas of the nation that struggle with urban planning strategies in the face of rising population growth, by addressing the need for urban planners with both conceptual and technological skills, and incorporating new curricular and pedagogical strategies to better prepare students to address this need.",
