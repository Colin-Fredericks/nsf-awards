 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prince George's Community College, Largo, MD, is creating an institution-wide reform of courses and curricula with the goal of increasing our students' technological literacy and skills and their understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of the natural sciences, mathematics, social sciences, and technologies.\r\n\r\nUnder the leadership of the college's Vice President for Instruction who is serving as the project director, six faculty members have been selected to serve as the Alpha Team to design the first set of modules for their respective disciplines. These modules utilize technology, have interdisciplinary character, and are capable of spawning other curriculum products across the college. In Year II, faculty members are competing to become members of the college's Beta Team which adapt, adopt, and refine the modules and the related technologies that have been developed by Alpha Team members. The college is providing release time for these Beta Team members. The college then continues to provide release time for additional faculty who are competing to develop technology-rich, interdisciplinary modules in Years III and IV.\r\n\r\nDuring Year I, over 3,000 students/semester are being impacted by these technology-rich modules. It is envisioned that, through the use of release time from the college, these curricular innovations are reaching over 7,000 students per semester by the end of Year IV.\r\n\r\nTo prepare for this curriculum reform, the college has strengthened its technology professional development program for faculty and enhanced its infrastructure through addition of more hardware, software, technical staff, and additional computer classrooms and laboratories.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
