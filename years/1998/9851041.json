 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this proposal we seek ILI funding to upgrade the astronomical observing facilities at Luther College. Our current observing facilities are inadequate to meet the needs of our large classes. Also, modern digital cameras make exciting, new projects accessible to undergraduates. Astronomy has a unique ability to capture student interest and this equipment - telescopes, CCD cameras, portable computers and associated accessories and software, would reach a large portion of the student body. We will use the telescopes in observing sessions for introductory classes consisting primarily of non-science majors and including a large fraction of elementary education majors. These classes are large and require a few observing stations to meet the needs of the students. Not only would these observing sessions allow the students to see objects discussed in lecture but we would present the observational evidence for ideas that have shaped science such as the Copernican model of the solar system and Newton's law of universal gravitation. In addition, the students would learn the power of instrumentation in making astronomical observations. We are in a position to take full advantage of this equipment with advanced students because we will be able to obtain two Sun workstations from the college for use with this project. Astrophysics students will then be capable of processing data from CCD observations to make precise measurements of objects like variable star periods and the orbital periods of Jupiter's moons. We will also utilize archived astronomical data to compare to their measurements and as input separate data analysis projects. As a final application of this equipment, we will develop an outreach program with local K-12 schools. This program will involve Luther faculty and students running observing sessions as part of a hands-on astronomy program offered to the schools and one telescope will be available on a loan basis.",
