 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806368  Dick    The Bryozoa (Ectoprocta) comprise a phylum of colonial animals broadly  distributed worldwide in marine and freshwater benthic habitats. Colonies,  which are readily visible, are composed of hundreds or thousands of tiny  zooids, each less than a millimeter long. There are an estimated 6,000  living species and over 15,000 described fossil species. The largest group  containing living bryozoan species is the class Gymnolaemata, currently  divided into two orders: Ctenostomata and Cheilostomata. Ctenostomes have  zooids with uncalcified walls, whereas cheilostomes have calcified walls.  The large majority of living bryozoan species are cheilostomes, which have  undergone a great radiation since their appearance approximately 145  million years ago. Because of their extensive fossil record, considerable  diversity, and broad distribution, cheilostomes have been very important  in evolutionary and ecological studies. However, correct interpretation of  these studies depends upon a reliable knowledge of evolutionary  relationships among cheilostomes. Reconstructing this phylogeny using  morphological characters has been exceedingly difficult, due to high  levels of convergence among characters. To begin to remedy this problem,  this study will gather DNA sequence data from bryozoans and perform  cladistic analyses to reconstruct phylogeny. Preliminary work utilizing a  partial sequence of the mitochondrial, large-subunit 16S rRNA gene has  suggested that cheilostome phylogeny is likely to be complex, and  inseparable from a broader consideration of gymnolaemate phylogeny. The  goals of this study are 1) to utilize sequences from the nuclear 18S rRNA  gene to determine whether the Gymnolaemata are a monophyletic group in the  context of a higher-level bryozoan phylogeny, and to reconstruct  higher-level relationships among ctenostome and cheilostome bryozoans, and  2) to utilize sequence data from both the 18S rRNA gene and the  mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene to reconstruct superfamily- level relationships  among cheilostomes.",
