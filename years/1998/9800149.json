The intent of the NRC is to examine the health and status of the field of astronomy and astrophysics, set forth priorities for scientific programs, and make recommendations for future progress in the field.  The report will be published by the National Academy Press.     About once a decade, over the past forty years, an assessment of the progress in the field of astronomy and astrophysics has been conducted under the auspices of the National Research Council (NRC).  The most recent such study resulted in the report,  \"The Decade of  Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics\" (National Academy Press, 1991), which is also known as the Bahcall report.  John Bahcall was the chair of the group that prepared the report.   This report will be prepared in the same tradition.  Extensive contact with the astronomy and astrophysics community plays an essential role in the preparation of the survey reports.   There will be contact with the scientific community and input from the scientific community.  This will be achieved through mailing out information,  public policy sessions held at professional society meetings, Internet e-mail and web site access, and open meetings of subdisciplinary panels.    ***",
