 "awd_abstract_narration": "Numerous applications in sciences, engineering and  mathematics give rise to problems involving structured  matrices such as Toeplitz, Hankel,  Vandermonde,  controllability, observability, Cauchy, Bezoutians, along  with  many other patterns of structure. In many of these  applications the use of standard  mathematical software  tools (such as MATLAB, Mathematica, Maple, LAPACK, etc.) is  not appropriate, because their ignoring of structure  requires unnecessary storage as well as an extremely large  amount of CPU time. Secondly, many structured matrices,  e.g., Hankel, Pick, Hilbert, Vandermonde, are extremely ill-  conditioned, so that all available standard methods often  fail to produce even one correct digit in the computed  solution.  The objective of this project is the study of theoretical  and computational problems related to structured matrices  which arise in several applied areas, including signal and  image processing, system theory, and control theory. New  accurate fast and superfast algorithms will be developed for  several new classes of structured matrices, arising in  rational matrix interpolation and approximation problems  with norm constraints, in Gaussian quadrature as well as in  signal and image processing. Along with these direct  methods, the approach will be used to design new classes of  preconditioners based on discrete real transforms to speed-  up the convergence of the conjugate gradient method for  block Toeplitz-plus-Hankel matrices.",
