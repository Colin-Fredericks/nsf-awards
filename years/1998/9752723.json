 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop is designed to introduce college mathematics teachers to the art and science of model-building, and to help them gain the skill and confidence needed to introduce modeling activities in their own undergraduate teaching.    The specific theme of the workshop is \"Mathematical Modeling of Environmental and Natural Resource Conflicts,\" a topic chosen for its intrinsic importance, rich mathematical content, and strong appeal to students.  Involvement in an applied mathematical modeling project can help students understand the central role that mathematics plays in modern science, and demonstrate to them the value of further mathematical study.    The formal workshop will occur over two summers.  During the intervening academic year each participant will teach an undergraduate modeling course or undertake a project at his or her home institution while keeping in contact with workshop colleagues via the Internet.    The first summer program will include two intensive weeks of formal study and field trips to learn about \"real-world\" environmental disputes in the Northern Rockies.  The second summer workshop will be devoted to discussions of completed project and seminars on modeling issues.",
