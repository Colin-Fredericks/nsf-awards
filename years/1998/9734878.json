 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is three fold.   First, azo and perester   containing bi- and tri-functional free-radical initiators will be   synthesized and examined as  precursors to star polymers, and block   copolymers containing functional groups at the block interfaces.  Second,   the radical chemistry of molecules containing an azoxy group will be   examined with a specific emphasis on determining, depending on the   position of azoxy group, the mechanisms of intramolecular cyclization and   ethylene evolution.   Lastly, the mechanism by which halogens form   complexes with azoalkanes and 1,2-dialkylhydrazines will be elucidated   and the radical chemistry of the resulting adduct examined.   Graduate   and postdoctoral students will be introduced to the free radical   chemistry of the aforementioned organic molecules, and free radical   polymerization.  With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports the research and educational activities of Dr. Paul Engel of the   Department of Chemistry at Rice University.   Dr. Engel will focus his   research on the synthesis and characterization of organic molecules   containing two or more azo or perester groups.   Activating these groups   with either heat or light leads to highly reactive sites referred to as   free radicals.   By positioning the azo or perester groups within the   molecule, and thereby defining the sites at which the free radicals are   generated, Dr. Engel will examine the mechanism by which two sites within   the same molecule couple to form a cyclic molecule, and the mechanisms by   which sites on one molecule react with another molecule to propagate the   formation of the radical, and the subsequent growth of polymers with new   molecular shapes and composition.   Dr. Engel's educational activities   involve training graduate and postdoctoral students in the synthesis of   molecules containing azo and perester groups, their activation to form   free radicals, and the characterization of the subsequent chemistry of   these reactive intermediates.",
