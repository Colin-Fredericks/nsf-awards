 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to advance our understanding of the causes of variations in the levels of contributions men make towards raising their own children as opposed to their contributions towards raising other related children.  The project involves the dissertation research of a cultural anthropologist from the University of New Mexico, studying the Garifuna ethnic group of Honduras, Central America. Among this society some men are fully involved in the upbringing of their children, while others are minimally involved and direct much of their income towards their maternal home to support their adult sisters as they raise children, nieces and nephews of the men.  Hypotheses about features of society which cause these patterns will be tested quantitatively using structured interview techniques.  Features of the kinship system, marriage system, local economic conditions, migratory labor patterns and  household types will all be examined as potential determinants of paternity support.  An understanding of what motivates and what discourages the parental involvement of men is of increasing interest as evidence accumulates world-wide on the negative impact of paternal absence on a wide range of childhood outcomes. The new knowledge from this project will be useful to evolutionary theorists as well as planners concerned about parental involvement in children's welfare.  In addition the project will advance ther training of a young social scientist and improve our knowledge about this important area of the world.",
