 "awd_abstract_narration": "9720652  Draayer  The objectives of Louisiana EPSCoR are to become:  (1) more  competitive in gaining national research and development (R&D)  support, (2) more actively engaged in science and technology (S&T)  transfer activities with business and industry, and (3) more effective  in educating larger numbers of S&E students, especially minorities, at  both the undergraduate and graduate levels.  The cornerstone of the  State's plan is the Louisiana Education Quality Support Fund.   Combining Support Fund money with EPSCoR support, the Louisiana Board  of Regents (BoR) co-sponsors statewide programs with federal agencies  that focus on stimulating systemic and sustainable S&T improvements,  facilitating collaboration and sharing of resources, and on improving  student teaching and opportunities. Targeted are R&D areas that help  develop and strengthen the economy of both the State and Nation.  A  major objective will be expansion and strengthening of an innovative  program that received a 10-year BoR commitment:  the Joint Faculty  Appointments Program (JFAP).  The JFAP establishments nationally  competitive S&E research teams between the state's Historically Black  (HB) and Majority White (MW) Colleges and Universities (CUs).  Six  additional JFAP/Research Excellence (RE) teams and two annual  JFAP/Science Education (SE) awards for educational enhancement  activities will be initiated.  In addition, to bring researchers from  different campuses together to focus on issues of common S&E interest,  a \"Planning Grants for Major Initiatives\" program will award annually  two $60K grants to build constituencies and prepare NSF major  initiative proposals.  Another form of collaboration - researchers and  industry - is scheduled for significant expansion, with plans to  assess and alleviate barriers to the state's commercialization  process, review university commercialization policies and develop a  statewide commercialization plan and higher education S&E  commercialization curriculum.  Collaborativ e efforts will be  strengthened by placing existing or planned statewide communication  avenues at the disposal of faculty and students.  These include:  (1)  an Audio/ Video Research Network, soon to be at 13 sites; (2) an ATM  Internet Backbone; (3) a Faculty Expertise Database, ultimately to  include a listing of Louisiana's major research facilities and  instruments; and (4) an Electronic Research Administration project to  automate grant and contract administration activities.",
