 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731374  Moore    This four year project is awarded $743,603  to provide enhancement activities for 160 chemistry teachers, 40 each year, in materials science.  The workshops will be three weeks long and will have additional follow-up. These workshops will begin in the summer of 1998, continuing through the summer of 2001.   The major content of the workshops will be the vast body of materials science and solid-state chemistry that can be used to illustrate typical high school chemistry topics.  The workshops will: 1) Introduce teachers to a large body of chemistry that was not included in their pare-service education;  2) Provide teachers with real world examples of state-of-the-art chemistry and hands-on materials that will stimulate students' interest in science and chemistry; 3)  Model up-to-date pedagogy and enable teachers to merge the new content and pedagogy into their chemistry curricula and classes;  4) Help teachers develop the leadership skills necessary to bring about positive changes; 5) Publish a materials science resource book that will be developed by the participant of the workshops and will be specifically geared to high school science teachers.  Participants will be selected on the basis of their potential for significant outreach, evidence of leadership qualities, connections to ICE Affiliates, district support, and potential for enhancing their current chemistry curriculum with new materials.  There will be continuous and on-going ICE  follow-up.     This project will provide matching funds from non-Federal sources totaling $178,652 which represents 24% of the award amount.",
