University of Colorado at Boulder    ESS: COIL: A Common Object Interconnection Language to Support Database  Integration and Evolution    Commercial information management technology is about to undergo a massive   developmental phase. The emerging global economy has created a dramatic   demand for distributed database technology, so that far-flung corporations   can manage information that is strewn across dozens or hundreds of   incompatible databases. The development of high-bandwidth networking   technology has provided the infrastructure for supporting such distributed   databases. What is missing is the software to make effective use of this   hardware. Currently available software allows data to be accessed   regardless of its physical location, but does not provide significant   support for interrelating databases that are incompatible in the way they   structure data and in the terminology used to describe data. Simply put,   current software allows databases to be located at multiple physical places   around the globe, but cannot effectively resolve semantic differences. The   COIL (Common Object Interconnection Language) project has as its goal the   development of a computer language for programming and rapidly evolving   interconnections between multiple, incompatible databases. The COIL   programming language will allow software applications using mainstream   relational database products (such as Oracle, Sybase, and Microsoft Access)   to be interconnected. COIL will also allow applications to share data   between relational systems and newer, more powerful object-oriented and   object/relational databases.",
