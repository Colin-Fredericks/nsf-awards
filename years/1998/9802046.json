 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802046  Goodkind    This  is  a  low temperature physics project which deals  with  a  recent discovery of some interesting anomalies in the propagation  of  sound in He-4 crystals containing small amounts of He-3.  The  anomalies involve the sound velocity and the acoustic attenuation  at  a temperature near 1 K and depend on the concentration of the  He-3  impurity.  A conjecture has been made that these  anomalies  can  be  explained on the basis of a Bose-Einstein  condensation.  The purpose of this project is to perform refined measurements to  determine whether the anomalies give evidence for a new family of  excitations which travel ballistically or in a second sound mode,  and  whether  the  observed phase transition  is  a  truly  Bose-  Einstein  condensation of these excitations. This project  offers  an  opportunity  for  the  training of  graduate  students  in  a  forefront area of contemporary physics.  %%%  Research in low temperature physics has resulted in the discovery  of   a  phenomenon  called  the  Bose-Einstein  condensation   of  elementary  particles and, more recently, ultra  cold  atoms,  an  effect which was predicted in the 1920's. Still more recently,  a  discovery  was  made  that  in solid helium-4  (the  most  common  variety  of  this element) a peculiar and as yet  not  understood  behavior  of  the propagation of sound and its attenuation  takes  place when the solid contains a small amount of the light isotope  helium-3  as  an  impurity.  There  is  no  accepted  explanation  available for this anomalous behavior and a suggestion  that  the  observed phenomenon is due to a Bose-Einstein condensation is met  with  skepticism.  The proposed research is designed  to  provide  more  accurate  and detailed data which will allow  a  definitive  interpretation of the anomaly.  The resolution of this problem is  of  fundamental  importance to the physics of  condensed  matter.  This  project offers an opportunity for the trainin g of  graduate  students in a forefront area of contemporary physics.  ***",
