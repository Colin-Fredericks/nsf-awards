Technical advances in oil recovery and increased environmental stewardship are providing substantial new opportunities for drilling fluid additives which are environmentally-benign and which offer enhanced performance characteristics.  We propose to examine derivatives of the natural polysaccharide chitosan as an alternative water-soluble viscosifying polymer in drilling fluids.  Specifically, we propose to: (1) produce chitosan from crabshell wastes; (2) derivatize chitosan to yield polymers which offer low-shear-rate viscosities (i.e. have yield stresses) but which are shear thinning; and (3) perform laboratory tests to study the performance of the chitosan derivatives in simulated oil drilling applications.  The project team for this study is a subset of a larger team which is examining how to commercially convert Maryland's crabshell wastes into chitosan in partnership with end-users who are developing large volume outlet markets for low-end chitosan.    If successful, this research would lead to two commercial opportunities.  First, large-volume markets would develop for high performance, environmentally-friendly chitosan derivatives as drilling fluid additives.  Second, supplying large-volume chitosan markets would provide commercial opportunities to convert seafood wastes into a value-added products.  ***",
