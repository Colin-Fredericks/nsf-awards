 "awd_abstract_narration": "This major research instrumentation (MRI) grant provides funding for setting up a state-of-the-art, integrated crystal growth and wafer manufacture research facility at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, which will comprise crystal growth, substrate manufacturing, material characterization, thermo-optical measurements and process modeling laboratories. The major instrumentation to be acquired through this grant includes: the next generation high pressure Czochralski crystal growth system with provisions for in-situ synthesis of compound materials as well as an applied magnetic field; a multizone modified Bridgman furnace with advanced instrumentation; an inner diameter wafering saw; a chemo-mechanical polishing apparatus; and a 2-axis/3-axis x-ray characterization instrument. They will add to the university's existing facilities for experiments, process modeling and virtual prototyping. These facilities will help to broaden the talent base available to address specific problems in the field of crystal growth and wafer manufacturing, and provide access to highly specialized and costly facilities that would be otherwise unavailable. The MRI grant will help in further expanding the university's research efforts in both basic and applied sciences, provide a focus to attract more industrial participation, and help in developing a better academic and research environment in this field.        With the support of MRI funds, Stony Brook will be able to establish an integrated experimental and theoretical, industry/university/federal laboratory research program for semiconductor processing at the pre-device level that is non-existent in the country. It will allow validation of numerical models that cannot be accomplished without conducting carefully-designed experiments for a wide range of parameters, feasibility study of new concepts, design verification, and test of model-based feed-forward control algorithms. It will also serve as a clinic to which industry can visit for intellectual support, theoretical modeling and experimental testing. Research on both elemental and compound materials will be pursued with results directly applicable to electronics, opto-electronics, laser-based devices, photovoltaics, sensors and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS).",
