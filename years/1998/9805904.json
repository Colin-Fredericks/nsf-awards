 "awd_abstract_narration": "9805904 Brion The objective of this research is to increase the understanding of the kinetics of iodine inactivation of viruses in drinking water supplies. In particular, this project will study the effect of initial virus concentration on the reaction kinetics.  Current disinfection theory is based on single-order reaction kinetics in which the disinfection rate is independent of the initial concentration of the microorganism. This research will test the hypothesis that iodine inactivation of virus is dependent upon the initial concentration of the virus. The MS-2 bacteriophage will be used as the viral agent. \r\n\r\nThe research addresses a major gap in our knowledge concerning viral contamination of drinking water and its treatment and should lead to improved and more effective methods of viral inactivation. The results of the research, and associated attendance and presentations at national research conferences and meetings, provides opportunity for the PI to enhance her career and support her university as it strives to become a nationally recognized research institution\r\n",
