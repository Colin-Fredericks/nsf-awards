The goal will  be to identify the best factor combinations while minimizing and  measuring the noise. The research effort is mainly concentrated in  the construction of designs capable of investigating location and  dispersion effects, compound orthogonal arrays with high strength,  g-designs as core sub-designs ,and orthogonal arrays of strength t  plus.    The success of any serious scientific study depends on the way it is  designed and the related data being collected and analyzed. Noise is  the biggest nuisance while the goal is to relate the outcomes to the  levels of the factors influencing the study. This is true in almost  all social, engineering, environmental, and medical studies. It is  costly and indeed unwise to eliminate noise entirely. Indeed in many  studies it will be enough if one knows the source and the intensity  of noise. Under the latter condition it is possible to explore how the  surrounding factors are impacting the outcomes. The investigator  explores all these interconnected topics and identifies new cost- and  time-effective and improved statistical designs capable of handling  these highly complicated scientific issues.",
