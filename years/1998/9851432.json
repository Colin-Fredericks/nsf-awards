 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Technology Department of Three Rivers Community-Technical College(TRCTC) is enhancing its curriculum in Photonics Engineering Technology through the development of a Lightwave Communications Laboratory. Thederegulation and globalization of the telecommunications industry has resulted in a rapid increase in the demand for technicians educated in lightwave communications. A recent federally funded study predicted that the demand for photonics technicians, including fiber optics technicians, would nearly double to 740,000 by the year 2000. A meeting of the Connecticut Photonics Industry Cluster inthe Spring of 1997 described a critical need for technicians in the state, and urged that fiber optics programs at the State's Community-Technical Colleges be strengthened. To address this need, the Lightwave Communications Laboratory is providing students with experience with a state-of-the-art fiber optic communication system.  Each station emulates a \"real world\" lightwave communication system, capable of transmitting multi-gigabit information through several kilometers of optical fiber.  The opportunity to gain hands-on experience better prepares students for careers in photonics or telecommunications or to pursue additional studies at the baccalaureate level.",
