 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interactive rendering is crucial to virtual design and  prototyping of large engineering models. This research will  produce techniques to significantly speed up the rendering of  surface models on current graphics systems. The emphasis will be  on novel algorithmic improvements in processing and rendering of  large models.   The effectiveness of using analytic surfaces and  other higher order representations of large models will also be  investigated. Such representations contain more information than  polygonal representations, but take less space to store. Recent  improvements in efficient tessellation and rendering of  parametric surfaces have opened up new possibilities for speeding  up the rendering of large surface models. This research will use  and improve these results. In particular, it will result in the  following:    -  Higher-order and hierarchical representations tessellated on-  line into a small number of triangles, based on the user's  position  -  Efficient visibility processing of surfaces    -  Interactive rendering of dynamically changing surfaces    -  Improved sampling of surfaces for the generation of textured  polygonal approximations    -  Configurable system that adjusts rendering speed and quality  without requiring user input    -  Algorithms that scale well with both available computing  resources and model size    -  A unified framework that allows various techniques to  inter-operate and results in combined improvement in the state of  the art    The project also includes design and installation of new computer  graphics courses and laboratories in the computer science  department at the Johns Hopkins University. Significant  interactions between the classrooms and laboratories are planned.  The usenet and the world wide web will be widely used to augment  the classroom teaching. In addition, seminars and informal  meetings will be organized to discuss research in computer  graphics.",
