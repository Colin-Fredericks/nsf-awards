 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nChernov\r\n     \r\nThe project is devoted to mathematical problems in equilibrium and \r\nnonequilibrium statistical mechanics, focusing on the ergodic and \r\nstatistical properties of deterministic chaotic dynamical systems. \r\nSpecific models include Lorentz gases in external fields, viscous \r\ngases of hard balls, open Hamiltonian systems with escape holes. We \r\nare going to study rigorously several laws of physics (including \r\nOhm's law, Green-Kubo formula and Einstein relation) for \r\nmultiparticle Lorentz gases in external fields with discrete and \r\ncontinuous times. We expect to prove exponential decay of \r\ncorrelations, Bernoulli property and various probabilistic limit \r\ntheorems. The ergodic properties and entropy of hard ball gases will \r\nalso be studied. Another direction of research is to investigate \r\nconditionally invariant measures, escape-rate formalism, and fractal \r\nstructure of chaotic repellers in open systems (with escape holes). \r\n     \r\nThe mathematical theory  of chaos and  dynamical systems has grown \r\ndramatically over the past 40 years. It started with foundations of \r\nstatistical physics created by Boltzmann and Maxwell. It has covered \r\nbasic biological models (dynamics of population), various problems \r\nin engineering, earthquake prediction, traffic control, neural \r\nnetworks for computer data processing, optimization of manufacturing \r\nand management tasks, and has countless other applications where \r\nlong-time behavior of complex systems is in question. Universal \r\nfeatures of chaos exhibited by various processes in nature and \r\nsociety make it possible to describe and predict such phenomena \r\nby the means of one theory. In particular, the concepts of \r\nattractors and repellers (as structures or patterns determining \r\nlong-time evolution of complex systems) are basic categories in \r\nthe theory of chaos. Mathematical theory of chaotic attractors \r\nand repellers is still relatively young and quite different from \r\nthe old, classical mathematics. \r\n",
