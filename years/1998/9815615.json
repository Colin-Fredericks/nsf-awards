The system will be designed using the recently developed dynamic and partially reconfigurable field programmable logic arrays (DPGA) and reconfigurable field programmable analog arrays (FPAA).  They not only allow time-multiplexing of different tasks that are mapped on the same silicon area, but also allow overlapping of active computation in one section with configuration of another section of the chip.  The granularity at which the reconfiguration can be applied can be a single programmable cell logic block.  A development board and associated CAD software tools will be build that will permit the design of mixed-signal systems.  A key feature of the system is that part of the computation can be performed in the analog domain and part of it can be performed in the digital domain.  The development board will include a microprocessor and associated hardware interfaces to control the two arrays.  The project is a collaborative effort of the Center for Low Power Electronics and Western Design Center (WDC), one of its small business partners.  The mixed-signal development system (board and software) will be manufactured and commercialized by WDC.  The system will also be distributed to university teaching and research laboratories to be used as a vehicle for the rapid prototying of analog, digital and mixed-signal circuits. \r\n",
