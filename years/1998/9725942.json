 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725942  Secor    This award supports a three year collaborative research  project between Professor David Secor of the University of  Maryland and Professor Masaru Tanaka of Kyoto University in  Japan.  The researchers will be exploring ecophysiology of  larval-stage dispersal in estuarine fishes.  A critical  phase in estuarine fishes is the transition between larval  and juvenile stages.  For Japanese sea bass, transition-  phase fish move from brackish to freshwater habitats.  The  researchers will examine the timing of this habitat shift in  relation to:  (l) the physiological ability of larvae to  adapt to changing salinity habitats; (2) the size and age of  larvae; and (3) environmental conditions.  The project will  couple methodologies in otolith microanalysis and  immunocytochemistry.  The otolith's chemical record will  serve as a chronometer on the timing of the habitat shift  relative to age and size.  Individual level analysis of  endocrine function will indicate whether a larva is  competent to change habitats.     This project brings together the efforts of two  laboratories that have complementary expertise, research  capabilities and equipment.  The collaboration will unite  the U.S. researcher's expertise in otolith microanalysis  with the Japanese expertise in immunocytochemistry.  Research results of otolith microanalysis will establish the  where's and when's of larval ingress or egress into juvenile  habitats.  Also the endocrine status and larval growth rate  will provide information on how the habitat shift is  successfully accomplished.  Through the exchange of ideas  and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic  knowledge and promote international understanding and  cooperation.  ***",
