 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800617  Yarmush  This SGER proposal deals with increasing the effectiveness  often transfer to mammalian cells using recombinant  retroviruses.  In previous efforts, the PIs have found that  glycoproteins produced by virus producer cells inhibit  retroviral-mediated gene transfer.  Enzymes that degrade  these proteoglycans enhance the productivity of the gene  transfer to mammalian cells.  Since the size of the  proteoglycans and the viral particles are similar, physicals  separations seem unlikely.    The overall goal of this proposal is to better understand  the role of the proteoglycans in the inhibition process.  This will be accomplished by:            Isolating and purifying the proteoglycans and studying         their impact, and the impact of their protein and glycan         fragments on the transfer process            Measuring the binding of these inhibitors to both the         target cells and the retrovirus.  Identify the inhibitor         fragment and the cell receptor responsible for the         inhibition.            Develop a model of the inhibition process    A better understanding of the inhibition mechanism and its  scope should facilitate discovery of routes to remedy the  problem.  One such route already considered involves  incorporation of genes for proteoglycan destruction.  ***",
