 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three academic departments (Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and The Institute of Optics) at the University of Rochester will jointly offer a new curriculum in Image Science and Electronic Imaging Systems.  The three departments have undertaken this ambitious project in recognition of the fundamental role that electronic imaging plays in the current and future economic growth of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Image Science and Electronic Imaging Systems curriculum will span all four undergraduate years and the first year of graduate school.  A student will be able to obtain a Bachelors of Science Degree from one of the three departments with a Concentration in Imaging.  Outstanding students will be able to take advantage of the University of Rochester's 3+2 Plan.  The 3+2 Plan enables one to earn a Masters of Science after five years by taking graduate courses during the student's senior year.  The Masters of Science program provides students the opportunity to concentrate on one of three Imaging Tracks.  The tracks are Medical Imaging, Image Science and Image & Video Computing.  A student finishing this program will earn a Masters of Science in one of the three disciplines with a specialization in one of the Imaging Tracks. \r\n\r\nThe proposed curriculum will include five new courses and nine enhanced courses, seminars or laboratories.  The five new courses form the core of the undergraduate education Image Science and Electronic Imaging.  A special freshman course, Quest Course in Electronic Imaging Systems, will provide students a comprehensive overview of electronic imaging. Four Foundations of Imaging courses round out the undergraduate education.  Two new seminar series will be initiated (for credit) that will keep students and faculty aware of leading edge technology and science.  Summer research opportunities for undergraduates will provide an early introduction to scientific method and \"real\" problems in electronic imaging.\r\n\r\nThis combination of lectures, laboratories, seminars and research experience will facilitate the introduction of leading edge, current research in electronic imaging into the undergraduate curriculum.  Using the industrial contacts developed through the Center for Electronic Imaging Systems, students will be exposed to industrial research and development programs, thus gaining true insight to job opportunities outside of academia.\r\n",
