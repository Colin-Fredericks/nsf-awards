 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-9800605  Abstract of research proposal \"Partial Differential Equations\"   by Richard Beals, Department of Mathematics, Yale University      The principal goal of this project is to find solution operators   in as explicit a form as possible for model second order linear   operators of various types: subelliptic operators, such as those  associated to boundary problems in complex domains; degenerate elliptic,   and associated degenerate parabolic and weakly hyperbolic operators;  and operators of mixed type, such as those that occur in statistical   physics.  This continues, and expands considerably on, earlier work   with B.Gaveau and P.C.Greiner which has produced explicit formulae   and optimal parametrices for a number of model subelliptic operators   associated to strongly and weakly pseudoconvex domains.  In another  direction, work is planned with D.H.Sattinger on completely integrable   equations, focussing on the spectral and inverse spectral transforms   for energy dependent potentials.      Most physical and geometric phenomena are described by partial   differential equations, typically by equations of second order.   Examples include the equations that describe the behavior of   sound, light, radiation, diffusion, nuclear processes, and so on.   Exact solutions for the model equations of classical physics have   played a central role in the development both of mathematical  physics and of the general theory of partial differential equations.   Much of the advance in the latter theory in this century has been due   to refinements in the technique for approximating the solutions of   more complex equations, both theoretically and numerically.    Nevertheless among these more complex equations are models for which   it is possible to find exact solutions, and it is hoped that the   exact solutions will again play a role in our understanding at a more   detailed level.  This proposal describes certain linear equations of   interest for which it may be possible, building on recent wor k, to   obtain fairly explicit exact solutions.  It also proposes further   work on a widely studied technique that provides explicit solutions   of certain types of nonlinear partial differential equations.  Among   these equations are those that describe water waves, in certain   circumstances, and the propagation of pulses in optical fibers.",
