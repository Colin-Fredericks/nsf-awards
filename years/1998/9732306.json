 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns the design and implementation of symbolic,  numeric and geometric algorithms for the creation, manipulation  and visualization of polynomial (algebraic) curves, surfaces and  splines. Such algorithms form the science base for diverse  applications ranging from computer graphics game environments to  computer aided geometric design for simulation based design  prototyping.  The project has an abstract data type orientation.  In this framework, the choice of which representation of the  polynomial curve or surface patch to use is determined by the  desired optimality of the algorithms for the operations. Research  will therefore be done on different representations of algebraic  curve and surface splines for specific operations of display,  finite element mesh generation and polynomial spline model  construction.    Piecewise polynomial or rational functions or surfaces of some  fixed degree d and continuously differentiable up to some order r  are known as algebraic splines or finite elements.  While it is  possible to model a general closed surface of arbitrary genus as  a single algebraic surface patch, the geometry of such a global  surface is difficult to specify, interactively control, and  display.  This research will covers both implicit and parametric  algebraic surface splines (algebraic patches and non-uniform  rational B-spline patches).",
