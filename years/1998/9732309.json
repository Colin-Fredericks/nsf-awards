 "awd_abstract_narration": "Monte Carlo Arithmetic (MCA) is an extension of standard floating-  point arithmetic that exploits randomness in basic floating-point  operations.  MCA uses randomization to implement random rounding  --- which forces roundoff errors to be randomly distributed ---  and random unrounding --- which randomly extends the inputs of  arithmetic operations to arbitrary precision.    MCA has potential theoretical and practical benefits.  Random  rounding can be used to produce roundoff errors that are truly  random and uncorrelated, and that have zero expected bias,  thereby avoiding some anomalies of floating-point arithmetic.  Random unrounding detects catastrophic cancellation, which is the  primary way that significant digits are lost in numerical  computation.    The primary practical benefit of MCA appears to be that it can  give ordinary mortals an intuitive, empirical sense of the  accuracy of their computed results.  MCA transforms a floating-  point computation into a Monte Carlo computation, and roundoff  analysis into statistical analysis.  By running a program  multiple times, one directly measures sensitivity of particular  outputs to random perturbations of particular inputs.  Generally, it gives a different perspective on the study of  error.    The project will encompass two tasks:  first, development of an  MCA environment, a set of tools permitting numerical analysts to  run existing programs with MCA instead of standard floating-  point, and to analyze the results; second, study of several large-  scale applications, numerically interesting models that try to  establish, one way or the other, the usefulness of MCA in  practice.",
