 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant supports research in the design and analysis of  algorithms and improving the education infrastructure at the  PI's department.  The research focuses primarily on the  following areas:  (i) fast approximation algorithms for  intractable (NP-hard) problems; (ii) fast approximation  algorithms for very large problems requiring nearly linear-  time solutions; (iii) competitive analysis of on-line  caching problems.  The style of research emphasizes the  following:  (i) general techniques for understanding,  unifying, and simplifying large classes of algorithms; (ii)  theoretical measures that are more realistic than either the  standard worst-case or average-case models; (iii) empirical  studies of new algorithms demonstrating their effectiveness.  The education plan consists of the following.  (i)  Developing a training course for a core group of advanced  undergraduates who will them lead small weekly discussion  sections in the introductory courses.  (This will  simultaneously improve the introductory courses and provide  a training ground for students to become educators.)   (ii)  Working with an outside evaluator to extensively evaluate  the experience of majors and prospective majors.  Two  primary goals are to determine the effects of the  aforementioned discussion sections (both on the students in  the sections and those leading them), and to identify  reasons for the low rate of retention of women  undergraduates by the department.",
