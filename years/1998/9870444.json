Seat  Institution: University of Tennessee Knoxville    This project is to support a visiting professor position from which the professor 1) continues the refinement and expansion of pilot engineering curriculum designed to enhance performance of technical students and 2) developments and implements an Engineer Minor in Human Performance that adds complementary individual performance skills to the \"hard\" science skills typically learned in the mathematics, engineering, and science curriculum.  The minor requires four additional specialized courses in Applied Performance, Politics of Technology, Critical Analysis, and a concluding supervised Practicum in a soft skill role.     Assessment techniques are developed that allow measurement of performance instead of outcomes to judge the value added of the interventions.  These activities are designed to work at other institutions, and the interventions are transferable to industry.  Assessment is used to determine appropriate interventions and to measure change as a result of interventions.     The PI's career objectives are to take her industry experience and research background to develop a unique program that directly attacks the issues of how technical problem solvers use their abilities to contribute to a better world. The problem is usually not in deficient technical skills, but in how information is gathered and solutions are expressed.  The PI's intention is to use the opportunity of Visiting Professor to gain the necessary teaching experience and research credentials to begin a career in academe.    The College of Engineering at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville has piloted courses for the past two years with the Counselor Education/Counselor Psychology Department aimed at improving the team experience of senior engineering students in a capstone project.  This pilot has lead to the offering of two formal classes this academic year.  A new freshman curric ulum is being piloted this fall, and includes activities that are based on the previous work in the pilot programs.",
