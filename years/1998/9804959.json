 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most current digital video systems merely replace existing  modes of analog video delivery with their more efficient  digital counterparts. However, as packet-based networks,  such as the Internet, start to be an essential component of  the communications infrastructure and general purpose  computers become the predominant communication terminal,  there is a need to provide a new set of algorithms for video  compression and processing, which are optimized for an endto-  end software processing environment. The challenge is then  to find efficient ways of embedding video data on a  fundamentally asynchronous transmission/processing  infrastructure. To address this challenge this project  concentrates on two main areas: (i) computation/bandwidth  scalable coding and (ii) robust asynchronous video  transmission algorithms. The Internet is a heterogeneous  network, both in terms of its components (hosts, routers)  and in terms of available bandwidth and processing speed.  Thus bandwidth/computation scalable algorithms are desirable  to enable less complex encoding/decoding at the expense of a  reduction in video quality. This project is developing a  design methodology for variable complexity, input dependent  coding/decoding algorithms where the goal is optimizing  average (instead of \"worst-case\") complexity performance,  robust asynchronous video transmission algorithms are also  being developed, as motivated by the limited transmission  reliability offered by the Internet. Video is sensitive not  only to losses of information (e.g. packets being dropped  due to congestion) but also to excessive delay. This work  concentrates on new compression techniques for asynchronous  video transmission where each video unit (a part of a frame)  has a ``lifetime'' during which it is useful, and which can  span more than a single frame time interval. This area  includes novel work in both rate control and image domain  error correction/detection techniques.",
