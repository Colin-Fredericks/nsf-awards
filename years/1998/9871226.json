 "awd_abstract_narration": "*** 9871226  There is growing recognition of the special \"window on the past\"  afforded by paleo-climatological studies, notably those developed from  high resolution, continuous, well-dated, multivariate ice core  records.  The Climate Change Research Center (CCRC), Institute for the  Study of Earth, Oceans and Space at the University of New Hampshire,  has been a leader in the siting, recovery and chemical analysis and  interpretation of aerosol, snow and ice core samples from the Arctic,  Antarctic and Asia.  As a con- sequence of such research, investigation into  changes in climate and in the chemistry of the atmosphere is expanding both  nationally and internationally.  The scientific issues  posed require continued creativity, research on local to global scales and the  translation of resultant scientific concepts through academic curriculum and  public outreach.  This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project will allow  CCRC to address the foregoing by:  (1) broadening CCRC's global research  capability through upgrades to its mainst  ay research tool, ion chromatography, leading to improved laboratory efficiency,  replace-ment of current outdated instruments and new educational opportunities;  (2) broadening CCRC's research and educational activities through acquisition of  aerosol and precipita- tion sampling equipment in support of its local to  regional scale, New England based  , monitoring program; and (3) complementing CCRC's existing global glaciochemical  sampling capability by improving its existing continuous sampling equipment.  ***",
