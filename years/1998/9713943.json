 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713943  Riffle  This project is an interdisciplinary plan for engineering  carbon fiber reinforced vinyl ester composites to meet the  rigorous environmental durability needs for infrastructure.  Composite materials will be designed specifically to  withstand long-term moisture and UV exposure based on both  chemical constituents and composite construction,  particularly fiber-matrix interface design.  The project  encompasses modified resin and composite development,  hygrothermal and ultraviolet laboratory exposure,  environmental field testing, and residual mechanical  property analyses as a function of exposure.  This is the  first comprehensive study of an important class of candidate  materials for infrastructural uses where the constituent  chemistry, the environmental exposure, and the mechanics of  degradation are linked.  NIST will provide state-of-the-art  ultraviolet testing facilities and expertise for both the  laboratory and field experiments in collaboration with the  project.  The Tom's Creek Bridge project, a vinyl  ester/carbon/glass vehicular bridge constructed in  Blacksburg, VA  during the summer of 1997, will be leveraged  as a field-testing site.  The work will also be done in  close collaboration with major resin suppliers to insure  that modifications under consideration have potential for  large volume production, and to insure that technology is  transferred to appropriate producers efficiently.    The experimental plan is to design and fabricate composites,  age materials, and characterize damage.  ***",
