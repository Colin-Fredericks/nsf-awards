Under an earlier NASA SBIR award, fabrication procedures were developed which were successfully used to produce the high-quality, 50-mm-format SMCPs for the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), and for the Hubble Advanced Camera.  A significant number of 25-mm-format MCP wafers are available from the NASA SBIR award.  The objective is to use these wafers to optimize the procedures for fabricating high-quality SMCPs at a commercially-acceptable cost.  The optimum shear process will be established, etch and reduction procedures will be validated, and the performance characteristics of a number of finished SMCPs will be quantified.  At the end of Phase I, the goal is to have developed all of the data required to set up a dedicated SMCP fabrication and test facility, including a second-generation shear engine.      The SMCPs produced in this facility will have a very wide range of scientific and commercial applications in fast-timing and position sensitive detector systems.  These include time-of-flight mass spectrometry, ELTV and soft x-ray imaging and spectroscopy, military and civilian night-vision, low-light-level spectroscopy, and' speckle image reconstruction and wavefront sensing.  ***",
