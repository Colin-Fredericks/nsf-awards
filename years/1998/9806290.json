 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rieseberg   9806290         One of the most exciting recent advances in biology has been the ability to   generate detailed genetic maps for almost any plant or animal species. These   maps not only are essential for isolating genes of interest, but they also   can be used to study important questions in population biology such as how   new species are formed.  The purpose of this grant is to develop genetic   linkage maps for three wild sunflower species that are products of   hybridization between two other sunflower species. By comparing the genetic   maps of the hybrid species and their parents, it will be possible to   determine exactly what genetic changes are necessary for hybrid speciation   to occur and to estimate how rapidly this process might take place.         The primary outcome of this work will be a more predictive theory of hybrid   speciation.  However, the genetic maps generated by this research are likely   to be useful to researchers in a variety of fields ranging from ecology to   agriculture.  This is because the wild sunflowers to be investigated are   characterized by adaptations such as drought and saline tolerance that are   of interest to both ecologists and plant breeders.  The maps generated by   this proposal can be used to elucidate the genomic location and genetic   basis of these adaptations and to facilitate their transfer to the   cultivated sunflower.  In addition, novel analytical methods developed to   analyze the sunflower mapping data should be broadly applicable to any data   set that involves genetic linkage analyses.",
