 "awd_abstract_narration": "98-72433  Shetty    University of Hartford - Integrating Engineering Design with the Humanities, Social Sciences, Sciences & Mathematics    The proposed project will develop, apply, and test a model for an innovative undergraduate engineering curriculum through:  (1) the integration of contexualized, interdisciplinary research and design projects throughout four years of the program; (2) experiential and collaborative learning by both faculty and students; (3) partnerships with industry in the creation of \"real-life\" engineering projects for students at all levels; (4) cross-collegiate and cross-disciplinary teams of faculty working together and along side colleagues from the private sector to develop integration of curricular materials and coordination of assignments.  In undertaking this project, the University will build upon and extend current industrial/corporate partnerships established through the successful Engineering Applications Center and existing curricular reform efforts (supported by NSF and FIPSE).    This project will transform the College of Engineering by helping its faculty transition to new models of teaching and learning - especially those that help to insure the success of women and minorities - and by redefining the relationship between engineering faculty and students and those in the rest of the University.  A core group of innovative faculty will become team leaders for curricular reform at both the academic year level (Freshman, Sophomore, etc.) and at the Engineering program level (Civil, Electrical, & Mechanical Engineering).  These team leaders will work with the De3ans of other colleges in the University to identify appropriate faculty in the humanities, social and basic sciences, and mathematics to create interdisciplinary curricula.  Faculty will be trained in team-building, collaborative learning, new pedagogical approaches, especially those which enhance learning by women/minorities, and the creation of educational and student assessment technologies.  Through  participation in multi-disciplinary collaboration and the integration of engineering and non-engineering perspectives that we are trying to each students.  Thus, this project will provide a paradigm for other schools of engineering of how to transform faculty culture while also restructuring curricula in order to motivate, excite, and retain engineering students.  In addition, it will provide a model of how non-engineering faculty and students can be brought to understand the nature of engineering work in its broad social context.      Curricular innovations will result in several new course configurations:  the clustering of engineering and non-engineering courses into an integrated First-year Interest Group (FIG); the pairing of engineering and interdisciplinary courses in the sophomore and junior years with collaborative projects involving engineering and non-engineering students; and an interdisciplinary Senior Capstone Project.  An innovative curricular structure, the Integrative Learning Block, will be developed and will serve as the mechanism for fostering interdisciplinary, integrative, student-centered, project-based learning.",
