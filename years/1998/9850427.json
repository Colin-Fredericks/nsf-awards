 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major focus of this project is an upgrade of existing laboratories for cell biology, virology and recombinant gene technology.  Other courses such as animal physiology, immunology, plant physiology, and independent undergraduate research projects also benefit from this facility.  With the new cell culture facility, students are able to use animal and plant cells to study cellular events and gene expression. Virology has added a laboratory component to its syllabus. Recombinant gene technology (RGT) is a specialized program; the only one of its kind in the state and one of a handful in the nation.  A cell culture facility supports laboratory study of  eukaryotic gene expression in the RGT course. Results are being disseminated through state and national meetings. Laboratory manuals, web-site and publications are being distributed. Current assessment tests for undergraduate biology majors and student evaluation/feedback surveys are being modified to analyze success of this project. The addition of this facility provides a greater breadth of experience for students, and especially prepares Kentucky students, who are often first generation college graduates, with the laboratory skills needed to compete for positions both within the state and across the nation.",
