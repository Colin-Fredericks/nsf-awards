 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three classes of new mathematical problems related to\r\nmicromechanics will be studied analytically and numerically. \r\nThe first problem is the investigation of nonlinear fourth \r\norder partial differential equations describing the spreading \r\nof liquid film along a solid surface under recently proposed\r\nboundary conditions that represent the phenomenon more adequately \r\nthan previously used ones.  The second class of problems is \r\nconcerned with nonlinear parabolic equations describing flows \r\nof chemically active fluids where a new mathematical \r\nformulation was recently proposed.  The third class of problems \r\nis related to the numerical investigation of new free boundary\r\nproblems for the equation of elasticity related to fatigue crack \r\npropagation.\r\n     \r\nMicromechanics takes into account the transformation of\r\nmaterial microscopic structure in the process of flow or \r\ndeformation of real fluids and deformable solids.\r\nIt leads to new mathematical models and problems.\r\nThe mathematical models of three classes of practically \r\nimportant problems will be constructed and investigated. \r\nThey are: flows of thin films along solid surfaces, \r\nimportant for chemical and petroleum engineering;\r\nflows of reacting fluids near critical (pre-explosion) \r\nconditions, important for chemical engineering and internal \r\ncombustion engines; fatigue crack propagation and damage \r\nextension, important for a wide class of mechanical engineering \r\nproblems.  New mathematical models will be obtained and \r\ninvestigated.  Computational approaches will be combined with \r\nadvanced analytic studies.\r\n \r\n",
