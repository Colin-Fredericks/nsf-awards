This conjecture\r\nconcerns the intersection multiplicity of two finitely \r\ngenerated modules over a regular local ring which have the \r\nproperty  that their supports  intersect only at  the maximal \r\nideal of the ring. It states that the multiplicity is positive \r\nif and only if the sum of the dimensions of the supports is equal \r\nto the dimension of the ring.   Recently new developments in\r\nthe theory of resolution of singularities in mixed characteristic \r\nhave led  to a new approach to this problem, and these ideas have been \r\nused to show that intersection multiplicities are always \r\nnonnegative.  This proposal outlines an approach to \r\nthe positivity conjecture using these methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of how to define intersection multiplicities in \r\na satisfactory way has been an important topic in Commutative \r\nAlgebra for many years. The basic idea is to  measure of the extent\r\ntwo which two subspaces of a space  are tangent to each other, and the\r\ndefinition should satisfy various conditions to ensure that it\r\nagrees with usual definitions in simple cases and that it can\r\nbe used in computations.  A little over thirty years ago Serre \r\nproposed an algebraic definition  which satisfied many of the \r\nrequired properties but which involved negative terms.  There\r\nwere several questions left open concerning  when the intersection\r\nmultiplicities are zero (vanishing), whether they are always \r\ngreater than or equal to zero (nonnegativity), and the \r\nprecise conditions for them to be strictly greater than zero \r\n(positivity).  Since then the vanishing and, more recently, the \r\nnonnegativity conjectures have been proven. This proposal\r\nconcerns a study of  the positivity conjecture using new methods\r\nfrom Algebraic Geometry.\r\n \r\n",
