 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the research is to understand the steps that lead from the selection of a cell's developmental fate to the elaboration of its ultimate differentiated phenotype.  This problem is being studied using hairs (trichomes) on the leaves of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana as a model for understanding the control of cell differentiation.  These trichomes are highly specialized single cells that extend out from the epidermis.  Although in the field, Arabidopsis trichomes have been shown to provide significant protection from insect herbivores, trichomes are non-essential under laboratory conditions.  In addition, trichomes are located on the surface of the plant, and mutant phenotypes are readily observed.  These two features of trichomes have facilitated the isolation of mutants and genetic analysis.  Mutations in more than twenty different genes have been identified that affect trichome development and/or morphology, and three genes affecting trichome development have been cloned.  Two of the earliest-acting genes in the trichome development pathway have turned out to be transcription factors.  These genes commit an epidermal cell to a highly specialized differentiation process involving dramatic changes in cell shape.  At present, there is little understanding of how transcription factors can control processes such as polarized growth of a cell in any organism.  The ultimate goal of this project is to connect events occuring during the cell fate decision and the cellular mechanisms responsible for the mature trichome cell phenotype.  This connection is poorly understood in all organisms, and the study of trichome development is likely to produce results with broad implications for understanding development in plants and animals.",
