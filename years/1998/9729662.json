 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729662  Peralta    This award provides funds to support two three-month research  visits by Dr. Rene C. Peralta, Center for Cryptography, Computer  and Network Security (CCCNS), University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee,  for  collaboration with Dr. Eiji Okamoto, School of Information  Science, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology  (JAIST), Ishikawa, Japan.  Their research is concerned with the  design and implementation of algorithms which solve, for as large  a size as possible, those number-theoretic problems which are the  pillars of modern cryptography.  Determining what \"small-size\" is  too small to be secure is the main focus of this research  project.    The project will consider a host of problems such as primality  testing, fast arithmetic with large numbers, diophantine  approximation, rapid factorization of small numbers,  factorization of random numbers, and other problems that may  arise as the research progresses. The project will benefit from  access to the massive computational resources, five  supercomputers,  available at the host institution.  Collaboration with JAIST also will provide access to untranslated  Japanese literature and access to symposia where Japanese  research results can be received without the usual delay in  availability to the West.  The project is mutually beneficial as  it will provide ready access by the Japanese collaborators to  research results at CCCNS.  This project is supported under the  Science Fellowship Program between the National Science  Foundation and the Japan Foundation Center for Global  Partnership.  ***",
