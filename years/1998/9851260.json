 "awd_abstract_narration": "In keeping with the overall direction of research in the life sciences, molecular approaches have been widely implemented in the biology curriculum at Roger Williams University. For example, students currently maintain mammalian cells, mollusc embryos and plant calli in culture. They generate and label antibody and nucleic acid probes in order to detect specific polypeptides, genes, and mRNAs in extracts from these cultures. At present, we lack the ability to undertake detailed examination of these cells by phase contrast microscopy or to localize specific polypeptides and nucleic acid sequences by epifluorescence. In order to address these needs, we propose to acquire a high-resolution inverted phase contrast/fluorescence microscope. Acquisition of this instrument will help our students to gain a better understanding of important concepts in biology including: (i) the relationship between the structure and function of cells and tissues, (ii) the generation of patterns in development. and (iii) evolutionary changes in populations. To enhance the teaching of these concepts, new experiments based on phase contrast/ fluorescence microscopy will be incorporated into seven existing biology laboratory courses. The addition of phase contrast / fluorescence microscopy to the experimental strategies available to our students will increase the scope and depth of ongoing undergraduate research, and give students hands-on experience with techniques that have become indispensable in many areas of cell and molecular biology.",
