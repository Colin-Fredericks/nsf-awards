 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Environmental Geochemistry and Biogeochemistry Program   is jointly supported by the Divisions of Atmospheric Science and   Chemistry and by the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  Dr.   Scott T. Sandholm of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences,   Georgia Institute of Technology, will develop a photofragmentation laser   induced fluorescence sensor (PF-LIF) to measure volatile methyl iodide in   situ in the marine boundary layer.  Current detection methods for organic   iodides rely heavily on analysis of stored `grab` samples and can be   quite sensitive to preparation and handling of samples and to thermal   degradation.  The LIF sensor will permit in situ measurements as well as   temporal emission profiles of methyl iodide and other simple organic   iodides to the atmosphere from oceanic and coastal regions.  The method   is expected to have the sensitivity and selectivity needed to be   effective.  The similarities in photofragmentation dynamics of organic   iodides enables total iodine emission to be measured by following the   cumulative photofragmented production of atomic iodine as I* for all   organic iodides known to be emitted from oceanic sources.      The role of iodine in tropospheric and stratospheric ozone cycles is not   well understood due to lack of quantitative measurements of the source   compounds. Organic iodide compounds are thought to evaporate from the   ocean and serve as a source.  In this research, a new method for direct   measurement of iodine will be developed and tested in field deployment   off the coast of Georgia.",
