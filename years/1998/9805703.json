 "awd_abstract_narration": "9805703  Wood, David H.  University of Delaware    CISE PostDoc: Broadening DNA Computing Research    DNA as a computing medium gives unprecedented massive parallelism and storage.  These capabilities are to be exploited in three research goals. (1) Develop new algorithms using moderate amounts of DNA, in contrast to current algorithms which require excessive quantities of DNA.  (2) Design algorithms to use practical, realistic laboratory methods that will allow scaling up to the large problems of interest in computer science.  (3) Apply DNA Computing to NP-hard problems.    This Postdoctoral Research Associateship will advance the above goals by providing a broadening interdisciplinary experiences in (1) Seeking new algorithms for DNA Computing that can ultimately solve problems too difficult for conventional computers.  (2) Interacting with molecular biochemists on the feasibility and demonstrating these algorithms. In the context of this DNA computing research, the Research Associate will help to advance the current state of DNA Computation.  A new algorithm for the Directed Hamiltonian Path problem is to be implemented.  The Research Associate will refine the algorithmic techniques to be used, specifically revising them to be feasible in laboratory demonstrations.  The anticipated overall result of the research will demonstrate the feasibility of scaling up DNA computation to problems larger than those previously addressed.",
