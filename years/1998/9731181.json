In some instances where females outnumber males, reduced sexual   reproduction has been observed and attributed to this low male frequency.   This planning grant is designed to obtain baseline ecological information   that will support a full proposal to study 1) the causes of sex-specific   clonal (asexual) reproduction and 2) the effects of this reproduction on   the number of males and females in populations.  Diplasiolejeunea   pellucida, a small tropical plant that grows on living leaves of other   plant species will be the focal test species. This species grows on a   transient substrate; thus individuals must colonize, grow and sexually or   asexually reproduce quickly to colonize new substrate.  The activities   planned in this study includes: a) collecting demographic data on male and   female plants (by monitoring individual plants), b) determining the cause   of reduced sexual reproduction (by manipulating male frequency), c)   establishing protocols for culturing plants in natural and laboratory   conditions, and d) detecting sex-specific DNA markers and clonal structure   among plants in the population.         This project has broad scientific importance in three main areas of study   1) the contribution of asexual reproduction in reducing population   extinction, 2)  the causes and consequences of the differences between male   and female plants and 3) the relationships of asexual reproduction to other   characteristics of the organism (sexual reproduction, growth and survival).   Asexual reproduction has been largely ignored in evolutionary studies of   plants despite the fact that clonal growth greatly influences survival.   Some clonal plants show no sign of aging, making asexual reproduction a   distinctive and important ecological and evolutionary trait.  Information   obtained on Diplasiolejeunea pellucida can be invaluable in modeling sex   ratio patterns and consequence s in other plant species that are more   difficult to study.  Finally, many studies focus on allocation of resources   (energy and nutrients) for sexual reproduction, growth and survival.   Asexual reproduction is rarely incorporated into these studies yet most   organisms (animals, plants, fungi and others) are able to reproduce   asexually.  This study will contribute to our knowledge of how resource   allocation to asexual reproduction affects and is affected by sexual   reproduction, growth and survival .",
