The National Research Council selects members of the board based on their expertise in comparative education, teacher education, psychometrics, assessment, and education policy.  During its first decade, BICSE focused on improving the quality of large-scale cross-national education studies and indicators.  In addition, the board provided technical guidance to sponsors about the conduct and use of large-scale education studies, such as the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and the Computers in Education Study.  \r\n\r\nThe current grant (1998-2002) from NSF and NCES expands BICSE's scope of work to include examination of smaller scale international comparative education research and synthesis of lessons learned from past and current large-scale studies.  Building on BICSE's leadership as a national forum for synthesis, analysis, and strategic planning for international comparative research in education, the National Research Council has reconfigured the board to accomplish the goals set forth in the new scope of work.  The goals include: using the findings of international studies to improve U.S. education policy and education reform efforts; increasing the rigor and sophistication of these studies by encouraging synergies between large and smaller scale international comparative education research; identifying gaps in the existing research base; and assisting in the communication of results to policy makers and the public.  The ultimate goal of BICSE's activities in this grant cycle is to recommend a conceptual framework and agenda for future international education studies, as well as offer guidance for a supporting research agenda.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
