Proteins which have the unusual property of containing an attached lipid are important in an exceptionally broad group of disciplines.  For example, GPI-anchored proteins are found in the coat proteins of trypanosomes; acyl proteins form parts of the virion or perform essential roles in infectivity and replication of certain viruses; and isoprenoid addition is an essential modification for signaling proteins which regulate hormonal responses, vision, and calcium signaling.  The enzymes which attach or remove these lipids are being studied with increasing scrutiny because they present novel biophysical challenges for understanding the interface of membranes, lipids, and proteins.  Because lipid-modified proteins participate in a variety of cellular processes, scientists from  diverse disciplines have found in them, sometimes unexpectedly, a common interest. Two examples that have generated considerable attention are the involvement of myristoylated ARF proteins and prenylated Rab proteins in vesicular trafficking and the attachment of lipids to Ras proteins.  A pivotal question is the importance of interactions of lipid-modified proteins of all these varieties within specific subregions of membranes that are enriched in glycolipids or associated with physical structures known as caveolae.\r\n\r\nBecause scientists interested in lipid modification of proteins often attend only meetings in their own specialties,  they frequently do not learn of advances by others who work on these interesting proteins in different fields.  The key objective of this conference is to provide a venue for communication among  these investigators and to highlight the emerging possibilities for cross-disciplinary synergy.  This FASEB conference is particularly important since no other conference on the subject is being held in 1998.\r\n",
