 "awd_abstract_narration": "From its inception, an initiative to improve education and inclusion in science, mathematics, engineering, and  technology (SMET) of students with disabilities, must develop an active partnership between the scientific,  educational, non-profit and administrative communities.  Until the primary and secondary educational system  (educators, parents, students) perceives broader range of educational options for students with disabilities, Alaska,  and other rural and remote regions, will not see students and their families formulating individualized education  plans that draw upon the full wealth of students  talents.  Careers in the sciences and technology, especially those  including field work, will not be viewed as viable options.  This project will bring together numerous scientific  organizations, state education and nonprofit agencies to construct a proposal to benefit rural areas.  The second  proposal and network will seek funds to develop pedagogical, guidance and system practices to support and  encourage the participation in SMET by students with disabilities.  This project is conducting a series of face to face  meetings along with e-mail, US mail and telephone conferences to examine how best to address the needs of students  in rural and remote regions such as Alaska.  Such interaction will produce plans to construct the infrastructure and  programs to encourage full participation in science and mathematics education leading to careers in SMET.",
