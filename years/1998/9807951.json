 "awd_abstract_narration": "9807951  Kurz    This grant provides three years of partial salary support for the  Isotope Geochemistry Facility technician at Woods Hole  Oceanographic Institution (Mr. D. Lott).  This is a phase I  technician support grant under the Instrumentation and Facilities  Program (Earth Sciences).  Lott will have responsibility for  maintenance, training, and technical support associated with the  thermal ionization and noble gas mass spectrometers, under the  supervision of Dr. M. Kurz.  Lott has considerable experience in  developing cryogenic systems that are necessary for separating  the noble gases from one another prior to mass spectrometry.  This laboratory has excellent capabilities for helium, but is  increasingly focused on measurement of the heavier noble gases  (Ar and Xe). Lott will therefore devote some of his effort to  developing new methodologies for cryogenically separating the  heavy noble gases, in addition to training of graduate students  and supervision of day to day laboratory operations.  His  presence in the laboratory will insure that the instrumentation  remains state-of-the-art, and that the technical capabilities are  widely used.  The areas of research, that will benefit, cross  many disciplinary boundaries, ranging from surface exposure  dating of glacial deposits to mantle geochemistry.  There is a  large community of geochemists at Woods Hole who will also  directly benefit from the technical support.  ***",
