 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732519    This REU Site will provide an exciting and engaging  introduction to research for 10 undergraduates each summer.  These experiences will take place at the University of  Colorado's Mountain Research Station and will focus on the  behavior, ecology, and evolution of subalpine and alpine  organisms.  The program, which has been shaped through  experiences gained in previous REU Site grants, has three  components.  The first is a week-long intensive introduction  to research, built around a series of field problems that  are conducted with increasing levels of independence.  The  second is a summer-long course that deals with the  practicalities of research and of going to graduate school.  This course operates in parallel with 9-week student  projects done in association with faculty mentors.  The  summer culminates in project presentations that are given in  a scientific-meeting format.  Evaluations of prior REU  grants show that this program has been successful in  encouraging students to go to graduate school and in  generating a summer experience that has a profound effect on  the development of the participants' scientific careers.",
