 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9801672  Eberhart    Teaching Easy Access to Math and Science (TEAMS) links a largely urban unitary school to broad-based  partnership of higher education, business and industry, and community organizations to boost achievement in college  preparatory science and mathematics.  TEAMS is a collaborative venture of the Montgomery Public Schools with  Alabama State University, the University of Alabama in Birmingham, Auburn University, BellSouth, TCI  Cable Television, and the Montgomery YMCA.    Project TEAMS directly addresses the system-wide commitment to raising student expectations, improving teacher  performance, and providing support for all students to succeed.  The project, a system-wide initiative, will involve  30,651 students in 31 elementary schools and 14 secondary schools, with the exception of magnet and alternative  schools and special education centers.  MPS will implement Project TEAMS in order to reverse the current trend  of low enrollment in and successful completion of upper-level mathematics and science courses.  To accomplish this  goal, the following objectives will be met:    o        To double the number of students enrolling in and successfully completing, pre-college courses           which will prepare them to pursue undergraduate SMET programs  o        To double the enrollment of underrepresented minorities in advanced science and math courses  o        To double the number of graduates who successfully complete Algebra I by the end of the ninth           grade  o        To double the number of MPS graduates who successfully complete Physical Science by the end of the           ninth grade        o        To improve teacher performance through enhanced professional development programs  o        To increase parental involvement by 25% through improved access to schools and faculty  o        To increase community involvement by 25% through linkages between schools and businesses and other           community organizations  o        To raise student performance in  math and science achievement to national and state levels as measured by           the Standard Achievement Test Series  o        To revise the math curriculum to meet local, state, and National Council of Teachers of Mathematics           Standards  o        To revise the science curriculum to meet local, state, and National Science Education Standards           (Benchmarks).    To accomplish these objectives, Project TEAMS will address achievement with a comprehensive systemic approach  which will:    o        Increase student interest in science and math through demonstrating real-world relevance  o        Enhance learning through partnerships, collaboration, and cooperation  o        Stimulate scholarship based on the acquisition of critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities of           all students  o        Offer assistance to students experiencing difficulty, especially in gatekeeping courses, by                        incorporating curriculum enhancement and support skills  o        Energize teachers through intensive staff development programs focusing on hands-on learning,           inquiry learning, interdisciplinary interaction, learning styles, and raising expectations of all           students  o        Enrich student learning through extended-day, Saturday, and summer enrichment activities  o        Offer parents assistance that will enable them to become more involved in their children's education  o        Link schools to community, business, and higher education through special enrichment programs and           opportunities.",
