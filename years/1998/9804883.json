Tracy Rushmer (University of Vermont), George Bergantz (University of Washington) and Michael Brown (University of Maryland) are convening the meeting.   They are organizing the conference with the underlying premise that large-scale lithospheric processes trigger major growth episodes of continental crustal growth.  By utilizing recent work from across a range of disciplines they hope to ultimately provide an up-to-date assessment of their understanding of these processes.  The Ivrea Zone, which is a very well exposed, well-studied section of mid to lowermost continental crust and upper mantle, is located near Verbania and will be used as a template in which to focus on important aspects of continental growth and evolution.  These include such topics as the chemistry and dynamics of partial melting in the lowermost crust and upper mantle (including \"crust-mantle interactions\" during active periods of crustal growth), segregation of melt from the lowermost crust, and migration and transfer of magma upwards through the crust.  The key speakers at this conference will all address these main processes, but from the viewpoint of different expertise and methodologies.  Field trips in the Ivrea Zone compose half of the meeting, as they not only provide direct observation of the different levels in the crust but many opportunities for discussion.    In this proposal, the P.I.s request funds for graduate student travel assistance to this Penrose conference.  Participation of young scientists is vital to the success of the meeting and to their own professional development.  By attending the conference, graduate students will have many opportunities in which to meet geoscientists researching the same field of interest, but with different expertises.  It also allows them to interact with the  more mature scientists and to have a chance to participate in several different field trips in a superb geologic setting.  And, as most of the Penrose conference will be discussion-oriented, it is hoped that the students will find new confidence in expressing their views as a result.  The budget is drawn up so that significant partial support can be provided to approximately 10-11 participating students.  It is hoped that the home institution will also be able to contribute to the students' participation costs.",
