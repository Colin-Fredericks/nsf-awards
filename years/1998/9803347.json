 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Proposal: DMS 9803347  Principal Investigator:  Shing-Tung Yau      We propose to apply techniques of nonlinear partial differential equations   to solve several problems in geometry: the problem of defining center of   gravity, angular momentum in general space time and their applications to   the nonlinear stability of Schwarzchild solution.  The problem of studying   coupled Einstein-Dirac equation and their physical significance.  The   problem of applying nonlinear analysis to simplicial complices, including   graphs and buildings that can be used in combinatorial questions and   discrete group theory.  The problem of deforming Riemannian metric by using   Hamilton's equation and understanding their long time behavior that may   lead to understanding of topology of three manifolds.  We also want to   study the space of Lagrangian three manifolds in Calabi-Yau manifolds whose   moduli space will lead to understanding duality questions in string theory.    The success of this proposal will bring in strong interaction between   mathematics and modern and classical physics.  Here classical physics   include general relativity, where strong geometrical and analytical   technique play a very important role.  Modern physics includes String   theory whose impact on mathematics has been tremendous.  The study of   nonlinear system of equations should give a breakthrough in understanding   low dimensional geometry and topology .  A thorough understanding of such   equations should bring in new technique to solve difficult problems in   applied mathematics.  Hopefully, eventually some fluid equations can be   treated by similar technique.",
