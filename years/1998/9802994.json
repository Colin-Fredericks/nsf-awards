In recent years the quality of extragalactic x-ray observations has been steadily increasing and is expected to undergo another unprecedented multiplication in sensitivity and precision with the launching of the AXAF satellite next year.  The spatial scale of AXAF are ideally suited for observations of hot gas in ellipticals.  Ellipticals are not only the brightest x-ray galaxies, they also create enormous displays of radio emission and harbor massive black holes in their centers.  Most massive ellipticals and their component stars are thought to be very old, formed by the merging of young galaxies in the early history of the universe.  The PI has found evidence that most of the hot interstellar gas in bright ellipticals is also very old and is circumgalactic, occupying the outermost regions of the dark halos far beyond most of the galactic stars.      The program  begins with one dimensional numerical gas dynamic studies seeking a self consistent origin of the very old, very hot circumgalactic gas.  Evidently, the circumgalactic gas first accumulated in the same cosmological inflow that formed the young elliptical.  This gas may also be heated and enriched with heavy elements by supernovae of massive first generation stars.  The effects of galactic rotation, tidal exchange of hot gas between galaxies, etc. will be added as the project progresses.  These additions involve two or three spatial dimensions.  ***",
