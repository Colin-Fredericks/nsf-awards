 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prescott College has been conducting field courses for  undergraduates in the Gulf of California, and  particularly in the area around Bahia Kino, Sonora,  Mexico, and the Midriff Island region of the Gulf of  California, for nearly thirty years.  Although it is a  small liberal arts school, its mission emphasizes field  studies and experiential approaches to science and  environmental studies.  The college recently purchased a  small field station on the coast of the Gulf of  California near the town of Bahia Kino, Sonara, Mexico  and has been offering field courses and facilitating  research at the station since the fall of 1992.  With the  growth of the college, the creation of a Master of Arts  program and increases in enrollment and use of the field  station, the college has expanded its commitment  to the Prescott College Kino Bay Center for Cultural and  ecological Studies by appointing a director,hiring a  manage, increasing operating budgets and committing to a  broader mission for the station,particularly in the area  of support for scientific research, independent studies  and graduate students. Although the station is a small  offers unparalleled  access to a unique and fragile  bioregion, which is coming under increasing human  pressures.  It is only field station on a 400-mile  stretch of Sonoran Desert coast from Puerto Penasco in  the north to Guaymas in the south.  This project will  develop an intelligent, coherent, long-range plan that  will improve the undergraduate curriculum, create  opportunities for graduate research at the station,  define research priorities and identify the facilities  and equipment needs to properly support research in  marine and desert ecology, island biogeography,cultural  anthropology and human impact on fisheries.  The intent  is to create a field station that supports and  blends  qualify field research with undergraduate field courses  and graduate studies.",
