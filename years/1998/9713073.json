Under this award, the  Principal Investigator will use numerical simulations and detailed analysis of  dynamics to investigate the interaction of topographically forced gravity waves and  the terrestrial atmospheric boundary layer (ABL).  The Principal Investigator will  investigate: how the perturbations to the lower troposphere due to evolving mountain  waves create boundary layer flow variability; and  the influence of the diurnally  evolving ABL on mountain wave characteristics, such as momentum transport,  breaking, and reflection.  An understanding of the feedbacks between these two  atmospheric phenomena will also be pursued.        Analysis will focus on results from a non-hydrostatic, primitive equation,  mesoscale model, which will be run for a series of 3-dimensional, idealized  simulations of increasing complexity.  There will be three types of control  simulations: 1) the diurnal cycle of boundary layer flow without mountain wave  influence, 2) mountain waves without boundary layer influence, and 3) ducted lee  waves without boundary layer influence.   Particular attention will be given to  periods when the mountain wave is breaking and micro-timescale interactions are  likely.         It is expected that these studies will yield a far more complete understanding  of how topographically induced gravity waves and the lower tropospheric boundary  layer mutually interact.  Potentially this research could yield insights and  improvement in forecasting of the severity of wind gusts in complex terrain   ***",
