 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804817  O'Keefe    Proposed experimental work is aimed at the synthesis of new  materials with bonds to nitrogen and carbon,  involving the  p block metals (zinc, cadmium, gallium, indium, thallium,  silicon, germanium and tin).  This work is expected to lead  to new compositions with useful properties such as  microporous materials.  Other synthetic avenues to be  explored include ternary nitrides and nitride-carbides of  the early transition elements.  Characterization will  include powder neutron diffraction studies of orientational  order-disorder.  Theoretical studies will be directed to  topological aspects of structure, with a view to enabling  computer recognition of structures, and to the discovery of  new kinds of possible structures for covalent and framework  materials.  %%%  A program of synthesis of new inorganic materials is  proposed.  Particular emphasis is on compounds containing  carbon and nitrogen that have useful properties such as high  porosity which will make them candidates for a variety of  technological applications.  Parallel theoretical studies  will be aimed at the design of new structures that can be  realized as inorganic materials with novel properties such  as new kinds of semiconductors.  A unique aspect will be the  active interplay of these two components of research.  ***",
