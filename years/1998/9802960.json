Abstract:    A theoretical investigation of the \"plug in\" property in the context of  non and semiparametric models.  The intention of the investigators is   to characterize non and semiparametric models in which the outcomes of   appropriate fitting procedures can be safely plugged in for a broad   range of uses, and the study of model selection criteria when the loss   function reflects the goal of fitting some features of the data well   rather than a global fit.    This project includes:    *Further development of a theory for testing parametric or   semiparametric hypotheses in a semi or non parametric context.    *Further development of the theory of inference for Hidden Markov   Models.  The investigators propose extension to state space models.    *Development of new procedures and analysis of existing procedures for   estimating fixed effects and prediction of random effects using   semiparametric models for longitudinal and/or \"pharmacokinetic\" data.    *Further development of the theory and practice of selecting m in the  m out of n bootstrap     *An examination of the sensitivity to choice of stochastic model in the  construction of phylogenetic trees    Tests and diagnostics for semiparametric models such as those the   investigators intend to continue to develop are useful in a number of   areas.  For instance, the Black Scholes option pricing formula is   widely used in finance.  One of the methods the investigators have  already developed show the invalidity of the formula for large data   set and points to plausible more realistic models.  Phylogenetic trees  are used not only for representing evolutionary relationships among  species of animals and plants but also, as in the case we are g oing  to study, important families of proteins.  Studying the types of  models that lead to plausible evolution trees should also lead to  pattern recognition algorithms which will be useful in classifying  protein families and hence to relating new proteins to families whose  properties are known.  This is a major activity in the search for new  bioactive compounds in biotechnology.",
