 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725709  Archuleta    This research involves the investigation of dynamic earthquake  fault rupture by means of state-of-the-art finite element computer  codes.  Earthquake fault rupture is a very complex physical  phenomenon that is currently an active area of study in the  seismological community.  Ground motion recordings during many  recent earthquakes have emphasized that an understanding of the  dynamics of earthquake fault rupture is crucial in understanding  the observed ground motion, especially on the hanging wall of dip  slip faults.  In particular, in the case of non-vertical faulting,  the complicated interaction between seismic waves and the rupture  process may lead to profound effects in the rupture propagation and  resultant ground motion.  Many studies have attempted to create  analytical or numerical models of earthquake fault rupture, but  most have required extensive simplifications and approximations to  make the dynamic equations solvable.  The finite element method  will be used to advance our understanding of strong motion as  affected by the free surface for a dipping fault, and as affected  by the particular friction law used in the modeling.  This research  is a component of the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program.      ***",
