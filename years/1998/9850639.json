 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Engineering Technology Department at Western Kentucky University is in the process of upgrading its electrical engineering technology curriculum. As part of the curriculum revision, the Department will offer both classes and laboratories on fiber optic communications. The Department currently has insufficient fiber optic equipment to provide quality laboratory experiments for students; therefore, funding is requested for laboratory equipment to be used to analyze the transmission and reception of signals over fiber optic communications links. The fiber optic equipment will be utilized as follows:  1. provide a quality laboratory experience to support an electrical engineering technology fiber optics communications class,  2. provide support for the electrical engineering technology senior project classes,  3. provide training in the form of continuing education classes for local industry and high school math and science teachers throughout Western Kentucky University's designated service area in South Central Kentucky,  4. provide portable capabilities to conduct demonstrations in rural high schools that otherwise would not have this exposure, and  5.provide support for Physics 103 (Light, Color, & Vision) classroom lectures and laboratory exercises and Physics 441 (Optics) lecture & Physics 404 (Laboratory) courses.",
