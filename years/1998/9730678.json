 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730678  Marchetti  Theoretical research will be conducted with the goal of  understanding the dynamical properties of various spatially  extended condensed matter systems.  A major part of the  research focusses on the nonequilibrium dynamics of periodic  media driven through disorder.  Examples of such systems  include flux lattices in type-II superconductors, charge  density waves in anisotropic conductors and the magnetically-  induced Wigner crystal in a two-dimensional electron gas.  As revealed by recent experiments, the interplay of  interaction, disorder and drive results in a complex  dynamics that is poorly understood.  The main goals of this  work are to develop a theoretical framework for the  description of these nonequilibrium systems and to map out  their nonequilibrium phase diagrams.    Closely related problems that will also be investigated  arise in microscopic models of friction and lubrication.  One important difference is that inertial terms, negligible  for overdamped systems such as flux lattices, may be  important in this case and change the nature of the sliding  state.  A key objective is to understand the relative  importance of surface roughness and bulk elasticity in  yielding dissipation.    Another effort more directly continues past research on flux-  line arrays in type-II superconductors.  The focus is on the  physical consequences of entanglement and longtudinal  correlations which are probed experimentally by  magnetization measurements and transport experiments.  Both  analytical work, aiming at a two-fluid hydrodynamics capable  of describing both entangled and disentangled components of  flux liquid, and numerical work, addressing the stability of  the transverse Meissner effect against point disorder, are  described.  %%%  Theoretical research will be conducted on a class of  problems which describe the behavior of the high temperature  superconductors.  These type of problems are very common and  the results will also impact studies of friction, charge   transport in periodic media and novel phases at low  temperatues.  ***",
