Dr.  Cao intends to continue his work on  Gromov's minimal volume gap conjecture jointly with his coauthors.  Using the F-structure theory developed by Cheeger and Gromov, he would  like to study the minimal volume gap conjecture for complete  aspherical manifolds.  Cao also plans to continue his study on  isoperimetric inequalities on simply-connected riemannian manifolds of  non-positive sectional curvature.  As an intermediate step towards  understanding this isoperimetric problem, he hopes to study the total  Gauss-Kronecker curvature for smooth compact convex hypersurfaces in  Cartan-Hadamard manifolds.  In addition, Cao plans to continue his  study of the sign of the Euler number of compact aspherical manifolds,  especially in the complex case.    This project focuses on the study of global geometric shape of  non-positively curved spaces.  The examples of non-positively curved  spaces include flat tires and surfaces with more than two holes, such  as pretzels.  There are also examples of higher dimensional  non-positively curved spaces.  Our universe can be viewed a  3-dimensional space of zero curvature.  Dr.  Cao is trying to  investigate diameter, volume, spectrum and other geometric data of  those spaces.  Cao has also been interested in the study of the  shortest closed curves on non-positively curved spaces.  He has  already shown that two such surfaces with possible cusps are isometric  if and only if the data of lengths of all shortest closed curves on  the two surfaces are identical.  The data of lengths of all shortest  closed curves on a closed surface M is called the marked length  spectrum of the space M. The study of marked length spectrum on spaces  with boundaries has a number of applications in modern industry and  geologica l sciences.  In addition, the research of spaces of dimension  10 and 26 have played a crucial role in the theoretical physics of the  unification of four fundamental forces in our universe.",
