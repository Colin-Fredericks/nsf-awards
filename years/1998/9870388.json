The award enables the PI to return to a stimulating research environment after several years of full-time involvement in education, and to take the first step towards diversifying her research, crucial for continued professional growth.  The visit will also enable her to build invaluable ties with a strong research university, and thereby benefit her home institution.  The research objective is to gain proficiency in probabilistic and on-line techniques, for which there is abundant expertise at the chosen host institution.  The PI proposes to apply her expertise in MANets by (i)developing probabilistic graph models for MANets to support systematic simulation studies, and (ii) exploring probabilistic and on-line algorithms for routing in MANets.",
