 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organizations often look to other organizations as models for what they do.  Recent research has shown organizations sometimes imitate the most common practices ( frequency imitation), the practices of large or prestigious organizations (trait imitation), or practices that appear to have a good outcome (outcome imitation).  Most important work in this area has assumed that if many organizations imitate, they will all tend to look alike over time.  This research explores the important contrasting possibility that imitation can lead to innovation and complexity in practices, rather than similarity.  The paper uses inductive, qualitative analysis of fine grained interview data from a two year study of 40 manufacturing firms in three industries, and a sample of 14 universities in seven countries.  We will examine (1) whether organizations use more than one imitation rule, (and produce new mixes of practices) (2) whether they combine different rules in patterned ways (producing systematic patterns in mixes of practices) and (3) what impact the imitation processes have on (a) innovation at the organizational level (b) innovation at the level of whole groups of organizations (organizational populations).  The research will contribute to scholarly research on vicarious learning by organizations and population level learning by advancing understanding of how new bundles of practices arise in populations of organizations.  It will have value to practitioners as well.  For example, contemporary firms often 'benchmark' other organizations.  This research will suggest conditions under which adopting practices form other organizations will be more likely to create unintended problems or advantages for both the imitating organization and the industry to which belongs.",
