The principal investigator is attempting   to construct a symplectic structure on any manifold endowed with a  Lefschetz pencil (a kind of singular fibration originally discovered  in algebraic geometry).  He has already solved the problem in  dimension 4; a solution in all dimensions, together with recent work  of Donaldson, will give a complete topological characterization of  those manifolds admitting symplectic structures: They are precisely  those that admit Lefschetz pencils.  (A key part of the problem is  suitably to define Lefschetz pencils in this generality.)  A related  topic concerns Stein surfaces (affine analytic varieties of complex  dimension 2).  There are many fundamental existence questions here,  for example, what 3-manifolds arise as boundaries of Stein surfaces,  how many Stein surfaces have a given 3-manifold as boundary, and how  many contact structures are induced on a given 3-manifold by such  Stein surfaces?  These questions are amenable to the principal  investigator's current techniques of describing Stein surfaces as  handlebodies on Legendrian link diagrams in connected sums of copies  of S1 x S2.  The principal investigator is also currently writing a  graduate text on 4-manifolds and Kirby calculus with A. Stipsicz and  is advising two PhD students and an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow.       An n-manifold is a space that on small scales looks like Euclidean  space of dimension n.  For example, the space in which we live is a  3-manifold, and the universe (space-time) is a 4-manifold.  As such,  manifolds play a central role in mathematics, physics, and to some  extent, various other sciences.  Symplectic and contact structures  first appeared in classical physics (Hamiltonian dynamics) but have  since become important in pure mathematics (geometry, topology,  analysis) as well.  It is a basic unsolved problem to determine which  manifolds can have s ymplectic or contact structures.  This project  aims for a complete answer in the symplectic case and for additional  understanding of the contact case.  The project should also shed light  on basic unsolved problems regarding the possible shapes of 3- and  4-manifolds.  ***",
