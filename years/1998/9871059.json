 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9871059  Evenson  Cosmic rays of galactic origin are deflected by the magnetic fields, which originate in the sun and carried outward into interplanetary space by the solar wind. Thus, researchers can detect disturbances in the solar wind by monitoring the arrival of the cosmic rays at Earth, and some mapping of the solar wind is even possible by measuring both the direction and flux of the cosmic rays.  A confusing aspect of actually making measurements from Earth's surface is that the incoming cosmic rays are also deflected by Earth's magnetic field.  It is for that reason that one can actually determine the direction of origin of those cosmic rays that strike the atmosphere.  However, because of the constant changes in the magnetic field it is quite valuable to make measurements of the cosmic flux while transporting a detector over a wide range of magnetic latitudes to larger fixed sites.  This Major Research Infrastructure award will build a modern cosmic ray monitor to be located on one of the two USCG icebreakers which are used annually to break a channel into the US Antarctic station, McMurdo.   When combined with a similar, but older, unit that is provided by the University of Hobart (Australia) it will be possible to make annual latitudinal surveys from Seattle to McMurdo and other sites, where detectors are located, with occasional trips to the Arctic.  A significant amount of the necessary new equipment will be provided by the University of Tasmania (Australia).  ***",
