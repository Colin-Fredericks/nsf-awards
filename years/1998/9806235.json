Development of a comprehensive model requires understanding of water mass circulation and its effects on phytoplankton productivity and sedimentation.  Latitudinal temperature gradients that today play a critical role in ocean circulation were reduced and therefore significantly different from today.  There are two basic, underlying driving mechanisms for circulation in the epeiric seas of Greenhouse times: 1) circulation dominated by wind direction and strength (e.g. Erickson and Slingerland, 1990; Glancy et al., 1993); and 2) circulation dominated by density contrasts resulting from a combination of salinity and temperature alterations as water moves through the meridional seaways (Hay, 1988, 1989; Hay et al., 1993).  Although recently there have been significant advances in efforts to numerically model density and wind-driven circulation in the Western Interior Sea (Jewel, 1993 and Slingerland et al., 1996), geologic data available in the literature is insufficient to critically test these models.  Where available, stable Oxygen and Carbon isotopes taken from species specific planktonic and benthic foraminifers can be used to reconstruct the vertical relative density profile of the water column (Fisher and Arthur, 1994).  Unfortunately, in many Western Interior strata the foraminifers have undergone partial diagenesis and geochemical analysis is not meaningful.  Thus, a different relative density proxy is required.  The investigator proposes that a focused analysis of the porosity of planktonic foraminifera from selected sites in the Western Interior Basin will provide evidence to resolve spatial differences in relative density of seawater needed to understand the nature of seaway circulation.\r\n\r\nPlanktonic foraminiferal porosity, measured on SEM photographs, will be used as a density proxy.  B\u00da (1968), Frerichs et al. (1972), and B\u00da et al. (1973) have concluded that test porosity in modern foraminifera can be used as an indicator of water temperature (which they interpreted as a density indicator).  Frerichs and Ely (1978) applied this hypothesis to foraminifera sampled from the Cretaceous Western Interior of the United States.  As predicted by the hypothesis, they found that test porosity in modern foraminifera can be used as an indicator of water temperature (which they interpreted as a density indicator).  Frerichs and Ely (1978) applied this hypothesis to foraminifera sampled from the Cretaceous Western Interior of the United States.  As predicted by the hypothesis, they found that test porosity increased toward lower latitudes.  The investigator's Research Planning Grant supported the conclusions of Frerichs and Ely (1978), showing a trend of increasing porosity toward the warmer, southern latitudes.  There may also be an additional influence on porosity from freshwater near some coastal areas of the WIS.\r\n\r\nThe geographic distribution of relative water density (porosity) will be mapped.  Water density differences are reflected in the topography of the sea surface; lighter water forms hills and more dense water forms low areas on the sea surface.  Topographic differences in the ocean surface cause water to flow downhill.  Seaway topography will be used to reconstruct the density driven circulation.\r\n\r\nThe investigator will subsample already collected material and collect additional sites.  By focusing on well-defined stratigraphic intervals, and sampling a broad latitudinal transect of the basin, reasonable estimates of relative water mass density and oceanographic dynamics for the Western Interior Sea can be interpreted from the porosity data.  The main objectives of the project are to: 1) determine the relative density of water masses (by examining planktonic foraminifera porosity); 2) determine the latitudinal variations in water mass density from Boreal (Canada) to Tethyan (Texas) source areas (by examining variations in porosity from sites along a N-S transect of the basin), and map the density gradients through the seaway; 3) determine the temporal stability and dynamics of water mass density for well defined and geologically significant time periods (stratigraphic sections representing about 1m.y., spanning a discrete transgressive episode during the Greenhorn marine cycle of the Western Interior Sea)\r\n",
