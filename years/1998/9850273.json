 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three year project which includes students from the Gateway Technical College in WI, Triton College in River Grove, IL, and the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, PA. The partners in this collaboration also includes The Center for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica (CARA), Trek Bicycle Corporation, and the Antarctica Support Associates (ASA). The project will promote a technologically advanced workforce, develop an innovative technology curriculum, and form strong linkages among artists, scientists, and technicians. Using problem based learning it will combine collaborative student design and fabrication projects with classroom curriculum based on real problems presented by the extreme conditions at Amundson-Scott South Pole Station. The long range impact of the project is to provide a better working environment for technicians working in extreme environments. Students will hone their high tech skills through apprenticeships which involve Gateway and Triton students working under the direction of polar engineers at the Yerkes Observatory. The project will involve 150 students yearly including 10 apprentices. Students may earn 3-academic credits for their participation.",
