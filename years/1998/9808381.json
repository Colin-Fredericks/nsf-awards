 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cox\r\n98038381\r\nGenome rearrangements accompany the developmental process in many organisms, but nowhere is genome reorganization more extensive than during macronuclear development in ciliated protozoans. During that process, the old macronuclei are destroyed and new ones are developed from the micronuclei, accompanied by the fragmentation of the micronuclear chromosomes and the amplification of the fragments. A substantial fraction of the micronuclear genome is also jettisoned in the form of thousands of site-specific deletions (internal eliminated sequences, or IES elements).\r\nThe development of an in vitro system for two of the developmentally programmed DNA deletion reactions in Tetrahymena thermophila will be continued. A mechanistic explanation for the deletion pathway will be investigated. The focus is on two of the IES elements. Evidence from several laboratories have suggested a transposition-like mechanism for this excision. A double-strand cleavage at one end of the IES element would be followed by strand transfer via a one-step trans-esterification mechanism to generate the deletion junction on one DNA strand. Additional steps are required to process the DNA branch left in the other DNA strand. An in vitro system for the strand transfer step of this reaction has been achieved. The purification of the enzymes responsible for the observed reaction will be continued while searching for complementary enzymatic activities and exploring in vitro reaction mechanisms. A completely reconstituted in vitro system would likely open the way for biochemical analysis not only of the deletion reactions, but also of many other processes in the unusual DNA metabolism of ciliated protozoans. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is a complete molecular description of the deletion pathway, derived from studies of an in vitro system reconstituted form purified enzymes and substrates. \r\n\r\nAlthough the described work is focused on mechanism, it should also contribute to a better understanding of the evolutionary origin of the IES elements as well as their function during macronuclear development. It will also contribute to a more complete appreciation of recombination mechanisms in general which is relevant and important because recombination processes are the molecular means by which gene therapy is being or will be achieved.\r\n",
