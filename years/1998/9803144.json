First, we are studying function  theory, for functions and sections of bundles, on manifolds with a  lower curvature bound.  Typically, we are interested in spaces of  harmonic functions or sections which satisfy certain growth conditions  on complete noncompact manifolds.  As is evident from our prior  research, this problem is closely related to uniform eigenvalue  estimates on compact manifolds for both functions and sections of  bundles.  This second problem has an interesting connection to the  study of asymptotics for semiclassical limits in mathematical physics  and to questions which come from complex differential geometry.  Second, we are studying convergence and compactness of minimal  surfaces with an emphasis on the case where there is no a priori area  or total curvature bound.  If the area of a sequence of minimal  surfaces is unbounded, a classical limit cannot exist; however, often  we can extract geometrically interesting generalized limits.  There  are examples where, for topological reasons, such sequences of  embedded minimal surfaces with controlled topology can be constructed.    This project has two main directions both of which involve the  interplay between geometry and analysis.  The first direction involves  the study of Laplace operators on manifolds.  Our primary interest is  in how the basic properties of these differential operators depend on  the geometry of the space.  This sort of question is fundamental and  has been relevant in many different areas of mathematics (including  geometry, topology, complex geometry, and mathematical physics).  The  second main direction of this project is to study spaces of minimal  surfaces in three manifolds.  Minimal surfaces, which are critical  points for area, are interesting physical, geometric, and analytic  objects.",
