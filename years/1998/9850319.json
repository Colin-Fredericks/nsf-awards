 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project implements a sequence of dissemination and teacher training activities over 20 months for instructional materials developed under a previous grant (DUE 9553689). The materials form a comprehensive two-semester course in physics for technicians and other audiences. The materials emphasize conceptual understanding of fundamental ideas (as opposed to routine application of formulas to template problems) and active learning by students (which makes ideas vivid to the senses, not just leaving ideas as abstract concepts). The course contributes to the core education of technicians, making them more thoughtful in their work, more flexible within their companies, and adjustable in their employment throughout their careers. The dissemination and teacher training activities include: a teacher's manual to guide instructors in the use of the materials; modularization to make the material usable in a custom publishing format and as stand-alone demonstrations; summer workshops to train pairs of community college/high school teachers in use of the materials; Science Saturdays conducted in Austin by the development team and by the summer teacher pairs who return home to become \"teachers teaching teachers\"; workshops at the major professional meetings of groups like ITEA, AVA, NSTA, AAPT, and statewide directors of tech-prep programs;  expansion of a Web site to include a listserv/chat room format in which teachers can share ideas and ask questions; and continued interaction with major publishers.",
