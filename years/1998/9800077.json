One project will investigate general-purpose combinatorial extensions to the concept of an algebraic modeling language.  New forms of discrete variables and constraint operators will be designed through a study of optimization models in production control, location, routing, cutting, and other highly combinatorial applications; a general solver that can deal with these new forms will be constructed with the help of recent advances in software for constraint logic programming.  Extensions to partly combinatorial problems will be studied, and possibilities for algebraic directives that assist in the solution of very large or hard problems will be considered.  Another project will investigate general-purpose graphical modeling environments for network optimization problems, based on the idea of an algorithmic toolkit. New developments in object-oriented system design will be applied to promote the toolkit's portability and extendability.  Additional features will be studied and developed to facilitate prototyping in new applications, by allowing new optimization approaches to be defined in a high-level pseudocode or to be built from combinations of existing tools.\r\n     Results of this research are expected to lead to more productive use of combinatorial optimization techniques in manufacturing and service operations.  The primary goal of the projects is to bring such techniques to a greater range of users, by creating more accessible general-purpose facilities for development of new combinatorial optimization applications.  By reducing the time and cost associated with prototyping new models and methods, the projects will also help to extend the variety of applications for which a discrete optimization approach is a practical alternative to heuristic search.  The results are expected to be of greatest benefit for problems that are highly combinatorial by nature, such as scheduling, sequencing, assignment, and network design, or that have significant combinatorial aspects due to such factors as fixed costs and capital spending alternatives.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
