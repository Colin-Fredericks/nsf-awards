 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science WRITE, a computer-supported learning environment, will offer an innovative solution to the challenging problem of helping undergraduate science students to write well, by directly facilitating the complex cognitive processes that are critical for success. The system's educational foundation is a technique called procedural facilitation, which fosters independence in high-level thinking as students develop from novice to expert writers. We will deliver Science WRITE through World Wide Web technology because it is uniquely suited for accomplishing these learning goals.    We will design, write, program, test, refine, and disseminate 10 interactive modules containing an array of learning activities that will help students develop their own independent processes for planning and revising scientific documents. We will integrate these modules with each other, with a document annotation system that we recently developed, with collaborative and knowledge-construction tools, and with links to other Web resources for disciplinary and discourse knowledge. The system will be designed for use by the nation's undergraduate students who have scientific writing projects in kinesiology.     Science WRITE will be the first comprehensive resource (in print or on line) that is grounded in cognitive research and that supports undergraduate science students through all the processes involved in planning and revising papers. In addition, the system will be designed as a research laboratory in which we can continue to investigate and refine strategies for helping students learn to write in scientific disciplines. Science WRITE will demonstrate the powerful potential of this educational approach to improve the quality of undergraduate writing and thinking.",
