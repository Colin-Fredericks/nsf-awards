A  wide range of organisms, from bacteria to humans, display  daily  rhythms  in  physiological and behavioral phenomena. These  rhythms  are  controlled  by  a biological time keeping  device  termed  the  circadian   (~24  hours)  'clock'.  Malfunctions  in  this   timing  mechanism  are  associated  with  numerous  disorders  in   humans,  including manic-depression, seasonal affective disorders (SAD), and  chronic sleep problems in the elderly. In addition, modern ailments  such  as  increased rates of accidents during rotating  work  shift  schedules and symptoms associated with 'jet-lag' are manifestations  of  the  strong  influence  that circadian  clocks  have  on  human  physiology  and  performance. Moreover, it is well documented  that  the  efficacy of many drugs, including those used for chemotherapy,  is  highly dependent on the time of drug delivery. A major goal  in  the  study  of daily rhythms is to try and understand how circadian  clocks  function.  To this end we are using the  powerful  genetics  available  in  the fruitfly as a model animal system to  study  the  mechanism  underlying  circadian  rhythms.  Interestingly,   recent  findings  demonstrate that the circadian clocks in fruit flies  and  humans   are  very  similar.  Funding  from  the  National  Science  Foundation (NSF) will be used to identify the individual components  that  are required for the assembly of a functional biological time  keeping  device. A main objective for the funding from  NSF  is  to  support graduate and undergraduate students who will participate in  the  development and execution of the research goals. As  a  result  young  scientists  will  be  trained in the  latest  techniques  in  biotechnology,   biochemistry  and  genetics.  Furthermore,   these  students   will  be  exposed  to  a  wide  spectrum  of  scientific  disciplines  in  the  life  sciences,  inc luding  neurobiology  and  behavior.  By  participating  in NSF  funded  research  at  Rutgers  University  students  will  also have  the  opportunity  to  attend  seminars and interact with other students and faculty. Finally,  it  is  anticipated  that findings from the research supported  by  NSF  will  be  published in peer-reviewed science journals and  as  such  will  contribute to a better appreciation in the general public  of  the  important role that circadian rhythms have on human physiology  and behavior.",
