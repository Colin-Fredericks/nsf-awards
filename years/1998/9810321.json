 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental goal of animals in nature is to produce healthy offspring. When choosing a partner an organism must decide whether the potential mate is the best individual available for meeting this goal. However, individual quality not absolute. It will be shaped by numerous external and internal factors. This research explores how the risk associated with searching for an alternative partner and the energy available to fuel assessment of a potential mates influences choice behavior. These factors often differ for males and females and differ across environments. As a consequence, the ideal partner will also vary. This research explores the role that risk in the environment (predation risk) and internal state (energy reserves) play in shaping pairing decisions in a stream-dwelling crustacean, allowing examination of the basic principles involved in partner choice. A combination of field surveys, laboratory-based experiments and biochemical assays of energy content will be used.\r\n\r\nLittle is currently known concerning the relationship between ecology, physiology and behavior in any choice system. This research will provide general insights into our understanding of the manner in which external and internal factors interact to explain expression of numerous different behaviors (mating, parental, competitive) both within and between animal populations in nature. This basic knowledge of choice behavior in nature is important for conservation efforts aimed at preservation of biological diversity.\r\n",
