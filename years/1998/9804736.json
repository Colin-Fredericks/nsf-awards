 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804736  There is a serious need for effective formal methods to construct  correct computer programs. This need becomes crucial for reactive  systems associated with many safety critical or economically  vital applications, such as computer network communication  protocols or air traffic control systems.  One promising approach  centers around the use of Temporal Logic,  a logical formalism for describing change over time.  Purely  manual temporal reasoning seems infeasible for large-scale  reactive systems. The goal of this research is to make  verification of reactive systems as automated as possible.  Automated verification is more reliable than manual verification.  It is also more likely to be of industrial utility, as it is  possible to offer fully automated push-button verification and  debugging tools. The basic idea is that certain problems  associated with (propositional) Temporal Logic are decidable, in  some cases efficiently. These include the model checking problem  (Is a program's global state graph a model of Temporal Logic  specification ?). This research investigates, the following key  technical issues: (i) Amelioration of the state explosion problem  in model checking; (ii) Reasoning about many homogeneous  processes; (iii) Development of a modular Research Model Checker;  and (vi) Efficient program synthesis.***",
