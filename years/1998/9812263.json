 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last ten years the Harvard Forest has developed an  integrated and cross-disciplinary research and educational program  involving researchers and students from across the northeastern  U.S. that focuses on the response of forest ecosystems to  disturbance and stress resulting from natural and anthropogenic  processes. This program is structured around five approaches: (1)  reconstructAve studies, (2) long-term measurement and observation,  (3) experimental manipulations, (4) integration of results within  our research group and collaboratively with other research groups,  and (5) application of results to policy issues in natural  resource management, conservation biology, and human health and  environment. A ten-year plan for the renovation and construction  of additional laboratories, office space, archival facilities, and  housing to accommodate growing numbers of visiting scientists and  students has just been completed. Critical areas for further  development of the facility are data management and  teleeommumcations. A development plan has been created to address  these areas. This project will (1) upgrade Internet connectivity  at the Harvard Forest, (2.) set up high performance file servers  with large disk capacity, and (3) upgrade the GIS Laboratory. The  second phase will extend full network connectivity to two  buildings recently renovated for visitor and student housing, and  to continue upgrades to the computers in the main facility. The  improvements supported by this project will have a profound impact  on visiting scientists, students, and staff, as well as virtual  visitors, through improved access to the Internet, improved local  connectivity, continued development of Harvard Forest resources on  the Web, and a state-of-the-art PC-based GIS Laboratory. The  larger research community will benefit from increased  opportunities for collaboration and advances in data management  that will result from these improvements.",
