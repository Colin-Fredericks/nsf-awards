 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tSome properties (e.g., rest masses) of the mysterious neutrinos remain elusive.  Discovery of these properties may well represent new physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics and could give us insights into the evolution of the universe.  In part, little is known about these particles because they interact so weakly that conventional laboratory experiments are rarely definitive. Serendipidously, however, neutrinos and neutrino interactions with matter may play a dominant role in the synthesis of the light nuclei in the early universe and in the synthesis of the heavy nuclei in supernova explosions. To the extent that we can understand the nuclear physics of these astrophysical environments, we may be able to employ them (that is, their observed nucleosynthesis products) as neutrino physics \"laboratories.\"  Conversely, new experimental insights into the properties of the neutrinos may allow us a better understanding of how nuclei were made in our universe.  This remains, afterall, a central problem of nuclear physics.  The work proposed here aims to exploit the symbiosis between neutrino physics and the nucleosynthesis of the light and heavy nuclei.  The goal of this work will be to make progress in understanding each of these issues.",
