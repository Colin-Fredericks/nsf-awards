 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid growth rate of women owned businesses throughout the world makes women critical actors in developed and emerging economies.  Despite their economic importance, women still own only a fraction of all enterprises and the size of their businesses as measured by sales and number of employees lags substantially those of men owned ventures.  This minority status is in stark contrast to women's representation in the labor force and raises questions about whether fewer women choose to be self-employed, or whether they exit the start-up process prematurely and consequently are underrepresented in self-employment numbers.   This project attempts to determine what factors affect the impact of women's participation in the entrepreneurial process by focusing on the very earliest stage of new venture creation.  We examine whether women encounter barriers during the gestation of their businesses that cause some to give up their efforts and disengage; or less extreme, whether others experience difficulties that imprint their businesses for constrained growth and limit future success.  The focus of the proposed project is to examine both differences in entrepreneurial intentions, and differences in the ways women and men construct their businesses.  In other words, the project focuses on how organizations actually emerge.   Four reasons have been suggested for why the start up process may differ for women and men.  Women have been viewed as having: (1) fewer resources and human capital to bring to the firm creation; (2) more limited access to opportunity structures; (3) different intentions for their firms; and (4) less beneficial social networks to assist the start up process.  Research that can substantiate these claims has been equivocal, and virtually none has addressed the gestation stage of a firm's existence.  A longitudinal design is adopted to follow nascent entrepreneurs across 24 months to determine the extent to which these factors explain differences in the experiences of women and men as they move their businesses from the conception stage to that of fledgling new firm status.   A random sample of U. S. households is screened to identify individuals at the initiation stage of new firm formation (nascent entrepreneurs), and a comparison group of typical adults not engaged in starting new firms.  Comparisons are made between the experiences of women and men starting businesses and their cohorts in the adult population.   The project has potential for impacting public policy.  If the attrition rate for bringing a new firm to fruition is higher for women than men and the proposed research can pinpoint probable causes, recommendations regarding appropriate assistance programs can be formulated.  The development and delivery of training, information or resource assistance could be targeted more specifically to the critical stages of the gestation process where they could make the most difference.",
