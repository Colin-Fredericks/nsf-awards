 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870092  Vaughn    The freshwater mussel (Bivalvia: Unionidae) fauna of North American  streams is the most diverse in the world, but is highly threatened and  declining at an alarming rate.  The consequences of this catastrophic  decline of an entire fauna go beyond the loss of species, because  mussels serve critical roles in the functioning of riverine  ecosystems.  Thus, the current decline in mussel species also  represents a loss of critical habitat and food resources for the  remaining aquatic fauna, and may alter the ecosystem functioning in  many North American rivers. In addition, there are likely benthic  macroinvertebrates that have coevolved with mussel assemblages, are  specifically dependent on them, and thus may also be declining.  The  Ouachita Uplands, in central and western Arkansas and southeastern  Oklahoma, U.S., represent one of the last strongholds of freshwater  biodiversity in North America and may represent one of the few areas  where conservation of an intact mussel fauna may be possible.   Freshwater mussels and associated benthic macroinvertebrates will be  surveyed in the major river systems of the Ouachita Uplands over a  period of three field seasons.  Mussels and benthic macroinvertebrates  will be quantitatively sampled and environmental parameters will be  measured at each site.  Mussel and benthic macroinvertebrate voucher  specimens will be deposited in the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History  and the Illinois Natural History Survey (crayfish).  Mussel tissue  samples will be deposited with the U.S.G.S. Leetown Science Center  genetic tissue repository and the Texas Parks and Wildlife Heart of  the Hills Research Station.  Mussel and benthic macroinvertebrate data  will made available on the internet. The data collected will be  applicable to a multitude of conceptual problems in biology, many of  which have important conservation implications.  In addition, the data  will provide a baseline for monitoring these areas in the future,  particularly in response  to the impending zebra mussel invasion.",
