 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our  most  successful Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)  systems  remain  too  tied to specific domains (`air travel' or  `business  news')  and  to  carefully pronounced, slow speech,  because  our  statistical  algorithms  do  not  deal  well  with  the   extreme  variation,  in  pronunciation,  word-choice,  and  grammar,  that  characterizes natural, conversational, speech.  The research goal  of  this CAREER project is to build better speech recognizers  by  taking  human psychological results on lexical processing, giving  them explicit probabilistic models, and integrating them into ASR  algorithms.   This  project is incorporating  part-of-speech  and  word frequency into probabilistic models of word pronunciation in  ASR.   This project is using distributional-vector models of word  meaning  in an ASR system to increase the probability of  a  word  occurring    near   similar   words,   compiling    probabilistic  dictionaries of verb-argument structure to help ASR systems.  The  educational  goal of this CAREER investigation is to  incorporate  computational, corpus-based, and probabilistic training into  the  undergraduate    and    graduate   curriculum    in    phonetics,  psycholinguistics,  computational  linguistics,   and   cognitive  science.  Through its research and educational facets, the CAREER  project  will help draw talented and knowledgeable linguists  and  psychologists  into ASR and related fields, and produce  research  with  a  direct  impact on ASR and its technical  and  commercial  implications.",
