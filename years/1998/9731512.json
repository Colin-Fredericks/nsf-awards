 "awd_abstract_narration": "HUNEKE,  97-31512        This award supports research  in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  The principal investigator will continue to investigate a group of long  standing questions centered around the process of reduction to positive  characteristic, especially in regard to the developing theory of tight  closure.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the relationship between  tight closure, reduction to positive characteristic, and vanishing  theorems in algebraic geometry such as the Kodaira vanishing theorem.  Closely related work will be done on questions concerning uniform  bounds in Noetherian rings, and in particular on the uniform Artin-Rees  conjectures.      This is research in the closely related fields of commutative algebra and  algebraic geometry. In essence these fields are quite similar to the  19th century study of equations and their solutions.  The relationship  between algebraic equations, such as polynomial equations, and geometry  goes back at least to Descartes and the idea of coordinatizing the plane.  Commutative algebra studies the solutions of such polynomial or power  series equations by forming an algebraic object, called a ring, which  consists of the 'generic' solutions.  The algebraic properties of  these generic solutions then give insight into the geometric and algebraic  nature of the equations. The field combines techniques from a number of  other areas including combinatorics, topology, and analysis.",
