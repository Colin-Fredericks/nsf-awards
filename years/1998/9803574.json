 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803574  Li   The objectives of this research are to study the properties of stochastic processes   together with the topological and geometrical properties of the underlying spaces, and    applications of the theory of diffusion processes. Both finite  and infinite dimensional    manifolds are to be considered (in particular path and loop spaces of Riemannian   manifolds).   Investigations will concentrate on the following problems:  the existence of a   (smooth) solution flow to stochastic differential equations,  asymptotics of stochastic   dynamical systems (including  moment estimates, almost sure estimates,   recurrence/transience, and stable manifold theory) and integration by parts formulae in   various situations. Special attention will be paid to the dynamics and geometry of   Hamiltonian systems perturbed by white noise. The study of backward stochastic   differential equations and stochastic differential equations driven by space-time   martingales will also be included.   The investigator shall continue her research in stochastic dynamical systems and   related topics. The asymptotics,  analytical properties  and geometrical properties of    solutions of stochastic differential equations are to be studied together  with the  geometry   and topology of the underlying spaces. Particular examples of  stochastic differential   equations including Hamiltonian systems  perturbed by white noise shall be investigated.",
