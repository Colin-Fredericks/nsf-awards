Biosensors detect  signals representing biological variables and convert them  to electrical signals; they serve as the interface between a  biologic system and an electronic system.  The several  objectives of the meeting are to provide insights into  ongoing research for the development of biosensors, to  describe examples of industrial successes in transforming  ideas into successful products, and to present information  about funding opportunities for collaborative  academic/industrial efforts. The symposium is well organized  and the speakers are leaders in the development of  biosensors.    This meeting is one of two seminars usually convened by  BEACON each academic semester to review highlights of  biomedical engineering research. BEACON is a joint project  of four educational institutions-University of Connecticut  at Storrs, the University of Connecticut Health Center, the  University of Hartford, and Trinity College.  The symposium  presentations are to be made by a group of eminent  researchers and the meeting is expected to elicit interest  from a national audience.  From 175-200 persons including 20- 30 students from BEACON affiliated institutions are expected  to attend.  Dissemination of results of the meeting will  occur in a printed publication for which funds are being  awarded by the Foundation.    Attendees at the meeting will learn about current  applications of state-of-the-art biosensors and gain an  insight to their future capabilities as this technological  area develops.  ***",
