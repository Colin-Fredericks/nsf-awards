 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, focusses on the characterization of transition metal  nanoparticles prepared by a process involving hydrogen reduction  and control of particle shape by the presence of capping polymers.   Professors El-Sayed and Wang and their students at Georgia Tech  will characterize the shape and composition of these nanoparticles  using high resolution transmission electron microscopy, parallel-  detection electron energy-loss spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-  ray spectroscopy, and Raman and FTIR vibrational spectroscopies.   The objective is to establish an understanding of the synthetic  parameters that control the shapes of these nanoparticles and their  properties.  The long-term aim of this work is to develop useful  nanoparticle structures for applications in heterogeneous  catalysis.  A new synthetic process for preparing transition metal  nanoparticles that can control their shape has been developed by  Professors El-Sayed and Wang at Georgia Tech.  This process  involves reduction of metal ions using molecular hydrogen in the  presence of polymers that cap the particle surface.  The factors  that are important in controlling the size, shape, and composition  of these particles will be determined using an array of surface  characterization methods, particularly high resolution transmission  electron microscopy.  The long-term goal of this work is to develop  a family of new low temperature heterogeneous catalysts for  industrial use.",
