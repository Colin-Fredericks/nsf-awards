Most of the REU interns of our program, who have completed their undergraduate degree, have entered various graduate programs (88% of African Americans, and 79% of students from the primarily undergraduate institutions).  We are requesting 3 years of support to continue our NSF-Supported REU site (15 summer interns) in the Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh.  Our goal is to introduce undergraduates from engineering and the sciences, especially undergraduates majoring in chemical engineering, chemistry, and biology at small colleges and universities to research activities.  Our educational philosophy upon which our program is based includes hands-on laboratory experimentation with advice and guidance supplied by a faculty mentor, and enriched by seminars and visits to industrial laboratories, as well as extracurricular social interactions.  We plan to continue recruiting from a great number of colleges and universities in and around the Western Pennsylvania region, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and to enroll a large number of students from the primarily undergraduate institutions (at least 50%) and the balance from research universities.",
