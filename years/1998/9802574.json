In the algebraic setup the\r\ngoal is to develop, following an idea of E. Witten, a new method in\r\nthe theory of algebraic functions of one variable over arbitrary field\r\nof constants using various quantum field theories over algebraic\r\ncurves. In particular, for the theory of free bosons this\r\n\"field-theoretical\" paradigm will provide a new proof of A. Weil's\r\nreciprocity law on algebraic curves. Development of this program will\r\nhave a broad impact on the class field theory of fields of algebraic\r\nfunctions with a possibility to work for algebraic number fields as\r\nwell. In the latter case the goal is to derive classical Gauss\r\nquadratic reciprocity law and its generalizations as \"conformal Ward\r\nidentities\" for quantum field theories.\r\n\r\nIdeas from physics, originated from the study of surrounding world,\r\nhave always played a pivotal role in the development of mathematics.\r\nRecently dramatic progress was made in the study of geometry and\r\ntopology in four dimensions by using methods of quantum field theory.\r\nIn a sense, special quantum fields on a four-dimensional manifold - a\r\ngeometric object in four-dimensional space - turned out to probe its\r\ngeometric and topological properties and by measuring their response\r\none gets a nontrivial information about the manifold. The goal of this\r\nproposal is to develop a similar method for studying algebraic and\r\narithmetic properties of surfaces and number fields (like the usual\r\nfield of rational numbers) by using quantum fields. Many fundamental\r\nproperties of these objects are discrete and so it is natural to study\r\nthem using quantum theory.  In particular, many classical results\r\nabout fields of algebraic functions and algebraic numbers, known as\r\nreciprocity laws, can be interpreted as conservation laws (like\r\nconservation of energy) in quantum field theory.  The main goal of the\r\nproposal is to develop a new paradigm based on quantum theory for\r\nstudying the fundamental laws that are satisfied by the very basic\r\nmathematical objects: algebraic numbers - solutions of algebraic\r\nequations with coefficients being rational numbers, and algebraic\r\nfunctions - solutions of algebraic equations with coefficients being\r\nrational functions.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
