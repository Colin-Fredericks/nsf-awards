 "awd_abstract_narration": "While it is widely recognized that breastfeeding is best for   infants, many women stop breastfeeding their infants earlier than   recommended because they believe they are producing insufficient   milk.  There is a debate about whether women who report   insufficient milk actually produce less breastmilk, or whether   the perception of milk insufficiency results from factors such as   lack of knowledge about how to breastfeed and inadequate social   support.  This study will investigate insufficient milk in women   in Esmeraldas City, Ecuador.  A combination of data on   breastfeeding behavior and beliefs, infant growth, maternal   nutritional status, and milk quantity and quality will be   collected from a sample of 72 breastfeeding women over a period   of 10 months. The project aims to understand breastmilk   insufficiency by 1) a thorough investigation of women's cultural   understanding of breastfeeding practices, 2) a longitudinal   investigation of biological factors such as maternal and infant   nutritional status, fat concentration of breastmilk, and volume   of milk intake by infants, and 3) a careful weighing of both   cultural and biological variables in relation to milk   insufficiency.  This will be the first study of milk   insufficiency to combine measures of infant milk intake, milk fat   content, and structured observations of breastfeeding to be   carried out in a developing country.                                                     \u00c1\u00a5/\u2563%\u00a2 ?\u00c2 \u00a9?\u2534 \u00a2\u2510\u2593\u00a2\u00a5\u2563\u00a5\u2510\u00a5\u2563?> ?\u2502\u2502\u2510\u255d\u00a2 \u2563> \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1   \u2593?\u255d/>\u00c1\u00a2  \u00bc\u00a9\u2563\u00a2 %/\u00a5\u00a5\u00c1\u255d ?\u2593\u00d5\u00c1\u2502\u00a5\u2563\u2514\u00c1 \u2563\u00a2 \u2563_\u2551?\u255d\u00a5/>\u00a5 \u00a5? \u2551\u255d\u00c1\u2551/\u255d\u2563>\u00c0 >\u00c1\u2534   _\u00c1\u00a5/%%/\u2593?\u255d/>\u00c1\u00a2 ?\u00c2 \u00a2\u2551\u00c1\u2502\u2563\u00c2\u2563\u2502 \u00a2\u00a9/\u2551\u00c1 />\u2524 \u2502?_\u2551?\u00a2\u2563\u00a5\u2563?>  \u00bf> /\u2524\u2524\u2563\u00a5\u2563?> \u00a5? \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 >\u00c1\u2534   \u2502\u00a9\u00c1_\u2563\u00a2\u00a5\u255d` \u00a5\u00a9/\u00a5 \u2534\u2563%% \u2593\u00c1 \u2510>\u2502?\u2514\u00c1\u255d\u00c1\u2524 \u2563> \u00a5\u00a9\u2563\u00a2 \u2551\u255d?\u00d5\u00c1\u2502\u00a5  \u2551?\u00a2\u00a5\u2524?\u2502\u00a5?\u255d/%  \u00c0\u255d/\u2524\u2510/\u00a5\u00c1    />\u2524 \u2510>\u2524\u00c1\u255d\u00c0\u255d/\u2524\u2510/\u00a5\u00c1 \u00a2\u00a5\u2510\u2524\u00c1>\u00a5\u00a2 \u2534\u2563%% \u2593\u00c1 \u00c1\u2524\u2510\u2502/\u00a5\u00c1\u2524 \u2563> \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u2514\u00c1\u255d` \u2551\u255d\u00c1\u2502\u2563\u00a2\u00c1   \u00c1\u252c\u2551\u00c1\u255d\u2563_\u00c1>\u00a5/% \u00a5\u00c1\u2502\u00a9>\u2563\u2557\u2510\u00c1\u00a2 \u255d\u00c1\u2557\u2510\u2563\u255d\u00c1\u2524 \u00c2?\u255d \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u2563>\u2514\u00c1\u00a2\u00a5\u2563\u00c0/\u00a5\u2563?> ?\u00c2 \u2593?\u255d?> \u00a9`\u2524\u255d\u2563\u2524\u00c1\u00a2",
