 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. T. Patrick Culbert, Mr. Brian McKee will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. His research focuses on a comparison between two archaeological sites, Ceren and San Andres, both occupied during the Classic Period and located in the Zapotitan Valley, El Salvador. The sites differ in terms of both position in a regional settlement system and of preservation. Ceren is unique in Middle America because it represents a Pompei like situation. The small rural village is buried under a protective layer of volcanic ash. Although most (although not all) inhabitants had time to flee before the cataclysmic volcanic eruption, they were able to take few of their possessions with them. Delicate organic materials such as storage gourds are well preserved and objects were left where they were used. The site therefore provides unparalleled insight into the range and spatial distribution of material culture. In the course of their activities, the Ceren people discarded objects which were no longer of use and trash pits similar to those preserved in many Middle American sites were discovered. It is very likely that the inhabitants of adjacent San Andres had a range of material culture and way of life similar, in most essentials, to their Ceren contemporaries. San Andres however was not subject to similar volcanic forces and abandonment occurred in a more gradual manner. Because discarded objects were not suddenly buried, preservation is not of the same high quality. Therefore a comparison of the two sites and a determination of systematic differences can give scientists insights into the nature of abandonment and post abandonment changes which pattern materials recovered through excavation. Likely material recovered from buried trash deposits will be similar. Assuming such to be the case, the differences in remains associated with house floors and surrounding surface areas will be particularly instructive.  Although research has been conducted at Ceren for many years, much less is known about San Andres. Mr. McKee will conduct systematic excavations at this latter site. A surface survey will be followed by a testing program and analysis of recovered artifacts. In addition to providing insight into preservation and abandonment processes, the data will allow for a comparison between rural hinterland and political center. The information will be of interest to many archaeologists and assist in training a promising young scientist.",
