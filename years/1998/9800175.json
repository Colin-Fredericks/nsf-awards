 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Delaware has completed three years of NSF-  supported research focused on increasing the number of students  with disabilities in scientific academic programs and professions.   This effort has focused on increasing the access to information by  students with disabilities necessary for success in education and  careers in science, engineering, and mathematics.  The project has  also emphasized hands-on opportunities for students with  disabilities studying these disciplines and providing the  technological tools that provide the students full participation in  these fields.    Specifically, research and development efforts have centered on  three critical areas:      .  Model outreach projects for high school and university       students.  This component includes an Internet-based mentoring       program, technology based workshops and summer programs,       internships, campus organizations and support groups, and a       campus lecture series focused on disability, education, and       employment topics.    .  Educational and professional development programs for parents       and educators.  These programs are designed to allow greater       advocacy by parents and increase the knowledge base of       educators.   Components include workshops and lecture series       open to all parents and educators covering topics related to       disability, education, employment, and assistive technology.        Additionally, both pre-service and in-service education of       pre-college science and mathematics teachers is provided at       the university by project staff.    .  Research and development of information access tools.        Information access tools are being developed to allow       individuals with disabilities use of laboratory instruments       and access to classroom and scientific information.  Research       will continue to focus on engineering solutions to information       access problems including tactile rendering of information,       haptic and sonification r epresentations of data, classroom       access and communication tools for the deaf and hard-of-       hearing, as well as alternative output and remote access       laboratory instruments.    To ensure a widespread and lasting impact, many of the program  components were established and operated in partnership with other  institutions, organizations, and projects.  Several of these  components have started the process of institutionalization through  their independent continuation or through institutional support.  This process of institutionalization will be continued during the  next three years building on the successes achieved during the  previous award.",
