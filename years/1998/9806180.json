 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on two issues in phonological theory, namely the problem of vowel-initial structures, and the notions of `base` and `reduplicant` in reduplication theory.  Most work on reduplication has assumed that reduplicants generally take some morphological constituent as their base and that prosodic factors constrain the shape of partial reduplicants.  However, recent work by the investigator on reduplication in a few Bantu languages challenges both these assumptions.  The implications of the work so far are limited, though, by the fact that the reduplication patterns of only a handful of the several hundred Bantu languages have been analyzed.  The goal of this project is to study this problem by surveying as much of the existing literature on Bantu reduplication as possible using the CBOLD facilities at Berkeley and by working with native speakers who are graduate students in the Berkeley area.    The significance of the project is to contribute to our knowledge of underdescribed and underanalyzed Bantu languages.  The research will also contribute to current theoretical understanding of possible reduplication systems and the interaction of constraints on reduplication with other areas of the grammar.  This visiting professorship award will improve the investigator's chances of obtaining a tenure track academic position by providing an opportunity to spend a year focussing on research and publications.  Berkeley is the ideal location for the project, since it is a research center for both Bantu languages and theoretical linguistics.",
