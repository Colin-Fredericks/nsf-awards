The  Conference will take place in the Nittany Lion Inn, on the campus  of  the   Pennsylvania  State  University,  University  Park,  PA.   This  conference will represent the second step along the much-needed route  towards  integration  of  information in  the  area  of  sensorimotor  control.  The  participation of the spectrum of the invited  speakers  will  make  it unique and attractive for potential participants.  The  Conference   will  cover  the  following  topics:  Neurophysiological  Aspects  of Sensorimotor Control of Movements; Perceptual Control  of  Movement;   Biomechanics;   Motor   Disorders;   Motor   Development;  Psychophysiology  of Movements; Models and Theories  in  Sensorimotor  Control.  All  topics will emphasize an integrative approach  to  the  study of adaptive behavior. The focus of this particular meeting will  be  on  the interactions between neurophysiological and biomechanical  structures and their sensorimotor functions.    The  Conference will include 14 invited presentations, free  podium  presentations,  and poster sessions. Invited speakers  were  selected  based  on  their  integrative  approach to  movement  studies,  their  outstanding contribution to different areas of sensorimotor  control,  particularly  to understanding the role of various neurophysiological  structures  and  of  biomechanical factors  in  the  coordination  of  voluntary  movements, and their international reputation.  Conference  abstracts  will  be  distributed  among  the  participants.   Invited  speakers  will write chapters that will be published  as  a  book  by  Human Kinetics Publishers.",
