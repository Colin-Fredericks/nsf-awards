 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from Seamless Solutions, Inc. uses virtual reality representations of a signer's head, facial expressions, and mouth to augment verbal and/or American Sign Language (ASL) communication, and it provides a means to animate these models using commands which can be transmitted over inexpensive, low bandwidth channels.  The objective of this project is to build on Seamless Solutions' current research and development in the long distance communication of sign language by virtual human representations or avatars.  Specifically, the project will explore the feasibility of using low-cost computer generated facial animations 1) to express emotion, 2) to enable lip reading, and 3) to augment signing with head movements that add emphasis to communication.  This technology will not only provide low cost, long-distance sign language communication, but will also supply more natural and rapid interaction between humans and computer applications.  Among those who will benefit form this research are the more than 500,000 hearing disabled Americans who are currently excluded from communicating in their most expressive idiom over long distance communications systems.  Moreover, the same technologies that will enhance visual communication for the deaf can also add expression to communications for persons with unimpaired hearing.  Facial animations can be licensed to education, communications, and entertainment software developers (including developers of games, PC-based software, digital TV, and videophones).  Such licensing would result in avatar use in 1) educational multimedia software; 2) computer games; 3) television programs; and 4) interact communications, where sound is utilized today.  When coupled with emerging technologies in voice recognition, natural language processing, and facial expression recognition, the avatars can be added to existing media without the cost of independently authoring their behavior.",
