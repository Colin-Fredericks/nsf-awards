As such, this  project has both a research and educational component.  Her  research component is based on a continuation of work initiated  under NSF Grant No. 94-10476.  It was aimed obtaining a better  understanding than now exists of the causes of foaming and  bulking problems associated with wastewater treatment by use of  suspended growth bioreactors as a step toward exercising control  of these problems.  Her new research objectives are to expand her  study of the role played by filamentous bacteria responsible for  causing these problems, optimize and validate procedures for  their detection and identification, and to apply nucleic acid  probes and molecular beacons in reactor studies to develop  rational control measures for foaming and bulking.    The Principal Investigator's educational component includes  improvement of existing courses dealing with water quality and  collaboration with Carollo Engineers, a consulting engineering  firm, to improve the design content of an undergraduate, senior  level course in water quality control.  Her education plan  includes integration of dynamic mathematical models, results of  her research and a relevant field experience into her graduate-  level course.  She also plans on development of a  workshop/graduate level laboratory course that reflects the  increasing importance of molecular biology procedures and their  application in environmental engineering practice.  Her plan is  to maintain strong contacts with several other environmental  engineering consulting firms, biotechnology and food processing  industries and municipalities for guidance in curriculum  development applicable to strengthening her research and teaching  activities.  ***",
