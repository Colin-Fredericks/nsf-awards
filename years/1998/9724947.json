FEMA intends to use the Action Plan  to initiate a Performance-Based Design Program for new and  existing construction.  This project will provide funds to  complement FEMA funding to support the participation of an  additional steering committee member selected from universities  who would represent the engineering research perspective in all  activities of the Project Steering Committee, in order to ensure  its inclusion in the resulting Action Plan.    This is an interagency collaboration in support of the National  Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) activities.  ***",
