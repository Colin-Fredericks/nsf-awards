 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731851  Hallgren    The American Meteorological Society (AMS) proposes that the National Science Foundation (NSF) join a well-established and respected graduate fellowship program available to all first-year graduate students in the area of atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrologic sciences.  The  AMS provides administrative costs of the program. Corporations and government agencies, as well as member contributions to the AMS Programs in Support of Science and Education, are the source of fellowship funds.    The AMS, founded in 1919, is a nonprofit, tax-exempt scientific and professional society. Interdisciplinary in its scope, the Society actively promotes the development and dissemination of information of the atmospheric and related oceanic and hydrologic sciences. The Society has its headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts, and also maintains an office in Washington, D.C.  The AMS has more than 11,000 members from the United States and about 100 foreign countries, and more than 135 corporation and institutional members, representing 40 countries.     The fellowship program has two goals.  The first is to help ensure that outstanding young scientists enter the fields of atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrologic sciences to meet the problems of the coming decade. The second is to provide sufficient resources to allow each recipient to pursue a full schedule of academic studies during the first year of graduate study, which will place them in a position to make contributions to their chosen field sooner. The fellowships are available to students entering their first year of graduate school in the fall of 1998, and are intended to permit maximum formal participation during the year.    The fellowship program, established in 1991, is now entering its seventh year. With this seventh year of the program, the AMS will have awarded over 70 graduate fellowships.",
