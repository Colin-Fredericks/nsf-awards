 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the Muskingum College Physics Department is developing a new curriculum for the algebra-based and calculus-based introductory physics courses as well as introducing new experimental techniques in the upper-level laboratory courses. The Workshop Physics curriculum that is currently being used for introductory courses at Muskingum College is being modified to include new modules that make use of dynamical modeling techniques and digital video methods for data collection. This project provides a digital videocassette camcorder and computer workstation for each group of three students in the laboratory. Students in the introductory physics courses use the camcorders to photograph experiments in projectile motion (including the effects of air resistance), center-of-mass motion, one and two-dimensional collisions, waves, fluid flow and electrostatic forces. They transfer the images to the computer and compare them to results of their model calculations made with spreadsheet or Dynamic Analyzer software. The curricular materials developed in this project are being made available for use at other colleges and universities. Students in the advanced physics laboratories use a new triggered video camera with one of the digital camcorders to study three-dimensional motion, do high-speed photography and record spectroscopic information. The three-dimensional motion analysis experiments include sports-related activities, which are be aimed at eventual use in introductory courses .",
