 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project to establish a 2+2 program to improve the preparation of technicians and technologists in a broad range of technology and science disciplines. This will be done through intensive summer programs, conferences, and internships. The program begins with an integrated course of study in eleventh grade. It will continue with context based, interdisciplinary mathematics-sciences-technology learning environment in grades eleven and twelve. It will feature a 5-week summer program for students during the summer between their senior year in high school and their freshman year in college. This summer workshop will emphasize integrating technology training with workforce skill development. SEATEC also will hold a Summer Conference for students, educators, and industry representatives. SEATEC will provide internships for students and training for teachers in technology, process education, and integrated learning. Phase I planning will focus on data collection and designing project procedures.",
