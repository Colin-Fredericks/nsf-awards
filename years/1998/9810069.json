 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810069  Koberstein    The proposes research program constitutes a fundamental study of  functional polymer surfaces directed toward the objective of  devising new methods for decorating polymer surfaces with  functional groups.  The specific approach adopted is the  molecular design and synthesis of surface active delivery  vehicles that  carry functional groups to the surface of a  polymeric matrix by self assembly processes. Two distinct but  integrated research thrusts are pursued:  a core program that  focuses on elucidating the equilibrium and dynamic surface  properties of end-functional and center-functional homopolymers  as model systems for functional polymer surfaces, and a directed  program of studies aimed at developing surface delivery vehicles  for decorating biomaterial surfaces.  The comprehensive core  research involves synthesis of model polymers,theoretical  modeling and experimental characterization of functional polymer  surfaces including development of a new surface.analysis  technique.  The applied research program is focused on decorating  commercial biomaterial surfaces with cell adhesion ligands and  growth factors that can induce the formation of bone cells at an  implant surface placed in vivo.  %%%  The proposed research describes novel methods that allow precise  controlof the chemical functionality at polymer surfaces and will  impact a broad range of polymer applications that ranges from  adhesives to lubricants and non-stick or release coatings.  Of  particular interest to society is the need to create new  biomaterial surfaces that are designed to effectively interface  with living tissues.  As the human lifespan has continually  increased there has emerged an urgent need for synthetic  replacements for damaged or missing tissue.  New methods are  described to synthesize the next generation of implantable  biomaterials that are not only biocompatible, but are designed to  induce a direct biological response such as bone regeneration.  This novel approach to ti ssue engineering has the potential to  improve the quality of life of many individuals who are in need  of tissueregeneration or repair.  ***",
