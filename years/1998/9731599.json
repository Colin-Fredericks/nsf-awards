The objective of this research is to understand the  role of the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in the regulation  of estrogen actions in the hypothalamus, the part of the  brain that plays a central role in reproduction.  The AhR is  generally considered as the receptor that binds dioxin and  dioxin-like environmental contaminants.  However, this  receptors has apparently been conserved throughout evolution  and, therefore, is likely to have ligands other than the  dioxins that have been produced only within the past 50  years.  Although the AhR has been studied in non-neural  tissue, virtually no studies have been conducted in the  brain.  In other estrogen-sensitive tissues, such as breast  tissue, activation of the AhR is anti-estrogenic.       Dr. Petersen recently discovered  that the genes for  AhR and estrogen receptor (ER) are co-localized in regions  of the hypothalamus that control ovulation.  Other recent  work has shown that a single dose of dioxin (which activates  the AhR) blocks the ability of estrogen to induce the  preovulatory surge of luetinizing hormone (LH) required for  ovulation.  Based on this finding, Dr. Petersen hypothesized  that activation of the AhR may interfere with specific ER  functions in hypothalamus.  To test this hypothesis, it will  be determined whether: (1) activation of the AhR alters  estrogen expression or receptor protein expression, (2)  activation of the AhR induces the gene expression of  specific hydroxylases that metabolize estrogen, thereby  decreasing hormone availability and creating neurotoxic  substances, and (3) known estrogen actions in the  hypothalamus, such as progesterone receptor induction and  changes in proopiomelanocortin, tyrosine hydroxylase and NPA  gene expression, are blocked by activation of the AhR.       Taken together, these studies will provide important  new insights into the mechanisms by which ligands for the  AhR might affect  ER-mediated events required for ovulation.  In addition, the proposed experiments will provide important  clues to help identify the endogenous ligand(s) for the  receptor.",
