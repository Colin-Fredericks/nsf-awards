 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804078  Current software design doctrine rests on largely structural  concepts: information hiding, spiral processes, delaying  decisions, program families, reuse, etc. These idiosyncratic  concepts are not explained or unified by scientific theory or  mathematical models. At their heart is a common emphasis on  flexibility in software products and processes. Flexibility  incurs costs, e.g., as investments in architecture. What has  remained unclear, even in principle, is what flexibility is  worth, on what parameters and relations its value depends, and  thus under what circumstances investments in it are warranted.  This work will appeal to the theory of real options in an attempt  to develop a scientific account of the value of  flexibility as a framework for understanding important software  design principles. Real options theory models the value of  flexibility in capital budgeting and corporate strategy through  analogies with financial options, such as call options on stocks.  Conditions for using arbitrage-based pricing are unlikely to hold  for many design decisions, so valuations will  sometimes depend on subjective estimates of parameters. Even so,  the real options view appears to provide an intellectual  framework within which designers can reason about the value of  flexibility as afforded by such mechanisms as modularity and  phased project structures.***",
