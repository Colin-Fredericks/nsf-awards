 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9761157  Wang    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project aims to develop an active strain gauge, to directly address the requirements of a new generation of sensor technology.  Monitoring the performance of structures during earthquakes using sensors is very important for earthquake hazard mitigation. Existing strain gauges, both the foil and fiber-optic types, with their excitation and signal conditioning are relatively expensive, require long lead wires to get to the interrogating point, have high power requirements, all of which makes instrumenting a large civil structure prohibitively expensive.  The choice of an active material such as polyvinylidede flouride (PVDF) as a strain gauge provides basic advantages in terms of the signal processing requirements, low power requirements, low noise threshold, and above all the ability to eliminate the usage of lead wires to interrogate the gauge.  The objectives of the current research is to prove the concept of a PVDF strain gauge and pave the way for the development a true self contained wireless strain gauge.    The potential commercial applications will be in the area of infrastructure monitoring.  The choice of PVDF will provide a relatively inexpensive material for the sensor, The active nature of the sensor will help in keeping the design of the basic signal processing rather simple, which will result in a low cost signal processing which will be easy to integrate with a RF circuit.  ***",
