 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project by a cultural anthropology student at Emory University will study the gender perspectives of men in a working class neighborhood of the Dominican Republic. While the island suffers relatively high rates of HIV infection, public health surveys have shown that Dominican women attribute high risk behavior to their partner's expectations.  This project will examine how men conceive of their norms of masculinity, sexuality and household responsibility. By combining demographic surveys of approximately 500 households, structured interviews with about 300 men in two categories, HIV infected, and neighborhood residents, behavioral risk assessment and intensive ethnographic interviewing, the student (a native Spanish speaker) will assess the relationship between men's normative models of masculinity and specific patterns of sexual decision-making. The student will test various hypotheses about the relation of masculine reputations and other behaviors concerning household resources and role obligations. The results will be an important complement to the existing studies of gender roles and sexuality which tend to focus on women's behavior, and should be of interest for public health specialists interested in designing effective programs to prevent STDs.                                                      ?\u2510\u255d ,>?\u2534%\u00c1\u2524\u00c0\u00c1 ?\u00c2 \u00a5\u00a9\u2563\u00a2 \u2563_\u2551?\u255d\u00a5/>\u00a5 \u255d\u00c1\u00c0\u2563?> ?\u00c2 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1 \u2534?\u255d%\u2524",
