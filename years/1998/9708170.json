 "awd_abstract_narration": "9708170  Rauber        The proposed research relates to the organization and evolution of phenomena  associated with mid-latitude cyclones and their influence on clouds, precipitation and  other meteorological elements.  Specifically, research will focus on three  phenomena: mesoscale gravity waves, lee cyclones, and mesoscale precipitation  bands.        The high spatial and temporal resolution data sets obtained during the  Stormscale Operations and Research Meteorology-Fronts Experiment, Systems Test  (STORM-FEST) provides the Principal Investigators with a unique opportunity to  further understanding of mesoscale gravity waves.  It is suspected that these gravity  waves are sometime associated with locally heavy snowfalls.  Analyses of  observations and ongoing numerical modeling studies will enable the investigation of  the mechanisms that generated and maintained a well-defined mesoscale gravity  wave that occurred on 14-15 February 1992, as well as the interaction between the  wave and the convection.        Analyses by the Principal Investigators of observations for four  STORM-FEST cyclone cases have raised important questions concerning the  variability in the pre-storm low level environment and its influence on the structure  and evolution of fronts, embedded precipitation and associated mesoscale phenomena  within lee cyclones. Understanding the influence of pre-storm environmental  conditions on the formation and subsequent structure and evolution of lee cyclones  is critical toward developing a comprehensive model of mid-latitude cyclones.  The  focus of the proposed research is to investigate the mechanisms behind the  variability of the structure and evolution of upper-level precursor disturbances,  surface and upper level fronts, lee cyclones, and mesoscale precipitation bands.        Research on heavy snowbands will be conducted in association with the  Lake-Induced Convection Experiment  (Lake-ICE) scheduled in the Great Lakes  region in the winter of 1997-98.  The Lake-ICE  is a large, multi-investigator project  that is designed to further understanding of the impact of the Great Lakes on  different weather phenomenon.  The research activities of the Principal Investigators  within Lake-ICE will consist of detailed observational and modeling studies of the  evolution of winter cyclones and embedded mesoscale processes as the cyclones  interact with the Lakes.          Successful completion of this research will lead to better conceptual models  of wintertime weather and could eventually lead to better forecasts.  ***",
