 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fiekers  9729535    Lactation is a physiological process which occurs in mammalian females in preparation for nourishing their young.  Significant changes occur in the female anterior pituitary gland in preparation for lactation.  The cells in this gland direct and regulate the activity of the cells and tissues involved in the production and expression of milk by the mother.  Lactotrophs are one of the cell types in the pituitary gland and these cells synthesize and secrete prolactin, a hormone largely responsible for the development of the female organs in preparation for lactation.  Very little is understood about the changes which occur in these cells during lactation.  It is known, however, that secretory cells require an elevation of cytosolic calcium for secretion and that action potentials are important for providing the increases in cytosolic calcium required for stimulus-response coupling in neuroendocrine cells.  Dr. Fiekers is interested in determining the cellular mechanisms by which lactotrophs response to external stimuli.  He has developed an acute pituitary slice preparation which allows him to examine these neuroendocrine cells with their cell to cell associations intact and, in many cases, with the cells polarized to secrete into adjacent blood vessels.  Thus, Dr. Fiekers can study individual cells in their normal configuration within the gland thus retaining the cell to cell contacts and communication which occur between neighboring cells.  Using state-of-the-art patch clamp techniques combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy, he will examine the basic properties of stimulus-response coupling in single lactotrophs.  Dr. Fiekers will define the properties of the lactotrophs prior to and during lactation in female rats to better understand the nature of the fundamental changes which occur during this physiological process.  The results of this proposal will provide significant new information on the fundamental steps in the release of the hormone prolactin during lactati on.  In addition, he will be able to measure alterations in the structure of the anterior pituitary gland with respect to size, distribution and arrangement of lactotrophs in the gland which occur as a result of lactation.  These potential changes represent a transformation of the organization within the gland which occurs during the physiological state and may provide the basis for our future understanding of changes in cell structure and function which occur, for example, in pregnancy, cancer, and senescence.",
