 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726766  Brown    This award supports a three year collaborative research  project between Professor Larry Brown of Cornell University  and Professor Naoshi Hirata of the University of Tokyo in  Japan.  The researchers will be undertaking a study of the  structure, seismicity and tectonics of the Japanese island  arc from new deep seismic exploration.   Japanese scientists  are developing a program for the systematic exploration of  the Japanese islands by deep seismic surveys on land to be  combined with comparable efforts by marine groups offshore.  They are developing a new deep seismic reflection/refraction  transect.  The transect will attempt to delineate the deep  geometry of major active, intra-arc faults at depth in an  area where the current tectonic boundary conditions are  relatively simple.   These geometries are a critical missing  element in understanding strain partitioning within the  crust and the dependent dynamic models of earthquake  tectonics.  The  researchers will focus on optimal design  and execution of deep seismic surveys, coupled with an  integrated, global approach to interpreting the results of  those surveys.     This project brings together the efforts of two  laboratories that have complementary expertise and research  capabilities.  The Cornell group will provide expertise in  the application of reflection seismic methods to a wide  variety of lithospheric imaging problems while the Japanese  researchers will provide expertise in fault tectonics and  earthquake mechanisms. The geologic targets of deep seismic  profiling in Japan are of scientific interest in their own  area.  However, these results are also likely to have much  broader implications for researchers in other areas, both in  terms of technique development and geological models of  continental evolution and active tectonics.  Younger  scientists will also be participating in this project.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project  will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promo te  international understanding and cooperation.  ***",
