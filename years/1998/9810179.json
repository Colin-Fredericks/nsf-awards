The URC brings together economists from across the country for two days of discussions on a particular topic. These conferences have been very successful in opening the lines of communication and establishing working relationships between economists who work within a particular field but are located at universities across the country. Continued support of the URC by the National Science Foundation would help to ensure that this valuable forum will continue.  Conference topics are chosen for their relevance to current economic policy discussions as well as their interest to academic economists. Recent conferences have focused on the effects of large government budget deficits on exchange rates and international capital flows, the role of firms in labor markets, taxation and financial behavior.  Papers for presentation at the conferences are solicited from over 125 economics departments and business schools. Conference organizers select a mix of established and less well known researchers. Discussants and other conference participants are also chosen to encourage interaction among researchers with similar interests at different universities. A typical conference includes 7 to 10 papers and about 80 participants from over 40 different universities.                                i",
