 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Squires will focus his research on the characterization of   carbene and carbyne intermediates.   Flowing afterglow ion beam studies   focusing on the spectral and chemical characterization of these reactive   intermediates will be augmented by theoretical studies correlating   structure-property relationships.    New methods for the preparation of   unusual carbene and carbyne intermediates will be developed, as well as a   new flowing afterglow apparatus that will provide higher resolution data.     Educational activities include training postdoctoral and graduate   students in the synthesis of reactive intermediates, and flowing   afterglow techniques.     With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports the research and educational activities of Professor Robert   Squires of the Department of Chemistry at Purdue University.   Professor   Squires' research focuses on the synthesis and characterization of   reactive, electron-deficient organic intermediates.    These species,   referred to as carbenes or carbynes depending on the extent of the   electron deficiency,  are of fundamental interest because they are   thought to be involved in bioorganic chemistry, drug design, material   science, and combustion and interstellar chemistry.   Professor Squires'   educational activities include the training of graduate and postdoctoral   students in chemical synthesis of reactive intermediates, and instrument   design and construction.",
