 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major challenge facing designers for digital signal processing (DSP) systems  is the rapidly increasing complexity of deriving sufficiently efficient and  predictable software implementations.  In consumer-oriented application domains  such as wireless communications and PC multimedia, extremely competitive time-to-  market pressure together with the continually escalating complexity of  applications and processor architectures require companies to sustain enormous  human resource expenditures for software development.  Similarly, in very high  performance applications such as radar signal processing, it remains a  significant challenge to partition programs and manage interprocessor  communication in a manner that effectively exploits large-scale multiprocessor  computer systems.  Over the past several years, it has become widely recognized  that dataflow is an attractive programming model for computer-aided DSP system  design tools.  This project is investigating algorithms that automatically or  interactively map high-level, dataflow programs for DSP into efficient software  implementations.    Specifically, this research is exploring (1) a thorough integration of dataflow  programming and imperative programming formats, and an efficient integration of  techniques for compiling dataflow with the existing techniques for compiling  imperative languages; (2) the development of automatic and interactive software  tools for mapping dataflow models into implementations on multiprocessor  architectures, with emphasis on efficiently managing the interactions between  scheduling, interprocessor communication, and synchronization; and (3) the  development of algorithms for compiling dataflow computations models into  uniprocessor implementations in such a way that program and data memory  requirements, invocation overhead of individual subprograms, and latency are  optimized.",
