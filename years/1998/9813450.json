Previous  exploratory work in the Strait identified several sites where hot  hydrothermal fluids emanate from the sea floor.  These  discoveries were made using an instrument package specially  designed to detect and map the thermal and chemical anomalies  that hydrothermal activity imparts on the overlying water column.  Hydrothermal sites in the Strait range in water depth from <200  to 1300 meters and occur on the volcanic outcrops that  periodically protrude through the sediment cover along the strike  of the rift zone.  These sites are alligned with the caldera at  Deception Island which has active hot springs.  These are the  first submarine hydrothermal sites discovered in Antarctica and  as such represent unique research opportunities.  This project  will return to the Strait to further map and sample these areas.    There are several compelling reasons to believe that further  exploration of vent systems in the Bransfield will yield exciting  new information: (1) Bransfield Strait is a back-arc rift system  and it is likely that the vent fluids and mineral deposits  associated with venting in this setting are unlike anything  sampled so far from submarine vents.  (2) Preliminary evidence  suggests that venting in the Bransfield occurs in two different  volcanic substrates: andesite and rhyolite.  This situation  provides a natural laboratory for investigating the effects of  substrate chemistry on vent fluid composition.  (3) Bransfield  Strait is isolated from the system of mid-ocean ridges and has a  relatively short history of rifting (approximately 4 my).  So,  while the region straddles the Atlantic and Pacific, vent biota  in the Strait may well have a distinct genealogy.  Biochemical  information on vent species in the Bransfield  will add to our  knowledge of the dispersal of life in the deep ocean.  In the  past such discoveries have led to the identification of new  species and the isolation of previously unknown biochemical  compounds. (4) The fire and ice environments of hydrothermal  sites in the Bransfield may prove to be the closest analog for  primordial environments on Earth and extraterrestrial bodies.    The Bransfield Strait is one of the most productive areas of the  world's oceans and lies close to the Antarctic continent, far  removed from the mid-ocean ridge system.  The combination of  organic-rich sediment and heat produced by volcanism in this back-  arc setting creates a situation conducive to unusual fluids,  unique vent biota, and exotic hydrothermal deposits.
