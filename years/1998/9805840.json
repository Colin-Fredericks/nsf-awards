 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on examining the role of the interactions between   alkali metal cations being transported through synthetic ion channels,   and the arene functionalities that make up the ion channel.   Synthetic   channels composed of diaza-18-crown-6 subunits connected by spacers of   various lengths will be synthesized to define the minimum length needed   to function as an ion channel.  Different arenes will be attached to the   channel opening, and by synthetic modification of the spacers,    incorporated into the channel interiors to elucidate the effect of   arene-cation interactions on sodium and potassium ion transport within   the channel.   Graduate and undergraduates students involved in the   research will be introduced to modeling an important, natural process by   means of model compounds and synthetically tailoring these compounds to   examine specific interactions involved in the process.     With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports the research and educational activities of Dr. George Gokel of   the Department of Molecular Biology and Pharmacology at the Washington   University School of Medicine.  Dr Gokel will focus his research on the   synthesis of macromolecular systems composed of  a number of equivalent   cyclic subunits connected by molecular spacers that, in toto, are   referred to as ion channels.   These molecular systems, which mimic   naturally occuring biological systems, will be synthetically modified to   explore a specific interaction that affects the movement of sodium and   potassium ions through the channel.   Dr. Gokel's educational activities   will involve training graduate and undergraduate students in the   syntheses of these model systems, and their characterization as ion   conductors.",
