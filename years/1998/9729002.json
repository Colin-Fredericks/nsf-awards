 "awd_abstract_narration": "Emotional expression in language shows great variation  crosslinguistically; how and to what extent are questions central  to linguistic and cognitive anthropology. Preliminary research on  written materials indicates that emotions which we English  speakers would call 'love' can be subdivided in Japanese into two  native categories, koi and ai. Japanese also has different  grammatical characteristics of emotional expression, the  discursive rules for which are not yet thoroughly understood for  two of three descriptive word classes. Furthermore, many  anthropological and popular sources describe a preference for  nonexpression or underexpression of emotion as a Japanese  cultural ideal. The interaction of these semantic, grammatical,  and cultural phenomena has never been examined. There are,  however, sites in Japanese culture where emotional expression is  valued and expected, which would allow data collection through  interview and participant observation.       Enka is an overtly emotionally expressive, indigenous  Japanese musical genre whose lyrics often focus on love and its  loss, and nostalgia for one's hometown, similar in some respects  to American country music. Enka music will provide a culturally  appropriate frame, not only yielding data for analysis through  examining its lyrics but also as a basis for elicitation of  discourse about emotions by native speakers. This project will  analyze both grammatical and semantic aspects of conversational  Japanese and the poetic lyrics of enka music to describe the  linguistic and cultural phenomena characteristic of emotional  expression in Japanese, with specific attention to potential  discursive evidence for categories of koi and ai.",
