 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810022  A series of two planning workshops are supported with the goals  of establishing the state of the art in the three scientific  communities of Computer Security, Fault Tolerance, and Software  Assurance and to set the course for future research. The  meetings, July 7-9, 1998 in York, UK and November 11-13, 1998 in  the USA, focus on the practical needs of system development,  where security, fault tolerance, and assurance requirements are  increasing dramatically with the rapid spread of commercial  enterprises into cyberspace. The workshops are designed to  promote a true dialogue between the communities, as well as  foster collaborations between researchers in the USA and abroad.  The motivating idea for the workshops is that these three  communities face many closely related problems, and consequently  solutions from one community are likely to be relevant in all  communities. Participants are asked to elaborate the fundamental  challenges facing their community, map these challenges to  related problems in the companion communities, and identify  promising solution paths. A book is planned to capture the  results of the workshop, including papers and supplementary  reports from the meetings.  ***",
