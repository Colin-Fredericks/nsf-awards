The researchers will undertake a study of complexity theory for  strategic goals.  The main objective is the development of more  refined tools for analyzing the complexity of computations than  are currently most commonly employed in the field.  Particular  areas to be investigated include:  (1) linear and quasi-linear  time reductions between problems, (2) low-level circuit-based  classes and reductions, often with quasi-linear bounds on circuit  size, (3) average-case complexity, including a determination of  which of  several competing polynomial-time formalisms is best  suited for lower time bound analysis, and (4) a new theory of one-  way functions that realize certain concrete polynomial complexity  gaps, such as being quasilinear-time computable but not  inevitable in less than quadratic time.     This project brings together the efforts of scientists, in both  countries, that have complementary expertise and research  capabilities. The development of a more acute analysis of  computational costs should help gauge its practical effectiveness  now, and its strategic potential as a guide for future  investigations.  Extending theories of (quasi-)linear time and of  low-level classes and reductions should provide a precise  understanding of what facets of problems make them hard  to solve  and how these facets are related between problems.  It is further  expected that it will be possible to understand the relationship  between average-case complexity and the nature-and-distribution  of such hard instances.  Through the exchange of ideas and  technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge  and promote international understanding and cooperation.  ***",
