 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to introduce the exciting modern techniques of biology and  chemistry to a non-science major student population. This group of students includes future health care workers and science teachers. The roles of these professions are changing as allied health paraprofessionals are asked to assume more responsibility for care giving and science teachers are held accountable for the science literacy of the nation. If we expect these students to meet these challenges, educators must look to providing high quality preparation. At Kent State University, East Liverpool Campus, we are changing to meet these new demands. The introduction of a strong core curriculum in the sciences for all of these students is in progress. We expect to provide experiences that, at most institutions, are reserved only for science majors. This proposal addresses the need for high quality instrumentation in laboratories to be used by these student populations. It takes an interdisciplinary approach melding biology and chemistry to enhance student understanding of fundamental levels of the organization of life, the cell and the molecule. In support of this goal, we require that further instrumentation be acquired. This proposal describes the need for fluorescent microscopy equipment with imaging capabilities, a medium pressure chromatography/gel filtration apparatus, and high performance liquid chromatography with mass analysis capabilities. Planned uses of this instrumentation to improve the science experience for allied health and education majors as well as science majors will focus on student laboratories. The laboratory activities will meet three criteria. First, they will reinforce lecture topics with direct experience. Second, their exploratory nature will promote critical thinking and encourage students to teach each other in a collaborative manner. Third, they will allow students to perform real experiments with the techniques of modern science laboratories. By following this plan, we expect t o dramatically enhance the undergraduate science experience at our campus.",
