 "awd_abstract_narration": "The herbarium of the National Tropical Botanical Garden  holds a large and taxonomically diverse collection of  Hawaiian and Pacific island plants, including the most  significant recent collection of plants from Kauai and other  major islands. Cabinets housing this collection of  approximately 35,000 specimens have become seriously  overcrowded, making the specimens difficult to access and  subject to physical damage.  This project will support the  purchase of eight full-height and twenty-three half-height  herbarium cabinets to accommodate present holdings and allow  for modest growth of the collection.  The additional  cabinets will accommodate newly mounted specimens,  substantially increase user accessibility, and reduce risk  of damage to the collections. It will also support the  mounting of the backlog of approximately 4,000 specimens  stored outside of cabinets in order to make them accessible  for research and loan purposes.  The resulting upgraded  storage and archival facilities will greatly facilitate and  improve research use and long-term management of this  important collection.",
