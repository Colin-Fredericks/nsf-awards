Mathematically, these systems represent dynamical \r\nsystems with many degrees of freedom. The PI will focus on waves in \r\ntwo-dimensional systems with axial anisotropy. The immediate motivation \r\nis given by recent experiments by G. Ahlers et al. on electroconvection in \r\nnematic liquid crystals, where three interesting regimes have been \r\nobserved: 1) extended waves exhibiting spatio-temporally chaotic \r\ndynamics, 2) waves localized into narrow, long patches (`worms'), and 3) \r\ntemporally irregular, spatially localized bursting of the wave amplitude. \r\nThese phenomena are found immediately above onset at small amplitudes \r\nof the waves. They therefore afford an excellent opportunity to develop \r\nand test mathematical ideas that will be relevant quite generally in weakly \r\nnonlinear theories of dissipative structures. Furthermore, due to the \r\nanisotropy this two-dimensional system can be described systematically \r\nby Ginzburg-Landau-type equations. No recourse to phenomenological \r\nequations of the Swift-Hohenberg-type is needed. The main part of the \r\nproject is devoted to the worms. They cannot be described by the \r\nGinzburg-Landau equations derived by straightforward asymptotic \r\nanalysis. The analysis has to be extended to include certain additional \r\nmodes that are strictly speaking not on the center manifold but become \r\nrelevant already very close to threshold. The main questions to be \r\naddressed are: the localization mechanism of the worms and suitable one-\r\ndimensional reductions (standing- and traveling-wave pulses), the stability \r\nof long worms, and the nucleation of worms from small noise. The project \r\nwill demonstrate how in cases like the one described here the qualitative \r\nand quantitative relevance of the weakly nonlinear theory can be \r\ndrastically increased by including a single additional mode. This aspect \r\ncarries over to a wide range of other systems. On a more specific level, the \r\nadvection of a slow mode will be important in other wave systems as well. \r\nAt the same time, for the electroconvection system detailed qualitative and \r\nquantitative comparisons with ongoing experiments will be achieved \r\nthrough close cooperation with the experimentalists.\r\n\r\nIn wide range of systems spatial structures appear spontaneously. These \r\npatterns can be time-independent or may have the form of traveling or \r\nstanding waves. Just a few examples are animal coat markings, waves on \r\nthe surface of vibrated fluids, cloud streets, waves in chemical reactions \r\nand in nerve conduction. If the properties of a system are the same over its \r\nwhole extent one would usually expect that the patterns also cover the \r\nwhole system. However, in quite a number of cases a spontaneous \r\nlocalization of the pattern in patches or even single wave crests has been \r\nobserved. In repeated runs of the same experiment the patches occur in \r\nrandomly varying locations. This indicates that their localization is not due \r\nto special properties of the system at that location. Such localized waves \r\nhave been observed, e.g., in vibrated granular material, fluid convection in \r\nmixtures, and in nematic liquid crystals. The funded research will \r\ncontribute to the understanding of the causes that lead to localization \r\nfocussing on the `worms' observed in liquid crystals. It will elucidate the \r\nmechanism in detail and investigate the chaotic bursting of such structures \r\nand how they are generated (nucleated) from weak noise that is due to the \r\nthermal motion in the fluid. Using advanced mathematical methods, the \r\nresearch will bring out the central features that are relevant more generally \r\nin other systems as well.\r\n",
