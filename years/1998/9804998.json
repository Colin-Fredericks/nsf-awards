 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer mediated communications are a new and rapidly growing phenomena made available by the new information technology of networked computers.  This project involves a cultural anthropologist studying web sites of American Indian societies.  The project will investigate who is using the technology in a sample of American Indians societies active on the world wide web, how the information is presented and what ramifications the use has for the local Indian culture.  The investigator will visit between four and six locations to interview persons involved in designing and maintaining the web pages, and will survey web pages of American Indians societies, analyzing the information presented as it reflects native American Indian identity and the new technology.  The goal will be to discover the various constituencies and positions within the community, including innovators, resisters, adapters, as well as the alienated sectors of the society.  The project will focus on the influence on Native culture of the new technology as well as of the influence on the technology of the local culture.  This project will advance our understanding of the impact of new information technology on this most traditional sector of American society, and should provide valuable knowledge about how the new technology may be redesigned to facilitate and support local community traditions.",
