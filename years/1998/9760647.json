 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9760647  Clark    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will involve development of a micromachined-accelerometer based Micro-Sensor Module for use in seismic testing and infrastructure monitoring applications ranging from earthquake studies to active structure control.  The heart of the module will be a triad of miniature, inexpensive, low-power accelerometers.  Built-in serial bus and wireless communication capability will be included.  Integrated Micro Instruments was formed from the core DARPA-sponsored Berkeley Sensor & Actuator Center (BSAC) design team which produced some of the first integrated microaccelerometers.  This work has resulted in a medium performance micro-sensor module with signal processing on a thumbnail sized silicon chip.  These proven sensor architectures will be combined with a deep trench micromachining technology developed at BSAC.  The extremely thick structures will dramatically increase sensitivity and hence improve performance.  Integrating circuits with these sensors will allow temperature compensation, filtering, exceptional miniaturization, and digital output.  The goal of Phase I is to prove that micromachining can produce sensors and sensor systems with the performance required for seismic and infrastructure monitoring.  Complete mechanical sensor and electrical circuit design will verify feasibility and allow rapid fabrication of functional devices in Phase II.    Market research firms forecast inexpensive, micromachined inertial sensors to command a market of over one billion dollars with unit sales in the tens of millions by the year 2000.  High volume commercial applications such as automotive safety, virtual reality, 3-D computer mice, and machine monitoring already incorporate miniature sensors which can be vastly improved using this technology.  The high performance micro-sensors envisioned open new frontiers such as augmented GPS navigation, general aviation, robotics, and platform leveling.  Integrated Micro Instruments has be en approached by venture capitalists and a military contractor continuing the very high level of commercial interest.  ***",
