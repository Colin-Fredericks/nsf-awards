 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental property of most visual systems is directional  sensitivity, in which objects moving one direction are quickly  discriminated from objects moving in an opposite direction.  The  cellular mechanisms for this property are largely unknown.  This  collaborative research project brings together the skills of a  physiologist and an ultrastructural anatomist in a  multidisciplinary approach involving electrophysiology,  biochemistry, computational neuroscience and electron microscopy.  Using the well-studied visual system of crayfish as a model, this  project tests a novel hypothesis that the same excitable membrane  channel can integrate excitatory and inhibitory effects of two  different neurotransmitter compounds.  The technical difficulties  give the project a high level of risk, but the potentially very  high impact of the results, along with the experience  and skills  of the PIs, make taking the risk worthwhile.     Results will be important beyond simply invertebrate vision, to  understanding a fundamental property of visual systems, and to  clarifying a cellular mechanism of integration important to all  neuroscience as well as to cell physiology.",
