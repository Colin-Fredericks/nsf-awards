 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803659  Nelson    This grant provides 50% salary support over two years for  technical support in the Isotope Geochemistry Laboratory in the  Dept. of Geological Sciences, University of Washington.  This  grant represents Phase II of technician support which follows on  three years support provided by Phase I (EAR-9417870). The  isotope geochemistry technician, G. Hinn, now has eight years of  experience in solid-source mass spectrometry, chemical  separations, acid distillation, and electrical and mechanical  maintenance critical to operation of the laboratory. He is  experienced in the anlayses of U-Pb, Sm-Nd, Rb-Sr isotope  systems, and has assisted in development of high-precision trace  element analyses of Ca, Mg, K, V, U and Ba in minerals and  natural waters. A critical aspect of the technician's duties is  to monitor on a daily basis operation and adherence to protocol  by workers in the clean labs. He also participates in the  education of students and visiting researchers. For example,  during Phase I support, he taught and was a constant resource for  six undergraduate students who have been involved in research,  six graduate students and two post-doctoral researchers. Research  supported by the technical support grant spans a large range of  subjects but much of it follows four main scientific themes;  ocean island volcanism, tectonics and magmatism at continental  margins, modern and paleo-chemical fluxes in the oceans, and  migration of metals in the environment. As in the past, through  extensive collaborative work this grant will support the Isotope  Geochemistry Lab as a resource for students and colleagues not  only in Geological Sciences, but also in Departments of  Oceanography, Chemistry and Geophysics, and for colleagues at  other universities and colleges in the northwest.  ***",
