This project will develop two Design- Complex courseware that will be accessible on the World Wide Web:  DesignComplex on Wearable Computers and DesignComplex on Building Design.  A \"complex\" is an interconnected assemblage of related things.  The DesignComplexes will share an underlying collaborative web-based learning environment for design problem solving.  The DesignComplexes will include web-based open-ended multidisciplinary design projects, design and analysis tools, communication and information structuring tools for student design teams and faculty, instructional material for faculty to guide them in the use of the courseware, and a variety of evaluation methods to be used by students, faculty, and developers.  Each DesignComplexes will have different modules appropriate for first year students through graduate students.  At successive levels, simplifying assumptions can be removed and factors such as business or ethical concerns may be added.  The project plan includes the development, testing, evaluation, and dissemination of the DesignComplexes.",
