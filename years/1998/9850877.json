 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hope College has recently developed an environmental science minor. Now in its second year, the new minor program has experienced a tripling of the total number of students (from 8 to 24).  This positive sign supports our decision to provide for an expanded capability to perform analytical testing of field samples and to develop a means to organize, analyze, archive, and disseminate the environmental data collected by students.    Acquisition of a FTIR spectrometer allows students in early stages of the environmental science minor to learn about pollutants in air and water by, for example, conducting experiments on the effectiveness of exhaust emission controls on carbon-based gases. A UV-Vis spectrophotometer adds the ability to evaluate emissions of nitrous oxides in a companion comparison, so that students can explore and understand factors involved in air pollution.     Both instruments have the capability to analyze a wide array of other environmentally important chemicals at naturally occurring background concentrations. This enables students in the capstone course for the minor, the Advanced Environmental Seminar, to pursue independent research projects on the impact of humans on the local watershed. These research projects are designed and executed by the students, who work in interdisciplinary teams.    A new student computer facility with Geographic Information System (GIS) capabilities gives students the means to organize and analyze the data they gather in combination with data from previous classes and local and state environmental agencies. The GIS system also facilitates sharing raw data and analyses with collaborators from the Macatawa Area Coordinating Council, a metropolitan planning organization, local decision makers, and the public.",
