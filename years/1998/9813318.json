 "awd_abstract_narration": "Garton  9813318  Antarctic coastal environments have been the site of recent  studies on the effects of human activities on marine  ecosystems. This international, collaborative study will  focus on developing methodologies to generate biological  baselines for the benthic nearshore habitat in the Ross Sea  region of Antarctica. These baselines will be useful to for  studies to distinguish between natural environmental  variability from anthropogenic impacts and to assess the  recovery capacity of coastal marine populations which have  been exposed to natural and anthropogenic stresses. The  study will take place in Terra Nova Bay and will be  conducted in cooperation with the Italian Antarctic Program.  The research will focus on populations of the scallop  Adamussium colbecki from a natural-impact site (meltwater  stream), anthropogenic-impact site (in the vicinity of the  Terra Nova Bay Station in Tethys Bay) and control site (no  meltwater stream in a pristine area of Tethys Bay). Diver-  assisted collection and remotely operated vehicle photo-  surveys will provide data to determine bivalve size  frequencies and densities along with benthic community  patterns across depth and distance gradients from the  shoreline at each site. Environmental gradients will also be  measured. Bivalve physiology profiles will be generated by  micro-respirometry measurements of oxygen consumption rates  as well as nitrogen excretion rates under ambient and  temperature-stressed environmental conditions. Biochemical  assays will be used to assess metabolic activity. The  physiological and biochemical assays will be complemented by  cellular biomarker analysis performed by the Italian  collaborators. Integration of these biochemical,  physiological and population assays will provide examples of  biological baselines for assessing indicator species'  responses to natural and anthropogenic impacts in the  Antarctic coastal zone.",
