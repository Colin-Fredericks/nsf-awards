 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some simple single-celled organisms provide models for  understanding complex biological problems.  In sensory  neuroscience, one of the areas important to understand is the  process of transduction, in which capture of some form of stimulus  is transformed into a cellular signal of some kind.  In  chemosensory transduction, for example smell, an odor molecule  binds with a particular receptor protein on the membrane of the  olfactory sensory cell, and internal biochemical reactions lead to  the sending of a nerve impulse to the brain.  This project  continues work on the common bacterium E. coli, as a model system  for chemoreception.  This unicellular organism lives in liquid  medium, and propels itself toward attractant chemicals like  nutrients, and away from others.  It has been found that the  mechanism for this chemically-cued movement, called chemotaxis,  depends in part on the role of calcium ions in solution.  Calcium  ions are known to be extremely important in other cellular  signaling systems, including between nerve cells.  This project  combines biochemical work with genetic mutant strains of bacteria  to test steps in the chemotactic response for calcium sensitivity,  to find out how changes in local calcium concentration affect the  chemotaxis, and to see whether pharmacological agents that block  calcium responses in other systems work the same way in bacteria.     Results are important beyond simply bacterial chemotaxis  because they are highly relevant to understanding sensory  transduction in general, and to understanding how calcium can  exert important and widespread effects in more complex systems.",
