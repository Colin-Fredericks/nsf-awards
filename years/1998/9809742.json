 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Prof. John J. Boland at the University of North Carolina at   Chapel Hill is supported by the Advanced Materials and Processing Program   in the Chemistry Division and the Electronic Materials Program in the   Division of Materials Research. The focus of the research is charge   transport in molecular wires and devices. The methodology by which charge   transport will be directly measured in large molecules, oligomers,   conducting polymers and segments of conducting polymers will utilize the   dual probe scanning tunneling microscope (DPSTM), a unique instrument   developed by the principal investigator. For molecules whose dimensions   are less that the minimum interprobe spacing, contact leads will be   fabricated onto the molecules. The research will address which structures   favor and which impede charge flow, where potential drops occur within   molecules and their relationship to molecular structure, energy   dissipation in molecules during charge transport and the effect of charge   transfer at the probe-molecule interface.   The ultimate limit in circuit size minimization is the development of   devices with molecular dimensions, i.e., molecular electronics. This   investigation will address the fundamental principles behind the   transport of charge in molecules and relate electronic properties to   molecular structure.",
