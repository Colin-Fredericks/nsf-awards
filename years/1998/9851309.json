 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has five components:    It will coordinate the development of mathematics concepts in college algebra and calculus courses with the schedule of laboratory experiments and theoretical components in chemistry, physics, and biology courses so that students are more likely to understand the interdisciplinary connections.    It will provide data-collection & data-analysis stations near the chemistry, physics, and biology laboratories so that students can perform more experiments in these courses; this equipment will be compatible with computing equipment in a math-science classroom computer lab to facilitate coordination between the mathematics and science courses.    It will establish a math-science classroom computer lab reserved exclusively for targeted mathematics and science courses to give students in these courses better access to computing facilities.    It will develop a course, \"Applied Mathematics in the Natural Sciences,\" which will be both cross-listed with other departments (Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, Physics) and team-taught by faculty from the Mathematics, Chemistry, and Biology Departments. This sophomore-level course will give students experience in designing and conducting an experiment, collecting data, doing appropriate mathematical analysis of their data, then re-designing and  up-dating the experiment based on initial results, and finally drawing conclusions. We will explore the possibility of publishing the lab manual for this new course, and disseminating it to a national audience.      This project will form the basis for developing a Minor in \"Mathematics for Science Majors,\" to encourage Chemistry and Biology majors to strengthen their mathematical preparation by taking additional mathematics courses.    As a result of this project, we expect that both science and mathematics majors will have a deeper understanding of the connections between mathematics and the natural sciences. Science majors will learn to use mathematics as an important tool in their s cientific investigations and, because of this, will take additional courses in mathematics.  We also expect the number of majors graduating in Chemistry, Biology, and/or Mathematics to increase because we have been able to retain more students who come to our University interested in these majors, and because we have attracted more undecided first-year students and non-majors to consider a major in one of these fields.",
