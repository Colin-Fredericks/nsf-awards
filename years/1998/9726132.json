 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, focusses on the use of a new method for probing the  structure and orientation of protein films formed on well  characterized surfaces.  Professor Saavedra and his colleagues at  the University of Arizona will use integrated optical waveguide-  attenuated total reflection and total internal refection  fluorescence techniques to characterize heme protein films prepared  on Langmuir-Blodgett films and self-assembled polyion films.  The  focus will be to develop correlations between heme protein  orientation, functional properties, and direct electron reactions.   Long-term objectives of this work involve use of these protein  films in molecular device technologies such as bioanalytical  sensing, energy storage/conversion, and bioseparations.    A new method using integrated optical waveguides has been developed  for studying the structure of heme proteins on surfaces.  Professor  Saavedra and his colleagues at the University of Arizona developed  this very sensitive method to characterize thin protein films  formed on well characterized surfaces.  These proteins form films  on these surfaces through controlled electrostatic interactions.   The properties of these thin protein films are projected to have  uses in areas such as bioanalytical sensing, energy  storage/conversion, and biospecific separations.  The development  of new molecular devices for applications in several biotechnology  areas is the long-term goal of this work.",
