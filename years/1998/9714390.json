 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of the Chemistry Division, the Atomic, Molecular, Optical, and Plasma   Physics Program of the Physics Division, and the Office of   Multidisciplinary Activities of the Directorate for Mathematical and   Physical Sciences, Chemla will use single-molecule spectroscopic   techniques as well as single- and multi-photon excitation to explore the   photophysical and photochemical properties of single molecules in aqueous   solution and close to metallic interfaces.  For single molecules under   water new immobilization schemes will be developed based on previous work   on dry surfaces.  The effect of the microscopic structure of surfaces on   chemical reactions close to those surfaces will be examined by way of the   fluorescence of the reporting molecules.  Scanning probe techniques will   be utilized to explore the interplay between the relative orientation of   a single dipole with respect to the surface and the elementary   excitations of the metal.  The effects of applied electric fields and   local field effects will be studied.    These studies are important for understanding the physical and chemical   processes involved in biologically important environments.  Such a   spectroscopic capability as will be developed here has a variety of   fundamental as well as practical applications, such as to the development   of improved chemical biosensors.  It also has relevance to understanding   the surface chemistry and physics of materials on a molecular level.",
