 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing  concern over the global spread of red tides produced  by  toxic  and non-toxic dinoflagellates has focused research interest on physical and  biological  interactions that influence the accumulation, persistence,  and  demise  of bloom-forming species. The harmful effects imposed by red  tides  on  marine  fauna  and  associated risks to public  health  and  commercial  fisheries  have  also  prompted interest in means to detect,  predict,  and  potentially  control harmful algal blooms. Recent studies have  shown  that  microparasites, including viruses, bacteria, and protozoa, are abundant  in  marine    environments.   Furthermore,   parasite-induced   mortality    of  bacterioplankton  and phytoplankton can cause population level  changes  in  host  abundance  on  time scales of hours to days.  Infection  of  red-tide  dinoflagellates  by their parasitic relative Amoebophrya ceratii  has  been  linked  to rapid declines in host populations. This parasite has also  been  implicated as an important factor in preventing bloom formation. while  all  such  infections of free-living dinoflagellates have been attributed  to  a  single  species  of  parasite, recent data suggest that  A.  ceratii  is  a  species  complex  composed  of  multiple  host-specific  parasites.    This  research  will further the understanding of red-tide ecology by considering  the  interplay  between  host specificity and parasitism  of  bloom-forming  dinoflagellates in Chesapeake Bay. It will also help define the  complexity  of host-parasite interactions in planktonic systems and provide new insight  on  the  role of parasitism in microbial food-web dynamics.  Five  specific  hypotheses   will  be  tested  using  state-of-the-art  morphological   and  molecular methods.",
