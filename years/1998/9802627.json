Organized by  Prof. Theodore Fleming of the University of Miami and Prof.  Alfonso Valiente-Banuet of the National Autonomous  University of Mexico (UNAM), the workshop will involve major  researchers studying columnar cacti and their mutualists in  the United States, Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia, and will  feature oral presentations, poster sessions, and formal and  informal discussions.    Columnar cacti often are the dominant and ecologically most  important plants over vast areas in arid regions of the  southwestern United States, Mexico, northern and Andean  South America, and the Caribbean.  These plants provide food  and shelter for many species of animals, including migratory  birds and bats of conservation concern.  Participants at the  workshop will present results of their research and  contribute to a book to be edited by the two organizers of  the workshop proceedings.  ***",
