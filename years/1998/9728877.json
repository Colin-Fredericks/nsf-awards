 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proper execution of organogenic processes, such as neurogenesis, requires the coordinated activities of various regulatory proteins during development. The pan-neural expressed protein Prospero (Pros) represents a predominately nuclear localized, atypical homeodomain protein, that is required for the proper expression of an array of other regulatory genes during the formation of the nervous system in Drosophila. As a consequence, loss of Prospero activity results in severe defects in the developing nervous system and death of the embryo during the late stages of embryogenesis. Previous work has shown that Prospero can function as a transcription factor, and the capacity of Pros to modulate the activities of several other homeodomain transcription factors. The present proposal is aimed towards the molecular genetic analysis of the structure/functional properties of the pros protein in its in vivo interactions with homeodomain proteins during neurogenesis. High degrees of evolutionary conservation have been observed for regulatory proteins, including Pros, between vertebrate and invertebrate systems. The analysis of the specific functional requirements and interactions in a model system such as Drosophila provides information that is of direct relevance for the understanding of the functional roles of corresponding vertebrate genes in normal development and pathological processes.",
