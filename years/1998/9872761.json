 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Internet is facing two problems simultaneously: we need a faster\r\nswitching/routing infrastructure, and we need to introduce guaranteed\r\nqualities of service (QoS). As a community, we have proposals for each: we\r\ncan make the routers faster by using input-queued crossbar switches,\r\ninstead of shared memory systems; and we can introduce QoS using WFQ-based\r\n(weighted fair queueing) packet scheduling. But we don't know how to do\r\nboth at the same time. Until now, the two solutions have been mutually\r\nexclusive - all of the work on WFQ-based scheduling algorithms has required\r\nthat switches/routers use output-queueing, or centralized shared memory.\r\n\r\nThe Fork-Join Router is designed to address both problems. The router is a\r\nvery high performance, scalable, fault-tolerant system designed to operate\r\nat multi-terabits per second, yet provide exact support for qualities of\r\nservice. The router is highly parallel, and is composed of multiple,\r\nidentical, independently operating planes. When they arrive, all of the\r\npackets belonging to the same flow are directed (forked) to the same plane\r\nof the router for processing. Prior to departure, the flows are remerged\r\n(joined) so\r\nas to maintain the QoS of each flow through the system.\r\n\r\nBefore a fork-join router can be built (as a prototype, or in industry as a\r\ncommercial product) some significant questions must be answered: How can\r\nthe fork, join and switch scheduling functions be implemented? Our work\r\nfocusses on answering these problems.\r\n\r\n",
