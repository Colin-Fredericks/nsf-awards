 "awd_abstract_narration": "HRD-9801773  Thomas    Designed to increase the aspirations of minority students, Enterprise 2002, as systemic initiative, guarantees a  strong mathematics and science foundation upon completion of high school.  Minority students graduating from  Beaumont Independent School District (BISD) will be prepared for university studies in science, mathematics,  engineering and technology (SMET) fields.  The project targets all BISD students, pre-kindergarten through twelfth  grade in thirty schools and assimilates all partners in contact with students:  principals, teachers, counselors,  business partners, community volunteers, parents, professionals, university experts in mathematics and science and  minority scholars.  The nucleus of Enterprise 2002 encompasses professional development, minority student  support, activities beyond the school day and standard based curriculum enhancements.  Professional development  incorporates innovative instructional strategies, such as cooperative learning, diversity awareness, inquiry learning,  problem based learning, and assessment, and recent research in changes in math and science.  Student support  includes tutorials involving community volunteers, business partners, guidance and career awareness seminars,  clergy in schools, and parental support groups.  Activities beyond the school day include:  summer programs,  Saturday Academies, and after school projects that are designed to increase awareness of careers in science,  engineering, mathematics and technology, and strengthen student performance.  The standards based curriculum and  classroom materials will be augmented with National Science and Technology Week Projects, Future Math and  Science Teacher Clubs, Create Southeast Texas, Math 24 Challenge Tournaments, Insights, Voyager, Science  Sleuths, Lego Dacta Math, Science, and technology programs, SAT and PSAT preparation courses, University  Interscholastic League (UIL) competitions, Future Problem Solving, Odyssey of the Mind, Young Astronauts,  Minor ities in Science, Family Math and Family Science.  We have also implemented a tuition free Educational  Enhancement Program for Non-Degree BISD personnel designed to recruit minority teachers in mathematics and  science from within the district.  In other words, we are growing our own mathematics and science teachers.  Since  significant partnerships have already been established with many local organizations (universities, businesses,  museums, industries community organizations), implementation of Enterprise 2002 will proceed at a rapid pace.   Enterprise 2002 complements the BISD Board of Trustee's primary goal of reducing rapid disparity in achievement  by channeling more minority students into advanced classes and ensuring that all students are better prepared to  enter the science, engineering, and mathematics pipeline after graduation.  This project is a systemic initiative driven  by high achievement standards for all state and local accountabilities.  An advisory council composed of all partners  will oversee the implementation of Enterprise 2002.  Evaluation of student achievement will be documented through  various data resources:  results of performance based and criterion referenced state and local assessments, course  grades, attitudinal surveys, student projects/portfolios, and pre-college courses successfully completed.  Beaumont  Independent School District is committed to Enterprise 2002 and will continue with the systemic reform in  mathematics and science even after the National Science Foundation (NSF) funding ceases and will present a plan  for sustaining the reform.    Goals:  o        To double the number of minority students enrolled in and successfully completing  science,           engineering, and mathematics pre-college courses.  o        To improve teacher expectations and diversify instructional methods through staff  development and           content proficiency in science, mathematics, engineering and technology    (SMET) pipeline courses.  o        To improve st udent achievement in mathematics and science education in grades Pre K-12.    Enterprise 2002 will receive priority in the Beaumont Independent School District (BISD) for it directly supports  the district goals.  See Section J, Appendix A, for the district mission and goals.",
