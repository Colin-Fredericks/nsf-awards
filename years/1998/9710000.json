 "awd_abstract_narration": "Education is widely seen as essential for economic growth in developing countries. Yet despite a large number of studies, there are significant gaps in our knowledge of the relative effectiveness of different education policies. In part, this is because it is difficult to separate out the effect of school inputs from unobserved variables which also affect education, and may be correlated with school inputs. This project will take advantage of randomized treatment to evaluate two policies that have been increasingly advocated by education specialists: promotion of Early Childhood Development (ECD) and provision of vouchers to allow students to attend private schools. Both topics are of interest not only to developing countries but also to developed countries.  The study of early childhood development will be conducted in cooperation with a Dutch nonprofit organization which provides educational assistance to Kenyan schools. The principal investigator taught secondary school in rural Kenya for one year, and is currently collaborating with the organization on a prospective, randomized study of primary education in rural Kenya. This study will be extended to examine 100 locally run preschools. Teachers in these preschools typically have no training beyond secondary school, and receive about $10 per month in salary financed by parent fees. Under this study, one half of the preschools will be randomly assigned to receive in-service training and salary supplements for teachers, while the other half will serve as a comparison group.  The study of vouchers will examine the Subsidios PACES program in Colombia. This program, which has been in operation since 1992, was designed to allow students from poor households to attend private secondary schools. Because there were not enough funds to provide all applicants with vouchers, the vouchers were allocated using a lottery. Outcomes between 1,500 lottery winners and 1,500 lottery losers will be compared.  The effect of both programs on educational outcomes will be examined, including enrollment, daily attendance, grade repetition, and scores on achievement tests. Further, the effects of the programs on household decision making and on school organization will be analyzed. Also, the project will examine whether the effects of the programs vary with students' sex, socio economic status, age, or current school performance  Each study also raises its own specific sets of questions. For the preschool study, the questions include the following: I ) Do untrained teachers change their method of child-care after receiving training? 2) Do absenteeism rates among teachers fall when they receive salary supplements? 3) Do parents increase or decrease their support of schools when salary supplements were provided to teachers? 4) Does improved pre primary education pay for itself by reducing grade repetition in primary school?  The study of the voucher program will examine questions such as: 1) How many of the students supported by vouchers in Colombia would have attended school in the absence of a voucher program? 2) How many would have attended private schools? 3) What is the impact of the program on educational attainment and cognitive achievement?",
