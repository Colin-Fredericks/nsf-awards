 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry  Program, focusses on the synthesis and characterization of novel  electroactive oligomers, linear polymers, and dendrimers.  Organic  materials that have new architectures will be designed and  synthesized in this project.  Professor Miller and his students at  the University of Minnesota will use spectroscopic, conductivity,  electrochemical, quartz crystal microbalance, impedance,  differential scanning calorimetry, x-ray diffraction, and  rheological measurements in this multidisciplinary work.  New  polymeric thin films will be prepared that are electroactive,  electrical conductive, and photoconducting or electroemissive.  The  responsiveness of these thin films to adsorbed vapors will be  characterized with the aim of developing new vapor sensors.    There are many potential applications for new organic materials  that are electrochemically active and that exhibit photoconduction.   Professor Miller and his students at the University of Minnesota  will prepare and characterize new compounds that are predicted to  have these properties.  A wide range of instrumental methods will  be used to determine the electrochemical and photochemical activity  of these new compounds.  One example of a potential use for these  new materials will be in preparing thin films that are sensitive to  chemical vapors.  New chemical sensors for vapors will be developed  for compounds that possess the requisite sensitivity to target  analytes.",
