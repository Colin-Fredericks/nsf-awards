One of these is dedicated to solid state research, which requires long wavelength spectral range coverage.  The synchrotron source possesses both power and brightness advantages (by factors of ~10 and ~1000, respectively) over conventional sources in this usually difficult spectral range.\r\nThis award supports the development of a comprehensive facility for infrared spectroscopy in magnetic fields up to 15T.  The basic elements of the instrumentation are a far-IR spectrometer and a superconducting magnet.  Two principal modes of operation are considered: \"traditional\" magnetotransport and magnetic modulation spectroscopy (MMS). Used as an IR magnetotransport device, the instrument will allow us to study small samples, where the brightness of the source is crucial.  In the MMS mode the facility will open up novel ways of studying conduction electron spin resonance (cESR) in metals and insulators, optically detected resonance in semiconducting quantum structures, and magnetic modulation spectroscopy in general.  The materials to be investigated include compounds of colossal magneto-resistance, high temperature superconductors, fullerenes, semiconductors and epitaxial semiconducting structures and other systems.\r\nThe instrumentation will meet the needs of a wide range of users wanting to explore optical properties of solids in magnetic fields.  User access will be managed in the framework of the NSLS user program, providing free beamtime for the projects approved in a scientific review process.\r\n%%%\r\n***\r\n",
