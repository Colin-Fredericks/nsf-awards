 "awd_abstract_narration": "9734103  Interactive steering permits users to monitor a program's  execution and adjust application parameters and resource  allocation in an online fashion. Steering tools must address  issues related to the consistency, lag, scalability, and induced  perturbation of monitoring, display, and interaction components.  However, the ideal balance among these concerns varies with  execution environment and target application. Thus,  configurability is an important issue. This research focuses on  the design and development of infrastructure for a steering  environment that permits users to specify the configuration to  provide the desired balance among consistency, lag, and  perturbation. This project includes the development of modular  algorithms for the collection of snapshots with varying degrees  of consistency, and algorithms that permit the consistent  application of changes to the executing program, while minimizing  resulting lag and perturbation. These algorithms for consistent  monitoring and steering build on existing work on snapshot  algorithms, and extend this work from the realm of consistent  observation of distributed systems to ensuring consistency in the  application of changes to an executing distributed computation,  through an innovative application of optimistic computing  techniques.  Another interesting feature of this work is the use  of monitoring and steering ``agents'', implemented as scripts,  and deployed in a modular, hierarchical monitoring and steering  environment.***",
