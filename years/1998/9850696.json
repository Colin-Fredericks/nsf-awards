Our target audience is the biology majors who plan to transfer to four-year institutions. Currently students in Bio lC conduct laboratory exercises in protein isolation, enzyme kinetics, and nucleic acid isolation and analysis. We plan to augment our laboratory curriculum with the inclusion of experiments using UV spectroscopy. Students will use this instrument in enzyme kinetics experiments, measurement of protein and nucleic acids and for analysis of absorption spectra of biological molecules. The acquisition of this instrument for the biology laboratory represents the next phase in our on-going goal of developing a teaching laboratory in biochemistry and molecular biology laboratory equipped with up-to-date equipment and instrumentation.",
