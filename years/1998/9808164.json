 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project explores the cultural, personality, and situational factors that help perpetuate violence against women among three groups. Specifically, it tries to examine the factors that give rise to violence among Latinos, northern Anglos, and southern Anglos within the United States. The project explores sets of interrelated themes that are hypothesized to contribute to domestic violence. These themes include: a) notions of male honor that make cuckoldry a matter of deep shame and support the man's use of violence against either his partner or male transgressors; b) traditional sex roles that legitimize a man's brutish behavior as `natural` and make it a woman's responsibility to curb such behavior; and c) romantic notions of love and jealousy that equate extreme jealousy with extreme love, creating an implicit formulation that violence = jealousy = love and therefore excusing violence that arises from such passions. These themes may be particularly strong in southern Anglo and Latino culture. They are not absent in northern Anglo culture either, and their manifestation here may be driven by individual differences and situational factors that are important to discover (from both a theoretical and practical perspective). Domestic violence is a major problem in this country and in cultures around the world, and this research project is intended to help us understand the cultural, personality, and social factors that contribute to this pervasive crime. Applications for knowledge gained in this research can include: a) identification of people and subpopulations at heightened risk for domestic violence; b) creation of more effective public health campaigns, which can target the most relevant messages to relevant audiences, and c) development of potential therapeutic techniques that are maximally culturally sensitive and effective for both male and female participants.",
