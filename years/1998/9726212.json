 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports Dr. Mark A. Linne and a graduate student from the Colorado School   of Mines in a collaboration with Katharina Kohse-H`inghaus of the Department of   Physical Chemistry at the University of Bielefeld.  The collaboration between the two   groups will investigate the use of novel picosecond laser sources and techniques to   evaluate and develop laser diagnostics for reacting gas-phase flows in processes such as   combustion, chemical vapor deposition, and plasmas.  The group in Bielefeld is well-  known for its research on the fundamental aspects of laser-induced fluorescence   diagnostics.  The Colorado group has a laboratory setup that complements the German   capabilities and has been used for the development of several non-traditional picosecond   laser techniques.  The main goals of the work are to study energy transfer in small   molecules, develop new picosecond diagnostics, combine the capabilities of the two   groups, and bring younger members of the group into the collaboration.",
