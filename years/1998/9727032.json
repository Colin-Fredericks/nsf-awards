 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727032  Housen    This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring a  superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) for the paleomagnetics  laboratory at Western Washington University.  The PI, Bernie  Housen is a recent addition to the Geology Department faculty at  Western Washington, having just completed a postdoctoral program  at the Institute for Rock Magnetism at the University of  Minnesota.  In addition to Housen, Professor emeritus Myrl Beck  and Russ Burmeister will utilize the SRM in their research.    The addition of an SRM at WWU will allow analyses of weakly  magnetized sediments for research aimed at understanding the  influences of oxidizing fluids and active deformation on the  magnetic properties of accretionary prism sediments and the  combined effects of chemical diagenesis and biological activity  on the magnetic records recorded in marine sediments both in  natural samples and in laboratory cultures.  This facility will  be unique to the Pacific Northwest region and will support  additional collaborative studies by researchers from nearby  institutions including the University of Washington, University  of Puget Sound, University of Idaho and the University of  Montana.  This SRM will be housed in a newly constructed field  free room and complement additional paleomagnetic instrumentation  that has recently been acquired (i.e. alternating field  demagnetizer, Kappa bridge).  Support for this grant is shared  between the Earth Sciences Instrumentation and Facilities Program  (EAR/IF) and Division of Ocean Sciences Oceanographic  Instrumentation and Technical Service Program (OCE/ITS) and the  Ocean Drilling Program (OCE/ODP)  ***",
