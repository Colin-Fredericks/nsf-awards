The method considers recycling tasks, collection, sortation and separation of materials and remanufacturing tasks such as material compounding and depolymerization.  Each task may have several different implementations and can be located at different sites connected by various modes of transportation. This results in a superstructure of recycling networks from which the one with lowest overall annualized cost will be found using an optimization method. The approach will be based on mixed integer linear programming methodology and will include an interface implemented on the World Wide Web to allow potential users of the tool to access and modify models to run case studies and examine solutions.\r\n     If successful, the results of this research will provide a way to design cost effective reverse production systems and improve the understanding of the similarities and differences in systems for recovering a range of products. The optimal solution will  consist of which sites to open, what tasks to allocate to the sites and how much material should be shipped by what mode. The formulation has a multi-period structure so that the network can be expanded in an optimal fashion over time. The method will be tested using several products starting with carpet for which a small scale network exists. Other products will include paper machine webs and electronic consumer goods. The tool will provide the capability of simulating a wide range of recycling and reprocessing strategies and technologies.  This will quantify the effects of uncertainty in collection volumes and technologies on the structure of the network for those trying to make investments in recycling infrastructure.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
