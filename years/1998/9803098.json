 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803098  Clark  This award provides support to create a regional x-ray  diffration facility on the Boulder campus of the University  of Colorado.  This facility will fill a critical need on the  Colorado Front Range for high resolution, high intensity  laboratory-based x-ray diffraction.  This facility will be  set up, operated, and maintained by the Condensed Matter  Laboratory of the Department of Physics, and will be made  available to materials research groups on the University of  Colorado campus and the Colorado Front Range.    The instrument will be versatile, allowing both high and low  resolution diffraction, will accomodate large sample  chambers, including cryostats, ovens, and magnetic fields,  enabling experimentation over a wide range of sample  temperatures, and will include an area detector, for static  as well as time-resolved diffraction.  The x-ray generator  is a rotating anode system which provides two equivalent,  point source x-ray beams.  One beam will be directed to a 4  cycle diffractometer and scintillation detector for  performing theta - two theta or h-k-l scanned diffraction.  The other beam will be used in conjuction with an area  detector for single crystallography, small angle x-ray  scattering, and time-resolved experiments.  Each beam  path/sample holder/detector assembly will be mounted on its  own optical table and will be independently controlled by  its own computer, a configuration that will enable two  experiments to be performed simultaneously.    This acquisition has broad support among the regional  materials science community, with users from several  University of Colorado Departments, including Physics,  Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and  Geology, as well as from industry and the major Front Range  research institutions, including NIST, the National  Renewable Energy Laboratory, Colorado School of Mines,  Colorado State University, and University of Wyoming.    Ongoing and new Research projects proposed by the PIs and  ini tial roster of users represent a broad spectrum of field  defining condensed phase research.  Experiments are proposed  in the following areas:  structural analysis of liquid  crystals, high Tc superconductors, laser-deposited metal  oxide thin films, new liquid crystal materials development,  structure of ion-selective membranes, development of atomic  layer controlled film growth techniques, characterization of  ribozyme - cationic lipid complexes for transfection of  cells with RNA-based enzymes, structure of phospholipid  phases and tubules, reflectivity studies of polymeric  interfaces, characterization of polymer/monomer -liquid  crystal composites, characterization of ceramic coatings and  films.    The diffractometer system will be clustered with several  other materials characterization instruments and operated as  a self-supporting user facility maintained by a trained  staff member under the direction of the Physics CML  Facilities Committee.  %%%  ***",
