 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726256  Wolfe    Normal faulting and horizontal crustal extension, not just  erosion, ultimately destroy most major mountain belts.  Because  most such belts have been built by crustal shortening and  thickening, some change in the regional geodynamics must occur to  cause such a change from horizontal compression to extension.  One  possibility is that the lower part of the mantle lithosphere,  thickened during the phase of compression, becomes unstable and  sinks into the mantle beneath the range.  When this happens,  the range rises, giving it potential energy to drive normal  faulting.  To test such an idea requires that paleo-altitudes are  measured before and after the normal faulting begins.  The P.I.s  plan to make such measurements using fossil leaf morphology, which  has been calibrated to modern climates (and hence altitudes) with  an extensive collection of such leaf morphology from modern  forests.  The Pacific Northwest is an ideal locality for such  analysis because the region underwent crustal shortening in  Mesozoic time and crustal extension in Cenozoic time and because  there are numerous fossil leaf localities, both  near sea level and inland where a high mountain belt once lay.  ***",
