 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project at the University of Houston is supported by  the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program.  Professor Kevan and  his coworkers use electron magnetic resonance and electron spin  echo modulation spectrometry to elucidate the structural  environment of transition metal ions in microporous and mesoporous  oxide materials.  These aluminophosphate (AlPO) and  silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) compounds are important catalytic  materials, and the work of this project is directed toward  understanding their structure as it relates to catalytic function.   Nickel and manganese ions in particular will be examined, and newly  synthesized hexagonal phase AlPO and SAPO oxides will be emphasized  in these studies.  The materials investigated in this work have  important applications in petroleum refining, and hydrocarbon  process chemistry.  The use of electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy for the  structural elucidation of transition metal ions in oxide materials  is the focus of this research project.  Nickel and manganese ions  incorporated into alumino- and silicoaluminophosphate supports are  being examined.  Connections between structure and function of  these catalytic materials are the expected results of this work,  which has important implications for the development of petroleum  refining catalysts.",
