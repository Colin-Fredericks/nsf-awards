The Math is Power campaign was developed by NACME in partnership with The Advertising Council toward the goal of creating an increase in the number of students who graduate from high school with prerequisite courses to enroll in any rigorous, math- or science-based undergraduate program.      The current project is designed to reach all students but is especially targeted to groups currently underrepresented in math and science and will be anchored by highly directed television, radio, print, and outdoor advertising.   The new phase will introduce a Math is Power interactive web site.  The website will allow NACME to add direct services to the information packets that are sent to students and parents who respond to the public service advertising.   It will include:  content relevant, age appropriate math challenges, games, problems, and contests; a national registry of math opportunities where students, parents, and teachers can find mathematics resources; an on-line special events chat room; and a best practices bulletin board.   NACME will coordinate their outreach efforts with services such as the Community Technology Center Network (CTCnet) in order to facilitate web access for youth and parents in disadvantaged neighborhoods.  They also will work directly with 25 cities with the greatest numbers of citizens who fall in the target population.   Math and Science education services in these cities will be able to localize much of the material through such means as placing a local tag on the television ads.   In addition, the NACME production and distribution capabilities will be substantially expanded to meet the tremendous demand for Math Is Power materials.",
