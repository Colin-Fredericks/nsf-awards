 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hyung Kim is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program to continue his research in chemical reaction dynamics   and electronic spectroscopy in solution.  Kim will implement the   Born-Oppenheimer reaction field theory with quantum chemical techniques   to make a detailed comparison with existing self-consistent methods for   treating solvation.  The solute-solvent electronic correlation effects on   solvation of small molecules and reaction free energetics of charge shift   processes will be investigated.  This approach should clarify some of the   shortcomings associated with the self-consistent approach with regard to   overestimation of activation barriers for 2+2 cycloadditions.    Furthermore, a reaction field approach involving quadrupolar polarization   will also be developed for treating solvent systems such as benzene and   carbon dioxide.  Solvents to be studied include alcohols, amines,   alkanes, cycloalkanes and aromatic systems.  An effort will also be made   to understand and quantify the solvation properties of normal and   supercritical water.  Excellent theories are available for understanding gas phase chemical   reactions involving binary encounters between molecules.  However, most   chemical reactions of technological importance occur in condensed phases   consisting of reacting solutes dissolved in non-reacting solvents. The   effect which the solvent has on chemical reactions, and theoretical   methods for dealing with this complex interaction are still in early   stages of development. Nevertheless, progress in this area of research   can have an important long range impact on our fundamental understanding   of chemical reactions of industrial significance. Kim's research is   helping to provide a theoretical basis for the interpretation of solvent   effects on chemical reactions in condensed phase systems.",
