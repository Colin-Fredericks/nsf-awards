 "awd_abstract_narration": "Profile feedback optimizations have been shown to improve  program performance for several compiler research areas.  The main profiling information used to guide most of these  optimizations are basic block and control flow edge  frequencies.  This is actually only a small fraction of the  profile information that could be gathered and used for  compiler optimizations.  This proposal focuses on two  relatively new areas of profile feedback optimizations.  The  first area will investigate gathering value profiles, which  keep track of the top values for instructions and variables  found during execution.  This information is then used to  guide value-based code specialization, which can  significantly reduce the number of executed instructions.  The second profiling area deals with memory access profiles.  Memory access profiles will be used to guide a new  optimization procedure called Cache-Conscious Data  Placement, as well as to guide speculative instruction  scheduling.  Cache-conscious data placement uses a  temporal relationship memory profile to determine at compile-  time where to place stack, global, heap, and constant  objects in the cache.  This can potentially result in a  significant reduction in the data cache miss rate.  In  addition to the performance benefits from these  optimizations, this research will investigate fast and  efficient approaches for gathering the profile information.",
