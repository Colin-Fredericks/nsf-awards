 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Larsen - 9733756  Prof. Gustavo Larsen of U. Nebraska-Lincoln proposes to molecularly imprint transition metal oxides in order to impart them molecular recognition capabilities for catalytic reactions.  Zircona and titania surfaces will be imprinted by means of templating with dibenzamide, alpha-phenyl propionic acid, or N-benzoylbenzensulfonamide, and will be doped with Cr metal when H-dissociation activity is needed.  They will be characterized gravimetrically, with infrared spectroscopy, by temperature-programmed desorption of alcohols, and by probe reactions to test for chiral selectivity (dehydration or oxidative dehydrogenation of alcohols, and hydrogenation of  alpha-phenyl propionic acid).  The fundamental parameters governing the imprinting of zirconia and the stability at reaction conditions wll be identified.  The research will lead to new knowledge that helps a critical area of heterogeneous catalysis:  the ability to design catalysts with ultra-high selectivity.  If completely successful, the work will impact the fine chemical industries, including pharmaceutical and agrochemical processes.  The educational plan is a comprehensive agenda of activities that may highly affect the scientific human infrastructure in the State of Nebraska.  Part of the educational plan is targeted to junior and senior high-school students, who will be exposed to national laboratory and university research, and thus may will be exposed to national laboratory and university research, and thus may increasingly choose a career in science or engineering.  Some effort will be applied to the insertion of international students in the American system and the enhancement of international collaborations.  In addition, the teaching plan involves research experiences for undergraduate students as well as course development.",
