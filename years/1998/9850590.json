 "awd_abstract_narration": "We will provide instruments in a new 3600-square-foot teaching laboratory located in the Department of Psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, in order to develop state-of-the-art facilities for the teaching of research methods in psychology. The educational process will occur both in formal classes, largely conducted in a new classroom facility, and in individual student projects, conducted in independent-study rooms within the same area.     Our model is for students to take courses in the teaching laboratory that will prepare them for subsequent independent work. Instrumentation will comprise both software and hardware. A principal goal of the planned curriculum development is to enhance the department's research methods courses, which are a cornerstone of our undergraduate program.     We currently teach research methods in cognitive psychology, developmental psychology, and social health psychology. New instrumentation will greatly improve those courses and allow us to add a methods course in cognitive neuroscience. Other curricular developments will occur in courses utilizing brain images, courses teaching computational methods, and faculty-supervised independent research projects. Course materials and tools that are developed will be disseminated over the internet, as a model for the application of particular tools to teaching of research methods.     A Web site will be created to publicize results from classroom curricular development and, when appropriate, tools developed in student projects. The site will provide information about each methods course, including the syllabus, assignments that use the instrumentation (software and hardware), and faculty-developed tutorials for using the instruments. Local and national outcomes will be assessed.",
