 "awd_abstract_narration": "An understanding of the genetic and developmental influences on variation in body size is fundamental to a series of issues in primate and human evolution.  Size change is frequently observed within lineages and also has myriad effects on the physiology, life history and ecology of organisms. Recent work has demonstrated the central role of the systemic growth hormones insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and growth hormone-binding protein (GH-BP) in regulating overall growth rates and terminal body size in primates and other mammals.  There is also evidence that these systemic growth hormones are implicated in the variation in growth patterning frequently observed in lineages undergoing size diversification.    In this project, we will test the hypothesis that serum IGF-1 and GH-BP levels are significantly correlated with growth rates and overall body size variation within and between three species of macaque monkeys.  The relationships will be tested in small (Macaca fascicularis), medium (M. mulatta) and large (M. nemestrina) macaque males of known age and body weight betweeen approximately three and eight years of age, a period of high growth rate and marked size increase.  These data will comprise the first such information collected for an interspecific series of primates, and will contribute to our understanding of the connections between micro- and macroevolutionary size change in higher primate and human evolution.",
