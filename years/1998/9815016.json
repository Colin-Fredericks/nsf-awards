The central goals of this proposed project are to develop the theoretical foundation of visualization design and analysis for effective instruction further. The PI will conduct a series of empirical studies to test research questions from the pilot project.  Redesign an existing Java-based algorithm animation authoring tool into an animation embedded hypermedia information presentation system; and implement this system as a network-enabled distributed visualization construction and delivery tool with a client-server architecture and deploy the tool in an undergraduate course on data structures and algorithms.\r\n\r\nEmpirical studies will test hypotheses derived from the theoretical analysis of the language and assess the educational efficacy of the artifact implementing this language in laboratory and classroom settings.  This project will have scientific, educational, and training aspects.  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n",
