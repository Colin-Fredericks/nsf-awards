The U.S. co-organizers are Dr. John C. Eichelberger and Dr. Jonathan Dehn of the University of Alaska Fairbanks.  The Russian co-organizer is Dr. Boris Ivanov, Director of the Institute of Volcanic Geology and Geochemistry of the Far Eastern Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  The tectonic plate boundary represented by the Aleutian/Alaska and Kamchatka/Kuril Volcanic Arcs, a major planetary structure crossed by international frontiers, is among the most active sites of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions on Earth.  Three factors have led to the scientific neglect of this region: (1) small population and value of assets at risk; (2) politically mandated restrictions on travel; and (3) the challenging conditions of distance and weather.  The first situation has been reversed by the rapid growth of international air traffic between Asia and North America and its vulnerability to volcanic ash, and the second by the end of the Cold War.  Accordingly, it is time for scientists to join together and conquer the third factor.  Approximately 50 researchers from Russia, the U.S., and Japan will meet to exchange ideas and visit field areas of scientific merit which previously have been inaccessible.  Considerable emphasis is being placed on the involvement of graduate students in the conference in order to foster future long-term relationships.\r\n\r\nThis research in seismology and volcanology fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
