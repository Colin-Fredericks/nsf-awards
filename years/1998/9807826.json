 "awd_abstract_narration": "Henry  9807826    Eukaryotic cells are compartmentalized; that is, their cytoplasm is divided into certain functionally and spatially discrete (albeit dynamically interactive) regions, the boundaries of which are most often delineated by membranes.   The chloroplast is such a compartment in green plants.  Chloroplasts contain within them the biochemical and biophysical machinery for photosynthesis, the process whereby light energy is converted into chemical energy.  Photosynthesis in green plants is critical to life on earth as we know it, since it is the source of chemical energy (in the form of sugars and related molecules) not only for the plants themselves but also for essentially all animals and fungi.        In general, protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells takes place in the cytosol, outside any specific intracellular membrane-bound compartment.  Thus, the specific proteins that are found in and function in a particular compartment must be targeted and transported to that location.  The structure of chloroplasts is complex:  there is a double membrane surrounding the so-called stromal, or internal space, and within the stromal space are smaller membrane-bound subcompartments called thylakoids.  In the case of proteins manufactured in the cytosol whose function and ultimate location is in the thylakoids, the proteins must first be imported into the chloroplast and then transported into or across the thylakoid membrane.  This process has been shown to be quite complex, and at least three different sorting pathways have been found that localize imported proteins to the thylakoid.  This project focuses on one of these pathways, which is responsible for localizing Light Harvesting Chlorophyll Protein (LHCP) and certain other integral membrane proteins to the thylakoid membrane.       Of considerable interest is the homology between LHCP localization and protein targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  Both protein-sorting mechanisms require GTP hydrolysis and a ribonucleoprotein complex, termed the signal recognition particle (SRP), that binds to the part of the imported protein that serves as the specific sorting signal. One major difference between the two SRP systems is that the chloroplast SRP operates post-translationally and forms a soluble LHCP/SRP transit complex in the stroma.  The hypothesis of this project is that LHCP in transit complex is targeted to thylakoids by a mechanism that requires an SRP receptor on the thylakoid.  This hypothesis will be explored through experiments designed to identify proteins on the thylakoid that interact with the complex or with SRP.  One approach will be to isolate proteins associated with a thylakoid-bound SRP.  Such binding occurs when assays for LHCP integration are conducted in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, GMP-PNP.  Proteins associated with membrane-bound SRP will be identified by immunoprecipitation with antibody to chloroplast SRP following fractionation of thylakoids solubilized with non-denaturing detergents.  Proteins co-precipitating with the SRP will be isolated from polyacrylamide gels and used to obtain protein sequence information.  A second approach will rely on antibody to E. coli FtsY, a bacterial homologue of the SRP receptor alpha-subunit.  Anti-FtsY, which specifically interacts with a chloroplast protein on immunoblots, will be tested for its ability to inhibit LHCP integration and used to identify a cDNA coding for a chloroplast FtsY.    Successful completion of this project will identify a component(s) of the thylakoid membrane that functions as part of the targeting/integration machinery.  It should then be possible to asses whether other localization pathways in the chloroplast share any of these components.  The results will likely also have impact on investigations of protein localization in bacteria, since virtually nothing is known about the events that take place at the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane when proteins are directed for transport or integration by an SRP homologous mechanism.   Finally, the identification and purification of components that comprise part of the LHCP localization machinery will provide important tools for future studies to more completely understand protein targeting in chloroplasts.",
