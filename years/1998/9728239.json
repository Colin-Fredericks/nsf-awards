 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ray   9728239        The gene SHORT INTEGUMENT (SIN1) is an important regulator of reproductive and vegetative morphogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. Mutations in this gene cause uncoordinated morphogenesis of ovule integument cells, cause a heterochronic shift in the program of meristem fate change, and, so far uniquely in plants, produce a pronounced maternal-effect disruption of embryonic pattern formation. These preliminary studies indicate that SIN1 plays an important role in cell fate specification. We have now proposed two models that address the mechanism by which SIN1 controls meristem fate. Here we propose to:    I.    Clone the SIN 1 gene and determine its sequence.    II.    Test genetic models of how SIN1 regulates flowering time by continuing our analysis of the effects of sin1 mutation on functions of the meristem identity genes APETALA2, and LEAFY, as far as possible during this funding period.    Commitment to inflorescence development is the first important step towards reproductive development in flowering plants. The last important step constitutes fertilization and embryo development which occur within the ovules. The preliminary work described here has established a genetic connection between the earliest and the last steps in plant reproduction. The studies proposed here investigate the mechanisms behind this connection.",
