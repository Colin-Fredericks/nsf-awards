 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 97-28120  McMURRAY      Dr. McMurray and colleagues will investigate a novel mechanism  by which DNA secondary structure within the control region of the  neurotransmitter gene controls both the timing and the level of  neurotransmitter synthesis.  The control region of the  neurotransmitter, proenkephalin, switches between two  conformations that control high or low synthesis states.  Dr.  McMurray and colleagues focus on the mechanism by which switching  occurs.  Preliminary results suggest that an important  transcription factor called CREB stabilizes the high activity  state of synthesis and that CREB degradation facilitates switching  to the low activity state.  Experiments are designed to test this  hypothesis.  The loss of CREB in proenkephalin A complexes will be  monitored after receptor stimulation before and after inhibition  of the degrading enzyme.  This will establish a role for CREB  degradation in control of neurotransmitter synthesis.  The  proteins bound to each form of the control region will be  determined, paying particular attention to the presence of CREB.  Finally, we will identify the composition of protein factors that  control high and low synthesis.  Protein binding and conformation  at the mutant enhancers will be correlated with their ability to  support either low or high expression.    CREB is a major transcription factor that controls memory and  adaptation in the brain.  Through a degradation mechanism, CREB  (with other proteins) appears to control switching and  neurotransmitter synthesis. Such a mechanism provides a direct  path through a gene control region by which CREB controls the  adaptive response of proenkephalin.  The switching mechanism  allows the economical use of gene control element such that a  single site may be utilized in two different ways by the neuron.  We believe that such a switch mechanism is a \"rapid response\"  system by which neurotransmitter synthesis can quickly adapt to  meet a demand of the cell.  A responsive switch that is s ensitive  to phosphorylation may represent a novel, but general pathway to  assemble efficient transcriptional complexes that optimize the  level and timing of neurotransmitter synthesis.",
