 "awd_abstract_narration": "9734130  Sedlak  The objective of this research is to study the fate of  natural and synthetic hormones in three aquatic environments-  laboratory, wastewater treatment and natural river. Since  hormones interact with the endocrine systems of humans and  wildlife, the effect of endocrine disruptors must be  understood and reflected in environmental policies about  chemical use and the management of water resources and water  reuse. To date, most research on endocrine disruption has  focused on industrial chemicals, such as pesticides,  plasticizers and surfactants. However, trace amounts of  natural and synthetic hormones can cause endocrine  disruption and previous measurements of estrogen and related  compounds in urine suggest that these hormones could be more  important to endocrine disruption than other compounds found  in wastewater effluent.    To access the importance of wastewater effluent as a source  of endocrine disrupters, research will be conducted to  determine the environmental fate of estrogens. In the first  phase of this project, new analytical methods will be  developed for measuring estrogens at environmentally  relevant concentrations using enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assays (ELISAs) and gas chromatography. These methods will  then be used to assess the removal of estrogens during  wastewater treatment and their fate in a river that receives  significant discharges of treated wastewater.    A series of interactive demonstrations will be developed and  displayed at public forums to educate the public about  emerging water resource issues. To provide environmental  engineering students with the skills needed to address  problems associated with resource conservation and reuse, a  series of graduate-level courses will be developed. These  courses will consist of a lecture course, a laboratory  course and a graduate seminar that highlight the role that  environmental engineers can play in solving problems related  to the conservation and reuse of resources.",
