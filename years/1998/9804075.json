 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804075  This project will focus on the detection in real time of system  misuse.  This will be achieved through the dynamic measurement of  software systems.  This technique has been quite successful in  the dynamic determination of software reliability. Through a  shift in perspective the variation of the behavior that  determines system reliability also provides a convenient vehicle  for the detection of security violations.  The research effort  will center around three distinct software system attributes:  granularity, scalability, and the operating milieu of the target  software system. Thus, initial project phase will concentrate on  the instrumentation and measurement of O/S kernel level program  activity. The next project phase will center on the dynamic  determination of specific application (user) profiles. The third  project phase will shift the measurement focus to network-wide  software applications. This new metaphor for secure systems will  focus on the functionality that the system is executing and the  impact that the functionality has on program modularity, as  opposed to the existing view of the system's software as a  monolithic system being stimulated by an aggressive and hostile  user.  A system will be measured as it executes its many  functionalities, profile will be established for normal activity,  and subtle shifts in the profiles that represent the execution of  security breach functionalities will be identified and  modeled.***",
