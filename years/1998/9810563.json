 "awd_abstract_narration": "Diatoms and Cold Water: A novel hypothesis regarding nitrate uptake and  reduction  Blooms of diatoms are common in temperate, upwelling, and polar regions,  and most often occur in cool waters when the environmental conditions such  as upwelling, mixing, or runoff increase the flux of nitrate to the system.  It has often been shown that diatoms do not exhibit the preference for  ammonium typically observed for other phytoplankton, but the physiological  basis for why nitrate is taken up disproportionately is not well  understood. Based on published data and preliminary experiments, a  hypothesize is proposed that diatoms thrive in cold, nitrate-rich water as  a result of interactions between their carbon and nitrogen metabolisms.  Specifically, this study will try to establish that nitrate, which can be  accumulated at high concentrations by diatoms, may serve as a sink for  excess electron flux that results episodically from an imbalance between  production of electrons in the light reactions of photosynthesis (which is  temperature insensitive) and the consumption of electrons in the dark  reactions (i.e. carbon fixation, which is temperature sensitive). Different  temperature optima for the enzymes involved in nitrate reduction, nitrate  reductase and carbon fixation, ribulose-biphosphate-carboxylase, also come  into play. It appears that nitrate reductase has a much lower temperature  optimum, making it a more favorable electron acceptor in cold water.  Consequently, the rate of nitrate uptake is negatively correlated with  temperature, at least over the temperature range of -8-20'C.  The significance of this work lies in the development of a physiological  explanation for why diatoms bloom when nitrate levels are high and waters  are cool. The negative relationship between nitrate uptake and temperature  argues strongly for the incorporation of temperature functions in models of  new production. Lastly, should nitrate serve as a mechanism for energy  dissipation, then release of nitrogen from these cells in the form of  nitrite or organic nitrogen would be expected. This study will seek to  determine the fraction of nitrate that is reduced for maintenance of  cellular nitrogen requirements, and how much is reduced via other  regulatory mechanisms in the cells. If a significant fraction of nitrate is  reduced simply as an energy dissipatory mechanism then estimates of new  production based solely on nitrate uptake could be seriously biased.",
