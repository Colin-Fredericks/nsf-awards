 "awd_abstract_narration": "Essential to our understanding of a large number of  biological processes is the characterization of molecular  structure and molecular interactions. Faculty at the  University of Califomia San Diego proposes to establish a  Macromolecular Biophysics Facility (MBF) to advance these  types of studies. The function of the MBF is to provide the  necessary instrumentation for biomolecular and biophysical  studies and to facilitate interactions between investigators  at UCSD with interests in biophysical and biomolecular  research. The primary goal of the MBF is to create a  biophysical infrastructure that will make essential  instrumentation readily available and at the same time foster  interactions between researchers. Instruments to be provided  by this project include a circular dichroism spectrometer to  analyze secondary structure of proteins and conformational  changes due to ligand binding, an analytical ultracentrifuge  for the characterization of the physical properties of  macromolecules, and a surface plasmon resonance instrument  for the study of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and ligand  receptor interactions. These instruments will be combined  with peptide synthesis and N-terminal sequencing  instrumentation currently located in individual laboratories  that will be contributed to the facility.    The MBF will be used by a diverse set of faculty for  biophysical analysis of macromolecules including analysis of  protein-protein, protein-lipid, and protein-nucleic acid  interactions important in such diverse biological processes  as cell-cell interactions, signal transduction and  transcription. To be effective, a facility such as this must  be properly administered and maintained. The aim of the  facility is not simply to purchase state-of-the-art  instrumentation, but to establish a well-coordinated facility  where staff will be available for training students,  postdoctoral fellows, and faculty. The MBF is part of a  concerted effort to maximize the research environment at UCSD  an d to foster interdisciplinary research efforts. The MBF  will join three other existing centers at UCSD (the NIR  Research Resource for Data Collection, the National Center  for Microscopy and Imaging Research, and the National  Biological Computing Resource) under the umbrella of the  newly formed Center for Research in Biological Structure and  will complement the existing centers by providing crucial  common analysis instruments for macromolecular biophysics.",
