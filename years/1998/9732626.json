The overriding  objective of this project has been and continues to be to  encourage members of under-represented minority groups and  women to pursue careers in physics.  Applications are  solicited nationally from undergraduate programs in physics  and engineering with particular emphasis on historically  black colleges and traditional women's colleges and local  Chicago area and Midwestern colleges and universities.  The  core of the program for each student participant is a  research project under supervision of an individual faculty  member.  Each student is given specific, well defined  research task that can be completed within the ten-week  duration of the program.  The research groups in which  projects are conducted are experimental for the most part,  but have included quite a few theoretical projects.  Typical  projects are distributed among the areas of high energy  physics, cosmic ray and space physics, astronomy and  astrophysics, general relativity, condensed matter physics,  optics and solar energy, and electron and ion microscopy.  ***",
