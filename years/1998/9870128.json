A coordinated, three-pronged  approach is proposed which involves the synthesis of new  functionalized polymers, measurements of rheological and shear-  induced structural changes, and theory.  Highly monodisperse  polymers, with well defined molecular weights, will be  synthesized and will be quantitatively end-capped with functional  groups designed to promote associations between polymers.  The  functional groups will be placed in one of four configurations:  (1) at one end of each chain or (2) at both ends of the chains or  (3) halfway along the backbone of the chains or (4) at both ends  and halfway along the chain length.  The degree of branching at  the physical crosslinks will be controlled using metal ions with  different coordination numbers.  The degree of the association  (or lifetime of associations) will be controlled by the addition  of cosolvents which serve as \"poisons\" for the associating  groups.  In addition to extensive rheological measurements of  shear and normal stresses, in situ direct measurements of the  degree of association will be performed as a function of shear  rate using uv/vis absorption spectroscopy.  In situ measurements  of flow-induced alignment of polymers will be performed using  birefringence.  Small and large angle light scattering  measurements of the static structure factor S(q) as a function of  shear rate will be used to follow flow-induced structural  changes.  The growth of the shear-induced gel under shear flow  will be followed using the newly developed light scattering  microscopy technique.  The experimental work will be closely  coordinated with an intensive program of theoretical research.  Theoretical and experimental studies will commence with work on a  model polymer solution in which each chain contains a single,  terminally-attached sticker and progress towards more  complex  sticker placement as well as issues of network formation and  gelation.  %%%  Associating polymer solutions find wide use in industrial  applications as viscosity modifiers, anti-misting or anti-  splatter agents, coagulants in coatings, and blocking agents in  oil recovery.  The utility of these systems stems from a number  of important physical properties, including their ability to  significantly enhance solution viscosity with the addition of  very small amounts of polymer, their ability to control and even  reverse the reduction of viscosity with temperature (this  capability is important for many lubricants), their ability to  suppress misting and splatter, and their ability to gel under  certain conditions.  The purpose of this research program is to  develop an understanding of the molecular factors which determine  the physical properties of these systems in order to engineer  these systems for practical industrial applications.  ***",
