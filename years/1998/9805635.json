 "awd_abstract_narration": "9805635\r\n\r\nDespite significant research and development efforts, usage of partially restrained (PR) principles has been very slow in coming to the marketplace.  This is clearly and primarily caused by a lack of understanding and appreciation of the applications of PR principles on the part of designers, but also due to the lack of suitable software. Practical implementation of the use of PR connections in structural systems by designers is a real possibility, but to get to that stage requires a well-planned technology transfer effort.  For this workshop, Lehigh University will work with the Structural Stability Research Council (SSRC) to conduct a one-day workshop on the topic of frames with partially restrained connections.  The focus of the workshop will be to assess state-of-the-art research and research needs in the subject area, examine criteria for design specification development, and develop and recommend implementation and technology transfer into practice.  The workshop will be held in Atlanta, Georgia on September 23, 1998.  Workshop topics include:  1) frame stability; 2) connection performance; 3) influence on seismic effects; 4) analysis and design technologies; and, 5) practical implementation and technology transfer.\r\nPresented papers and reports of discussion sessions will be published\r\nin a set of proceedings by SSRC.\r\n****\r\n\r\n\r\n",
