This  fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain  additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue innovative and imaginative research into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular, cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled Arabidopsis  mutants disrupted in light and sucrose response pathways.  Light is a fundamental environmental cue utilized by plants  to signal a variety of morphological and metabolic  processes. Sucrose, a product of light regulated  photosynthesis, has feed-back activity by suppressing light-  activated genes. The asparagine synthase gene (ASI) is  repressed by both light and sucrose. This unique repressive  regulation by both light and sucrose on the AS1 promoter is  being used in a positive selection. strategy to isolate  mutations in the light and sucrose signal transduction  pathways.",
