 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last 30 years, the connection between bacteria and phytoplankton at a whole population level has been evaluated. Recent advances in the analysis of nucleic acids in natural samples has demonstrated microbial diversity is greater than had previously been thought; however, elucidating the linkages between bacterial and phytoplankton diversity has not yet been attempted despite a great deal of evidence these populations are tightly coupled. Dr. Kerkhof will identify specific bacteria and phytoplankton co stimulated during upwelling in the coastal ocean.  He will build on preliminary evidence demonstrating a linkage between bacteria and phytoplankton during an upwelling event off New Jersey in 1995.   Dr. Kerkhof will use molecular tools coordinated with a state of the art observational network and shipboard sampling to further elucidate these connections between bacteria and phytoplankton during four upwelling events (1 4 weeks) in the Mid Atlantic Bight (MAB). The research will provide an unprecedented picture of microbial community processes, diversity, and dynamics during episodic events in the coastal ocean. Ultimately, this understanding of microbial processes in the MAB will aid in developing a predictive capability for the near shore coastal ocean to forecast regional and global biogeochemical cycling.",
