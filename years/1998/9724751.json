Wilkes at the  Super-Kamiokande Neutrino Observatory, Mozumi, Japan,  operated by the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR),  Tokyo, Japan.  Dr. Wilkes's student, Mr. Ross Doyle, will  work with Professor Yoji Totsuka, Director of ICRR, on a  research project entitled \"Atmospheric Neutrino Observations  with Super-Kamiokande\".    Evidence from experiments conducted over the last two  decades consistently suggests there is a discrepancy between  the number of electron neutrinos observed coming from the  sun and the number that might be expected.  Experiments such  as Homestake, SAGE, Kamiokande II, and GALLEX have all  reported fewer electron neutrinos than standard models  predict.  Because no solar models have yet been developed  that are adequately able to both predict the observed level  of neutrinos and yet account for all the other observed  features of the sun, the possibility of neutrino  oscillations has been invoked as an explanation for the  measured deficit of one species.  The proposed research is  designed to determine whether these neutrino oscillations  actually occur and, if so, measure the solar electron  neutrino flux with greater accuracy than has been  accomplished previously.  ***",
