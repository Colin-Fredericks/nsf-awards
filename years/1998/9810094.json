 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810094  Storm    A Gordon Research Conference will be held July 12-17, 1998 on  theoretical and experimental aspects of defects and defect-  related phenomena in homogeneous and structured semiconductors,  associated with growth and processing of electronic materials.  Topics which are controversial and/or forward-looking will be  emphasized. The program is organized around 20 invited speakers,  11 discussion leaders, a chair, vice-chair, and program  committee; both contributed papers and posters are scheduled.  Objectives are to stimulate communications among the broad  community of researchers who address defects from a variety of  disciplinary backgrounds--chemistry, physics, engineering and  materials science, and to formulate and delineate critical  research necessary to further basic understanding and move  concepts closer to technological success. The conference is  expected to provide an effective forum for discussion of critical  scientific issues in the area of defects in semiconductors. Along  with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions,  it is expected that new ties will be established between  universities, research institutions, and industry.  %%%   An evaluation of the progress and status of defects and defect-  related phenomena in semiconductors associated with growth and  processing of electronic materials and device related structures  along with current assessments of the most important developments  in this field will be of great value to the understanding and  enhanced utilization of materials in computing, data processing,  and communications.  ***",
