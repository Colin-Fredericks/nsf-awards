 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study of the structure of nucleons and the role of  quarks in determining this structure will be performed using  the tagged photon system in Hall B at the Thomas Jefferson  National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Laboratory).  The  photon tagger, which was in large part designed and built by  the Catholic University of America (CUA) group, measures the  energy of the photon that produces a reaction in a nuclear  target.  The reaction products are then measured by the  CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer (CLAS).       The CUA group is an active participant in the CLAS  Collaboration, a partnership of many user groups devoted to  constructing, and using the instrumentation in Hall, B to  perform a variety of experiments concurrently.  During the  initial phase of the CLAS program, the CUA group is most  deeply involved in two experiments:  the photoproduction of  strange particles (K mesons and hyperons), and the helicity  structure of pi meson photoproduction.  The former  experiment, designed to probe the role of strange quarks in  the proton, will provide a data sample more than 100 times  larger than that previously available.  The latter,  requiring both a polarized photon beam and a polarized  proton target, will constitute part of a test of the Drell-  Hearn-Gerasimov sum rule, a fundamental quantity of  worldwide interest.  The CUA group is also participating in  two experiments which use the tagged photon beam without the  CLAS:  a measurement of the photofission probabilities for  heavy nuclei, and a measurement of the rare decays of the  phi meson.",
