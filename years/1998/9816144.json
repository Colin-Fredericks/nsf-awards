 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project explores a new theoretical approach to engineering design and integration engineering.  The goal is to formulate and analyze a rigorous mathematical framework for design and manufacturability, based on clearly specified, computerized protocols using well-defined choice sets.  Because such computerized methods are inherently discrete, the first step will be to examine the possibilities for approximation by models with continuous decision variables.  If this is successful, and when the engineering design problem can be described by continuous parameters, then constrained optimization of a well-behaved objective function over a set of feasible or manufacturable designs would yield well-behaved solutions.       If successful, this research will lead to an improved understanding of engineering design and manufacture, with potential positive impact on nearly all of industry and having potentially revolutionary impact on engineering education.",
