 "awd_abstract_narration": "98-09907  CHODOBSKI      Vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone is a \"neurohormone,\" that is  a hormone produced by nerve cells (\"neurons\").  It was originally  found in specialized groups of neurons located in a region of the  brain termed the \"hypothalamus\".  These neurons send long thread-  like processes (\"axonal fibers\") to the pituitary gland where  their vasopressin is released into the blood stream. Two major  physiological actions of this neurohormone, as its names imply,  are the conservation of water and the maintenance of blood  pressure in response to the loss of body fluids.  Normal central  nervous system (CNS) function is critically dependent upon the  maintenance of an optimal composition  and volume of intra- and  extracellular fluids.  Small changes in these parameters can alter  neuronal signaling and information processing.  An increasing body  of evidence indicates that vasopressin is not only secreted into  the blood stream, but is also released within the CNS to regulate  brain fluid balance.  However, the sources of centrally-released  vasopressin are incompletely characterized.  Recent observations  by Dr. Chodobski and his collaborators indicate that one potential  source of this central vasopressin is the choroid plexus, an organ  that is located within the cerebral ventricles (fluid-filled  chambers inside the brain) and that is the primary site of  cerebrospinal fluid formation.  It is therefore hypothesized that  the choroid plexus-derived vasopressin is involved in the  regulation of fluid economy in the brain. The objectives of this  project are to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the synthesis,  release, and putative actions in the CNS of choroidal vasopressin.  To this end, choroid plexus cell culture systems and animal models  will be used.  The experiments will involve molecular, cellular,  and physiological approaches.  The studies proposed in this  application will generate data to fill the 'information gap' in an  important area of neuronal microenvironmen t maintenance.",
