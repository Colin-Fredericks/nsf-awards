 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal task of this project is to provide a detailed description  and analysis of the language of the Mekens people. They collectively  refer to themselves and to their language as Sakurabiat (sakirabiat)  nowadays. Mekens is one of the five surviving languages of the Tupari  linguistic family (Tupi stock), and it is spoken in the state of  Rondonia, Northwest of Brazil, by about 23 speakers. Due to its small  number of speakers and to the fact that only two children are currently  learning it, Mekens figures among the most endangered languages of the  world. It is also, together with the majority of Brazilian languages,  one for which very little information is known. Therefore, this research  will enrich linguistic knowledge by gathering and analyzing primary  linguistic data of an endangered language that has never been studied  before, and for which very little material is available. Except for an  article describing its phonological segments (Hanke et. al. 1958), the  only other materials are the results of the researcher's own preliminary  work with the language. The specific goals of the project are (i) to  proceed with the documentation of the language, through the collection  of a wide range of linguistic data, both through elicitation and through  the recording of natural speech, such as conversation, and narratives,  (ii) to provide a description and analysis of the language, in terms of  its morphological and syntactic properties, (iii) to continue the  implementation of the literacy project, which was started in Summer  1996, (iv) in the long term, to contribute to a Tupi comparative project  currently in development by linguists associated to the Museum Emilio  Goeldi (Brazil). Field research will be conducted in the Mekens  settlement in Rondonia (Brazil) for a period of twelve months. This  research project aims to provide the basis for the researcher's doctoral  dissertation, in which an analytic-descriptive grammar of Mekens will be  presented, providing a coherent accou nt of the many interesting  morphosyntactic phenomena found in the language, such as the  switch-reference system in verbal person marking, and the system of  auxiliaries which marks person and position of the verb S/A arguments  and tense/aspect of the clause, adding to the current understanding of  these and other phenomena in natural languages.",
