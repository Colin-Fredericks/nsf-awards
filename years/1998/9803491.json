 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803491  The proposed project is concerned with developing a formal basis  for object-oriented (OO) analysis and design modeling. There are  two major components to the research: OO concept formalization  and method development. In the concept formalization phase, core  OO modeling concepts and their compositions are identified and  precisely characterized, and rigorous techniques for analyzing  and refining/elaborating OO models are developed. The focus of  the method development phase is on the creation of a rigorous  software development method, based on the standard Unified  Modeling Language (UML), that utilizes the formalized concepts  produced in the previous phase.  The proposed research will  deepen understanding of OO modeling and analysis concepts, and  pave the way for the development of rigorous development methods  based on OO modeling techniques. The research is also intended to  produce results that can be used as part of the foundation for  ongoing efforts at standardizing OO modeling language  semantics.***",
