 "awd_abstract_narration": "For many animals, vibrations transmitted by air or water  provide information about the local three-dimensional environment.  Often there are extremely complex mechanosensory systems  integrating extremely complex stimulus fields.  This collaborative  research project exploits a small aquatic crustacean, a copepod,  as a novel model system that can be considered much simpler than  the insects and large crustaceans used in other analyses.  The  copepod brain has fewer than 1000 neurons and lives in a simple  flow environment where the animal creates a feeding current across  the antennae.  This current has some local turbulence in the open,  but is converted to a smooth laminar flow field across the  antenna.   Microscale hydrodynamics, receptor neurophysiology and  behavioral studies are used to clarify the mechanisms that  transduce the 3-D information of natural signals into a neural  signal, and underlie behavior such as feeding or escape from  swimming predators detected by this small but sophisticated  mechanosensory system.      Results will be important for understanding 3-D processing in  mechanosensory systems, and there is potential impact beyond  neuroscience to biological oceanography because of the importance  of copepods in the food web, and potential impact on the design of  biosensors and robotic sensory technology.",
