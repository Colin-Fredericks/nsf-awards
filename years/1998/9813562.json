 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study is designed to determine the effects of the current (1997-98) El Ni\u00b9o event on the nearshore giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) communities throughout this species entire range (central Baja, Mexico to A\u00b9o Nuevo, California; see Foster & Schiel, 1985 for a review on giant kelp distribution).  The current (1997-98) El Ni\u00b9o is considered one of the strongest on record (NOAA Multivariate ENSO Index) with widespread, storm-induced damage already occurring along much of the eastern Pacific.  In addition to widespread damage to terrestrial environments from flooding and strong winds, unusually large ocean waves have impacted the coast of California and Baja, having severe impacts on their coastal marine systems.  To examine the effects of the current El Ni\u00b9o event on the giant kelp forests of this region, field surveys will be done to compare changes in their community structure resulting from large ocean waves and increased sea temperatures before, during and after this event, and throughout their entire range in this region. Collected data will be supplemented by unpublished data from the PI's as well as published research on kelps in the area. Altogether, these data will allow for evaluation of both inter- and intraannual variation in the structure of giant kelp communities along their entire distribution in the Pacific Northeast, with specific attention on years characterized by El Ni\u00b9o and La Ni\u00b9a events, and provide valuable information on the relative importance of various oceanographic conditions on these changes.",
