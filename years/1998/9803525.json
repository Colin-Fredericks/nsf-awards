 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the continuation and expansion of \r\nthe research and scientific training in applied mathematics at the Center \r\nfor Nonlinear Analysis in the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Carnegie \r\nMellon University. Research will focus on the mathematical description and \r\nprediction of a range of phenomena that occur in material science \r\napplications. The study of mathematical models for novel man-made materials \r\nsuch as shape memory alloys, ferroelectric, magnetic and magnetostrictive \r\nmaterials, composites, liquid crystals, and thin films, will play a central \r\nrole in the program. Phase transitions, defectiveness and defect \r\npropagation, grain boundaries and their evolution, the prediction of \r\nmacroscopic behavior and its interplay with microstructural features, \r\nsuperconductivity, elasto-plastic systems, hyperbolic conservation laws, \r\nstability, metastability, and other topics will be addressed. The study of \r\nthese questions will advance the frontiers of nonlinear analysis and \r\nscientific computation.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this work is to identify and develop new applications of the \r\nmathematical sciences. The main focus will be on nonlinear behavior of \r\nmaterials and concomitant issues in analysis and computation. Large scale \r\ncomputing will play a central role in all of our work. The Center will \r\npromote close collaboration between mathematicians and scientists from other \r\nfields. Main activities will be centered around intense, short workshops on \r\nselected topics at the forefront of interdisciplinary research, a \r\npostdoctoral training program where emphasis will be placed on research \r\nopportunities available at the interface between the mathematical and \r\nphysical sciences, and a visitors program. The visitors program and the \r\nworkshops will be coordinated around research themes selected on an annual \r\nbasis. Some of our resources will be devoted to a secondary research \r\nthrust in mathematical finance.  \r\n",
