 "awd_abstract_narration": "The assertion that inner city consumers face higher market prices for food than their more affluent counterparts has received mixed support since the late 1960s. Recent inquiries into this question appear to reach a consensus that the poor indeed pay more for food. However, these studies utilize samples drawn on the basis of prior knowledge of unfair pricing strategies, proximity of volunteer surveyors, or another nonrandom method. The effect of these methodological errors in survey and sample design on the results obtained is unknown. This project revisits the issue of pricing structures by analyzing unpublished price level data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for use in computing the Consumer Price Index to answer the question of whether prices are higher in poor, urban neighborhoods. The contribution of this  project is to analyze a large, statistically representative sample of stores in poor and affluent neighborhoods,  and  to test empirically the major arguments in support of a differential.  We examine rent seeking among store owners that is believed to result in discriminatory pricing strategies; the effect of store operating costs, transportation constraints, and lack of competition on prices; and the effect of concentrated poverty on pricing strategies.",
