 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal # DMS-9731097  PI: Harvey Segur  Title: Nonlinear Wave Motion       The Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation is a nonlinear partial  differential equation in two spatial dimensions plus time.  It is one of   very few nonlinear equations that: (i) is completely integrable and admits   \"soliton\" solutions;  (ii) involves two spatial dimensions plus time; and   (iii) arises naturally in  physics.  Specifically, the equation describes   approximately the motion of ocean waves in shallow water.  (Ocean waves   require two spatial dimensions because they occur on the water's   two-dimensional surface.)  For this application, the most interesting   solutions  are either exactly or approximately periodic, just as typical   ocean waves are approximately periodic.  Based on recent discoveries of the   mathematical structure of this equation, we can now solve this problem as   an initial-value problem for initial data that are either exactly or   approximately periodic in space.  The work to be carried out in this study   will exploit this structure to build an accurate model of waves in shallow   water.  The waves in the model will be as complicated as waves in the   ocean usually are: steady or unsteady, with either exact or approximate   periodicity in time or in space or both, with arbitrarily large amplitudes,   and with fully two-dimensional spatial patterns.  No other functioning   model of water waves includes all of these features simultaneously, so this   model should vastly improve our ability to predict waves in shallow water.      Nonlinear phenomena occur when a perturbation to a system triggers  a response that is not proportional to the perturbation.  Many of the   dramatic events in nature are nonlinear, including the \"big bang\"  in   cosmology, sonic booms in aerodynamics, hurricanes and breaking ocean waves   in geophysics.  The mathematical models used to describe these phenomena   are intrinsically nonlinear, and typically we cannot solve them in any   general sense.   The set  of models that admit \"solitons\" and are   \"completely integrable\" are exceptions to this rule: usually these models   can be solved in complete detail, and they have provided great insight into   the nature of nonlinear wave phenomena.  The work to be carried out in this   study will exploit recently a discovered mathematical structure of one of these   completely integrable models to build an accurate and realistic model of   ocean waves in shallow water.  Practical implications of more accurate   predictions of shallow water waves include better control of beach erosion,   fewer problems with shoreline pollution from dispersal of man-made waste,   and better design of offshore structures like oil platforms.",
