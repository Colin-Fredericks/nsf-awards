It is important to determine the molecular mechanisms for these  cytokine actions for a general understanding of nervous system  development.  The recently described \"neuropoietic\" cytokines have  potential roles in the developing nervous and cardiovascular  systems which are, as yet, largely undefined. The overall goal of  this study is to understand the functional role of the cytokine  ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in development of the heart and  its innervation. The mechanisms important for expression of CNTF  receptors during development will be investigated, the molecular  mechanisms that regulate these receptors in heart tissue and in  cultured myocytes during parasympathetic synapse formation will be  defined, and the effects of CNTF on key synaptic components will  be identified in the heart.  Upon completion of the project three  fundamental questions will have been addressed. (1) Does the  change in CNTF receptor levels result in changes in tissue CNTF  sensitivity?  (2) What is (are) the mechanism(s) of regulation of  CNTF receptors in heart?  (3) Does CNTF play a role in  parasympathetic synapse formation in the developing atria?  Over  the long term, downstream gene and biochemical targets of CNTF and  related cytokine action in heart will be determined. These studies  represent some of the first to define the expression and function  of CNTF receptors in the cardiovascular system. With this new  information we will have a better understanding of the mechanisms  that regulate nerve-heart cell responses to cytokines during  embryonic development and of mechanisms that may be important for  maintenance of these functions in the adult.",
