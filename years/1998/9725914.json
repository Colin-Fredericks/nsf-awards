 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725914  Khalil    The University of Miami will organize a workshop to examine the industry's demand for education in the Management of Technology (MOT) field.  The fast pace of technological change and the globalization of the marketplace are forcing industry to change.  These changes require personnel who are educated and capable of dealing with the emerging paradigms of technology and business.  Educational programs have been slow in their response to the need for MOT education.  They continue to compartmentalize education into either engineering or business schools, and barriers motivated primarily by turf protection continue to exist.  The proposed workshop will identify the needs that justify the creation of MOT programs as well as the rationale for revamping existing curricula in science, engineering, and business schools.  The participants will examine whether there is a demand for MOT education, and if so, what its content should be.  They also will examine whether education is meeting that demand.  This approach is based on listening to industry.  Representatives from major industrial corporations will be invited to the workshop.  In preparation for it, they will be asked to attend or to send a representative to the Seventh International Conference on Management of Technology in Orlando, Florida in February 1998.  Each invitee will be asked to prepare a short position paper summarizing his/her industry's demand for education and training in MOT.  A follow-up one-day workshop to discuss responses and summarize ideas will be held in late March or early April, and a report will be published in the summer of 1998.  It is postulated that if there is an industrial demand and the demands are clarified, universities are likely to respond.",
