 "awd_abstract_narration": "9707195  Ho    This project aims to use variable low temperature scanning  tunneling microscopy operating under ultrahigh vacuum conditions  to induce and view directly the dissociation and formation of  chemical bonds with atomic resolution of molecules adsorbed on  metal surfaces.  Chemistry is reduced to studying single  molecules in isolation, including the structure and reactivity of  individual bonds in a molecule, and as other molecules are  brought to the isolated molecule one at a time.  The overall  complexity encountered in an ensemble of many interacting  molecules will be removed and added in a controlled way.  %%%  This investigation will provide important advances in our  understanding of chemical and biological systems.  The study of  the intrinsic properties of single molecules (isolated from  intermolecular or collective or environmental effects) and their  controlled interactions and reactions with other molecules is  relevant to the advancement of emerging technologies such as  those based on electronic and optical nanostructured materials.  ***",
