 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hua Guo at the University of Toledo is supported by the NSF Theoretical   and Computational Chemistry Program for theoretical investigations of   chemical reaction dynamics.  His two major areas of research are   iterative methods for solving generalized eigenproblems and classical   trajectory simulations of surface photochemical processes.  New efficient   numerical methods will be used to calculate both bound and resonant   spectra of systems of atmospheric and combustion interest, as well as   absorption spectra of predissociative systems.  Surface-aligned   photochemical processes will be studied with classical trajectory   simulations of adsorbate-adsorbate and adsorbate-substrate interactions.  The concern of this work is understanding the spectroscopic and dynamical   properties of large molecular systems, in the gas phase and on surfaces.    The details of photo-induced chemistry, in general, and of   photodissociation, in particular, depend on the interaction energies   among the atoms in the system. However, it is not simple to correlate   these to the identity of the reaction products and to the energy   distribution over these products.  The studies being carried out in this   project will enhance the understanding of the relevant relationships and   stimulate new experimetnal explorations.",
