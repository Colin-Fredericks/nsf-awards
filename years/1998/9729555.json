 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Lawrence F. Dahl of the Department of Chemistry, University of   Wisconsin at Madison, is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division to continue his studies   on high-nuclearity metal carbonyl clusters.  The main thrust of this   project is the synthesis, X-ray structural characterization, and   structure-bonding analysis of new high-nuclearity (10 or more metal   atoms) homo- and hetero-metallic carbonyl clusters.  The synthesis of a   series of palladium-carbonyl-phosphine clusters will be optimized and   extended to include clusters with different phosphine ligands.  This   series, including a cluster with 59 Pd atoms, will be studied by proton   NMR to determine if hydrido-like H atoms are present.  New Pd-Ni clusters   will be synthesized in sufficient amounts to permit physical/chemical   characterization.  These clusters will be reacted with phosphine ligands   to determine the ligand effect on metal segregation since previous   clusters of this type have shown a surprising degree of metal order.  A   novel carbonyl-phosphine-hydrido cluster with 28 Pd and 12 Pt atoms will   be further studied by NMR and hydrogen-deuterium exchange, and   synthetically extended by incorporation of additional Pt and Ni atoms.    The preparation of a series of Ni-Pd(or Pt)-Rh(or Ir) carbonyl-hydrido   clusters with unprecedented metal frameworks will be attempted.  The   challenging characterization of these unusual clusters will be   accomplished by the combination of X-ray crystallography (CCD area   detector), electrospray ionization Fourier-transform ion cyclotron   resonance mass spectrometry, X-ray fluorescence, magnetic susceptibility,   and NMR measurements.   Theoretical studies on several clusters including   a 18-atom Ni-Au cluster will be carried out using density functional   methods that include relativistic effects in order to determine the   nature of the Ni-Au bonds and to compare the results to those of previous   calculations using the Fenske-Hall MO model.  Finally, synthetic methods   will be improved and optimized to prepare larger amounts of recently   discovered 38-metal Au-Pd-Ni and  35-metal Cu-Ni clusters for   physical-chemical studies.  This project will add fundamental knowledge about bonds between metal   atoms, especially ones between different metal types.  The large discreet   metal clusters also can serve as models for metal particles and surfaces   and contribute fundamentally to our understanding of surface science,   metal-particle physics, and heterogeneous catalysis.  The multi-metal   palladium clusters have potential technological importance in the design   of new materials with useful catalytic, electronic, magnetic, optical,   and hydrogen storage/isotope separation  properties.  This work also   advances state-of-the-art methods of chemical analysis by applying these   techniques to extraordinarily demanding problems.",
