University of Wisconsin  Title: The Evolution of Climate and Biosphere During the Past 20  Million Years    Studies of the Earth's history show that the large climate changes  of the past have been associated with equally large changes in the  biosphere, the deep ocean, the large continental ice sheets, and  the earth's carbon cycle.  This award supports a study of large  climate changes of the past using numerical models of the  atmosphere, the land surface, terrestrial ecosystems, oceans, ice-  sheets, and components of the carbon cycle.  In the past, large  climate changes were initiated by tectonically-related changes in  land-ocean distribution, by the rise and fall of mountains, and by  changes in earth's orbital parameters.  By prescribing changes in  these \"external\" forcings of climate, it is possible to use models  to simulate the climate's direct response , and to study possible  feedback mechanisms involving the biosphere, or the cryosphere that  might amplify or dampen the direct response.  The great advantage  of using the past as a \"testing ground\" for studies of climate  change is that geological records from terrestrial and marine  environments can be compared with the results of the simulations to  evaluate the accuracy of the models.  The specific testing ground  chosen for this study is the most recent major glaciation that  began about 20 million years ago.  Large changes in the atmospheric  concentration of CO2 probably played a role in situation and will  be an important focus of the project.  The results of this work  will lead to improved understanding of the mechanisms involved in  this  large climate changes of the past and will help assess the  accuracy of models being developed to estimate possible climate  changes of the future.",
