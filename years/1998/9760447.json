 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9760447  Colvin    This  Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I program will investigate the use of microencapsulated phase change materials (microPCMs) to control and stabilize plant surface temperatures within a range that protects the plant tissue against low temperature damage.  The project will study ways to stabilize the microenviromnent temperature on the plant surface with microPCMs as an impetus to develop a safe, economical, and effective method for controlling frost damage in the agricultural and horticultural industries.  Microencapsulated phase change materials (microPCMs) - developed by Triangle Research and Development Corporation (TRDC) on multiple SBIR programs from 1984 to 1996 - will be selected and used in this program.  TRDC has already developed coatings for textiles and aircraft that can control temperature at temperatures from ambient to 1,000 degrees F.  A wide array of potential temperature stabilizing microPCMs are available for testing and based on ongoing research, we know that microPCMs go into suspension well, can be easily applied to plant surfaces, and have demonstrated a compatibility on plants tested thus far in other unrelated work.  The proposed research would demonstrate the effectiveness of microPCMs to slow or prevent cooling of the leaf or flower surfaces to a level where protection of the tissue is achieved.    Annually, significant portions of citrus fruits, deciduous tree fruits, small fruits, winter vegetables, ornamentals, and cereal crops are lost to frost/freeze damage.  For the fruit industry alone, which is worth eight to ten billion dollars in the United States, losses are consistently high.  The market potential for a successful product for frost/freeze protection of this nature would be enormous.  For the horticultural industry, conservative estimates for frost damage in the U.S. is near the billion dollar figure.  This research may provide a solution to these problems and markets.  ***",
