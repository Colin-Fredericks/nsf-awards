 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kasperson  Industrial Restructuring and Corporate Risk Management  Since 1980, U.S. manufacturing firms have cut more than two million workers.  More than 85 percent of the Fortune 1000 firms downsized their white-collar work forces between 1987 and 1991.  The 1996 survey of the American Manufacturing Association reported that in the twelve months ending in June 1996, 49 percent of major U.S. companies eliminated jobs.  A decade ago, industry downsizers were chiefly failing companies who were responding to reductions in sales or shrinking business.  More recently, however, restructuring has involved successful firms engaged in a wide array of changes to realize broad corporate ends.  Corporations now seek to restructure the workplace, the workforce, and the production process to achieve the increased flexibility and efficiency required in a period of greater economic uncertainty, rapid technological change, and intense global competition.  But this restructuring has occurred just as corporations have been actively developing environmental and risk-management programs.  What have been the effects of restructuring on corporate environmental programs and capabilities?  Have such programs and capabilities been disproportionally affected vi-a-vis other corporate functions?  How have corporations adjusted to meet environmental and risk-management goals in a context of downsizing and outsourcing?  How successful have they been and are new corporate vulnerabilities in environmental and risk management surfacing?  This project analyzes these issues through an analysis of case studies have been conducted on corporations, am economic and statistical analysis of data from the Census Bureau's Center for Economic Studies, a survey of firms in the pulp and paper industry, and in-depth interviewing and document analysis at three selected firms.  An outstanding interdisciplinary team of researchers at Clark University's George Perkins Marsh Institute has been assembled to conduct the research, advised by a distinguished team of academic and industry representatives.",
