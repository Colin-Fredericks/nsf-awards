 "awd_abstract_narration": "Voxel-based volumetric objects normally have much more complex  physical properties and spatial structures than surface-based  geometric models.  Thus, traditional physically-based deformation  modeling techniques are often ineffective and costly in the  volumetric domain. This project will focus on developing  efficient and accurate modeling techniques, computational methods  and visualization algorithms for deformable volumetric objects.    A new landmark-based volume deformation model and related  rendering algorithms will be developed. In this model, a volume  deformation is represented by a relatively small set of landmark  points defined in a volume space. Three-dimensional scattered  data interpolation methods will be applied to generate smooth  deformation functions over the volume space. Landmark points and  their movements can be used for both the interactive deformation  manipulations and the deformation pattern representations of  specific types of deformable objects. Instead of directly  modeling the object's physical or biological properties, this  approach employs an inverse method to derive the deformation  pattern of a given class of objects, using a parameterized spring  model, directly from existing or experimental data. Fast  deformable volume rendering algorithms will also be developed to  support the visualization of the volume deformation process. To  avoid unnecessary deformation computation and multiple volume  resampling, the deformation computation will be integrated into  the rendering process without explicit volume reconstruction. For  region-specific deformations of different sub-structures in a  complex and hierarchical volumetric environment, deformation  operations can also be applied to a Volumetric-CSG model to  support deformable volumetric object manipulation. Several  applications of this research will be pursued, including  craniofacial growth, volume morphing, medical object modeling and  interactive volumetric animation.",
