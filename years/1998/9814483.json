 "awd_abstract_narration": "9814483 Ranjithan As industries move towards more environmentally responsible manufacturing practices, they are shifting from an emphasis on reduction of emissions in the manufacturing stage to a broader consideration of alternative products, product designs and product delivery systems to reduce material consumption as well as environmental impacts.  Another significant phase in the life cycle of a product is its fate when it enters the waste stream at the end of its useful life.  Established life cycle-based methods are available to estimate environmental burdens of both production and waste management phases; however, the two life-cycle phases are rarely combined and tools and methodologies to conduct an integrated analysis are lacking.  The primary focus of this research is to develop a systems approach that will facilitate integrated analysis of production and waste management processes and their combined environmental implications.  Specific objectives are to (1) develop a model, integrating a product life-cycle inventory (LCI) with a newly developed life-cycle model of waste management alternatives to examine how the combined LCIs are important and can be influential in product decision making, (2) demonstrate the applicability of the model for analyzing the net environmental benefits/burdens in the life-cycle of several products, including packaging products that constitute about 35 percent of the municipal waste stream in the U.S., (3) evaluate the combined environmental implications of alternative waste management policies and practices as they influence shifts in product design and production processes, and (4) incorporate the systems modeling approach and analytical framework in the education of future environmental practitioners in an integrated manner.  It is anticipated that this approach will be useful to both government policy makers and the product designers in industry charged with the development of strategies for the manufacture of products that minimize environmental impacts.  This grant is made pursuant to the joint NSF/Lucent Technologies Industrial Ecology Research Fellowships Program 1998.",
