 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glenn Evans is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to continue his formal theoretical   studies of elementary models for complex fluids consisting of micelles   and liquid crystals.  He will study both the static and dynamic   properties of these complex systems.  The static behavior studies will be   based on an extension of Stell's modification of Wertheim's theory.  The   goal of this work is to understand how micelles and cell membranes self   assemble.  The aim of the dynamical studies is to understand how micelles   coagulate or fracture when their dilute solutions are subjected to shear   flow.  The dynamical studies will be based on an adaptation of the theory   of nuclear collisions for soft condensed matter.  Results will be   compared with molecular dynamics simulations.  Amphiphiles are complex molecules.  They can behave as anionic, cationic,   zwitterionic and nonionic surfactants.  At the appropriate critical   concentration, they can self assemble into micelles such as those found   in common detergents.  When biologically significant amphiphiles such as   cholines self assemble to form monolayers, these layers constitute cell   walls.  Evans' research seeks to find a molecular based theory that will   elucidate the complex properties of amphiphiles, and that will ultimately   help us to determine how to design amphiphiles with desired chemical and   physical properties.",
