The\r\nfirst is focused in the investigations in developing and using\r\nnonlinear analysis of partial differential equations to study\r\nformations of singularities in various problems, arising from\r\ntheoretical physics mostly in differential geometrical settings,\r\nincluding harmonic maps, Yang-Mills-Higgs theory, harmonic map flows,\r\nand curvature driven flows.  The main approach is based on scaling\r\nmethods.  One problem that I am working on now is to understand some\r\nfiner structure of the compactified spaces of solutions (harmonic\r\nmaps).  This is an essential problem for one to understand the\r\nformation and nature of singularities.  The second part is the\r\ninvestigation of the interplay of geometry and analysis.  The central\r\nproblems are to understand the best constants in sharp Sobolev type\r\ninequalities in terms of the isoperimetric constants, and to\r\nunderstand how the local analytic quantities are related to the global\r\ngeometry even the topology.  One of the approach is to study the\r\nspectral theory of various natural differential operators associated\r\nwith the geometry, especially the conformally covariant geometric\r\ndifferential operators.\r\n\r\nThe formation and nature of singularities in nature are of enormous \r\ninterests to human beings.  The kind of singularities that will be \r\nstudied in the proposed project are particularly of great interests to \r\nthe material sciences and meteorology.  For instance, the formation \r\nand nature of singularities in Ginzburg-Landau problems as a \r\nparticular case of the Yang-Mills-Higgs theory was proposed to study \r\nsuper-conductivity and other super-fluids phenomena.  The effect of \r\nthe scale that one uses to describe the system turns out to be very \r\nimportant.  This explains that to understand anything that survives \r\nunder changes of scales is very crucial.  Therefore our main approach \r\nis based on the scaling methods.  The second research topics in the \r\nproposed project is basically aiming at developing and understanding \r\nsome mathematical tools that are expected to be essential for the \r\nfirst topics.  The proposed project is also closely tied with the \r\ngraduate program in the department of Mathematics at UCSC by a plan to \r\ngenerate research activities to the benefit of graduate student \r\ninterested in this area.\r\n",
