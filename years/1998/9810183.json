 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810183  Shalaev    This proposal is concerned with nonlinear near field optical  processes in fractal thin films, namely self-affine surfaces  and 2d random metal-dielectric films. Nonlinear optical  processes to be investigated include: Kerr-type nonlinear  refraction and absorption, nearly-degenerate four wave  mixing, and second and higher harmonic generation.  Collective optical excitations of fractal thin films lead to  \"hot\" spots which are separated in space by distances much  larger than the spot size. These spatially localized \"hot  spots\" represent the eigenmodes of a fractal film. Spatial  distributions of the local (near-field) nonlinear spectra on  a fractal thin film will be calculated. These spectra are  experimentally accessible by parking a tip of a photon  scanning tunneling microscope at different points on the  surface and varying the wavelength. Important information  are obtained about the local configurations of a fractal  film and the resonance frequencies of these nm-scale random  areas of the film. Phase and amplitude correlation  properties of the nonlinear fields generated from different  spots of a fractal film will be studied by analyzing the  statistics of the nonlinear near-zone fields, e.g., through  two-point correlation functions. %%% The PI's theoretical  research contributes to the development of a nonlinear  optical spectroscopy of single molecules and materials of  dimensions on the scale of molecules.  ***",
