 "awd_abstract_narration": "To understand brain function, we need to understand brain  structure.  The evolution of mammals has led to many differences  in brain anatomy, but we know very little how those differences  correlate to the wide diversity of animal behavior.  This  collaborative project is to consolidate and make more accessible  for research and education two major collections that form a  unique, extensive, remarkably preserved assembly of comparative  mammalian brain specimens.  Together they contain more than 275  sectioned and stained brains, including over a half million  microscope slides, representing over 150 species, from 50 Families  in 17 different Orders of Mammalia.  Many specimens are  irreplaceable, from rare or endangered species, and so can provide  critically unique data for questions about biodiversity.  The  collections are being brought to a national museum facility in  Washington DC to join complementary extensive human brain  collections, and so establish a single site for storage, curation,  and research on comparative mammalian brain neuroanatomy.  An  electronic/website also is being developed, including several  selected images, which researchers could access worldwide for  data, or use to evaluate whether to make a research visit to the  site itself to examine the original material.     The impact of this project is high.  First, it safely preserves  for future research an irreplaceable resource that also represents  a scientific investment of more than 50 years of exacting work by  dozens of people.  Second, it promotes multidisciplinary research  on comparative neuroscience, behavior, and systematics to  understand the diversity in the most complex organ known, adding  computational expertise for technological development of digital  imaging and multidimensional databases.  Third, it provides a  working base as well as a model for sharing complex morphological  data with other collections, such as those on non-mammalian  vertebrate brains.  Fourth, the project will have educati onal as  well as research impact by providing easy website access to  information about the vertebrate brain in the context of  biodiversity.",
