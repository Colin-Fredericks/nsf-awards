Noble  Affiliation:   University of Colorado, Boulder      This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.  The principal investigator is Dr. Richard Noble at the University of Colorado, Boulder.  The investigators propose to develop an understanding of the separation mechanisms involved in facilitated transport membranes.  The novel aspect of the research is the development of composite membranes where a fluorinated ion-exchange component is present within the pores of a porous hydrophobic component.   Sodium and/or silver are ion-exchanged onto these composite membrane and the separation of olefins from paraffin's will be tested.  The investigators characterize the interfacial transport along the ion exchange region of the polymer composite and determine its role in overall membrane flux and selectivity characteristics.    The separation of very similar chemical species that differ very slightly in molecular weight, is of tremendous importance to the chemical, petroleum processing and fine chemicals industries.  Traditional chemical processes such as distillation are not very effective.  Membranes hold promise for such separations but to be commercially feasible, significant advances in membrane design have to be made.  This research addresses composite membrane design for the separation of these species.  If successful, implementation would lead to significant cost savings to the chemicals and petoleum processing industries.",
