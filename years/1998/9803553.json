These spaces play an important role in various areas of mathematics,  including topology, algebraic geometry, geometric analysis, and quantum  field theory.  For example, in algebraic geometry these spaces have been  fruitfully explored in solving enumerative problems.  In this project,  the investigator is studying intersection numbers on the moduli spaces of  stable curves and stable maps.  He intends to use this study in order to  understand natural deformations of a certain class of cohomological field  theories.  The investigator is also studying the topology of moduli spaces  of stable maps, which are important in their own right.  Even a particular  case, the case of the moduli spaces of stable curves, has generated a  lot of interesting mathematics.       For the past decade, the interaction between mathematics and physics  has provided many beautiful, and sometimes unexpected, results and  conjectures.  In particular, geometry has incorporated many ideas and  much intuition from string theory in physics.  String theory treats  a particle as a small loop rather than a point.  When a particle moves  in time it traces out a surface.  Therefore understanding geometries on  surfaces, which has always been of interest to mathematicians, has also  become important in physics.  In this project, the investigator is studying  the spaces that incorporate information about all geometries on a given  surface.  He is also studying geometries on surfaces living inside a given  space.  For example, one can count the number of surfaces satisfying  certain constraints inside the given space.  Amazingly, the origin in  physics of this subject is topological gravity.    ***",
