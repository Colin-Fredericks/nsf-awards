 "awd_abstract_narration": "As the twenty-first century approaches, astronomy is enjoying a time of extraordinary advances that hold the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the physical universe. To offer students at Trinity University intensive hands-on experiences in astronomy during this remarkable period, we wish to acquire a set of modern telescopes and related equipment for the Marrs McLean Science Center, including a single computer-controlled, 16\" Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope, six computer-controlled, 8\" Schmidt-Cassegrain telescopes, and two CCD cameras. This new equipment will be such a dramatic improvement over our present facilities that we will be able to implement a well-defined, two-tier approach to the teaching of observational astronomy \"across the curriculum\" - primarily in introductory physics laboratory courses and astronomy classes, but ranging from first-year seminar courses to our most advanced experimental physics courses for majors - that may serve as a useful model for similar undergraduate institutions. First, students will discover how much they can learn about the universe by their own human powers of observation and estimation at the eyepiece of a telescope. Second, they will obtain CCD images of celestial objects and make rigorous, quantitative, research-quality measurements. The relatively modest cost of this acquisition would make it as common for Trinity students to do astronomy with telescopes as it already is for them to do biology with microscopes. The principal beneficiaries will be approximately 250 Trinity undergraduates (>10% of total enrollment) per year, of whom 50% are women and 20% minoritv students.",
