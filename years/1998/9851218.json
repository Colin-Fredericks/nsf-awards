 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will bring modern technology in gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) to science and non-science majors at Huntingdon College. Basic theory and demonstrations will be added to freshman-level chemistry courses. Hands-on use of the requested instrument will begin in the Organic laboratory, making experiences in analyzing molecular structure more representative of modern methods. Students will experience additional GC-MS methods, such as headspace sampling of flavors and fragrances and selected ion monitoring, in the Analytical/Environmental Chemistry course. The instrument will promote environmental and forensic applications (in collaboration with the state forensic science laboratory), making student laboratory experiences more exciting and interesting by connection to real-life situations. The quality and scope of undergraduate research and capstone projects will also improve. Students will use GC-MS in conjunction with FT-NMR and FTIR analysis, establishing further connections in learning how science is done and making them better prepared for graduate school and industrial employment in chemistry. The project will influence an outside audience with mini-course offerings and will serve as a model for other institutions similar to Huntingdon. The success of the project will be determined by student course evaluations, the number of majors taking undergraduate research projects, formal presentations, publications, and surveys. Dissemination will occur through presentations, publications in international chemistry research and chemistry education journals, the World-Wide Web, and interactions with educators at scientific meetings.",
