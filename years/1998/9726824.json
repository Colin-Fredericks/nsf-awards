 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726824   Crepet     Turonian (Upper Cretaceous) angiosperm flowers: structure, systematics and phylogenetic/evolutionary significance    The flowering plants (angiosperms) are the most economically important, ecologically diverse, and species rich plants on Earth today.  However, our understanding of the origins and early history of diversification of this important group has been hampered by a relatively poor fossil record and, especially,  few fossilized flowers, the source of the best characters for identification.  Previous studies by Drs. Crepet and Nixon uncovered an extraordinarily rich assemblage of angiosperm reproductive structures from early Upper Cretaceous (Turonian) localities in northern New Jersey, which may be the richest deposits of angiosperm floral remains.  Over 100 taxa have been discovered to date.  The age of the sites (90 MYBP) places them in the early history of major angiosperm radiations, and offers the potential to discover additional unusual and phylogenetically significant extinct forms.  Already these fossils provide a stunning array of floral innovations and are the oldest documented examples of numerous features such as sympetaly, magnoliid receptacular cups, apparent nectar-producing staminodia, various forms of stamen and anther modifications, and viscin threads.  The fact that these highly adaptive characters are represented in the same deposits as a rich insect fauna presents an unusual opportunity to infer modes pollination biology at a time when such relationships might have been significant in flowering plant success.  Because of the quality and detail of preservation, these fossils can be placed into phylogenetic perspective with the use cladistic analyses to select among hypotheses of relationships to modern flowering plant groups.  Analysis also will be used to test fossil reconstructions of disparate, unattached organs.  In addition, these studies will provide test cases for various aspects of cladistic theory such as the effect of missing data on an alyses and the significance of fossil mosaics (so-called missing links).  The techniques of scanning and transmission electron microscopy will be used, and the work will include and a significant amount of curation and databasing effort.  The project will provide a large amount of unique data that will be relevant to many other scientists including, particularly, angiosperm systematists and pollination biologists.  The analyses should move us one step closer to understanding angiosperm relationships, early diversification, and success.",
