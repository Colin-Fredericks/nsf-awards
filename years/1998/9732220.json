 "awd_abstract_narration": "The methodologies of computational geometry will be applied to  design, analyze, implement, and test algorithms for problems that  arise in application areas such as manufacturing, computer-aided  design, graphics and visualization, robotics, cartography, and  air traffic control.  An important aspect of the work is to  conduct technology dissemination to industry, helping to transfer  algorithms into practice.  This will be done through pursuit of  new industrial collaborations, while building on the several  industrial partnerships that have already been developed.  In  order to find applications of computational geometry to meet the  needs of industry, companies will be visited in order to discuss  their geometric computing needs, and  formulate their most critical problems as instances of  algorithmic questions.  Further, as solutions are proposed and  developed, the industrial partners will be assisted with the  implementation and integration phases of the projects.    The specific repertoire of problems includes: (a) manufacturing  process planning (NC verification, tool path generation,  deposition, cutting, bending) and virtual manufacturing  (collision detection, assembly planning); (b) computer graphics  and visualization (rendering large polygonal models, volume  visualization, visibility preprocessing, texture mapping); (c)  Geographic Information Systems (GIS), including map  generalization and optimal route planning in geometric  environments under a variety of constraints and objectives  (air traffic management, transshipment, mobile robotics, military  mission planning).",
