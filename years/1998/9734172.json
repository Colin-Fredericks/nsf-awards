Examples include routing trucks, trains and buses in transportation and distribution networks, designing fiber-optic telecommunication networks for the transmission of voice, data, audio and video, planning and scheduling industrial machines in factories and scheduling crews in airlines.  Each of these problems can be formulated mathematically as mixed-integer programs, namely, an optimization problem with a linear objective function in decision variables that are required to be either continuous or integer and which must satisfy a finite set of linear constraints. This particular class of problems is of enormous relevance in the area of Management Science and Operations Research, not only because of its wide applicability to real industrial problems, but also because their efficient solution has challenged researchers for the past fifty years. In spite of important breakthroughs in the design of efficient algorithms and computer technology, practitioners continue to formulate mixed-integer programming problems that cannot be solved adequately with existing algorithms. This research will focus on two general methodologies: approximate solution procedures and  exact algorithms. The approximate procedures are designed to obtain near-optimal solutions with a measure of the amount the solution deviates from optimality for very-large scale problems. The exact algorithm is a robust mixed-integer programming solver based on a branch-and-cut algorithm that uses disjunctive cutting planes.  The results of this research will be implemented into a software package that will be made available to the large community of users. The software development will be performed in a flexible computer environment, allowing for runs on networks of  computers. Consequently, implemented algorithms will efficiently solve large-scale mixed-integer probl ems without any particular mathematical structure. Moreover, the new theoretical developments will provide a foundation for determining general mathematical properties of these problems.  The new theory should allow for further development of increasingly efficient algorithms.  ***",
