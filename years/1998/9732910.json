 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harold Friedman and Fernando Raineri are supported by a grant from the   Theoretical and Computational Chemistry Program to use a combination of   integral equation techniques and molecular dynamics simulations to   understand the structural, energetic and dynamical aspects of the   solvation of complex molecules in a variety of solvent environments.    They have developed a Surrogate Hamiltonian theory that employs a   renormalized linear response theory for the nonequilibrium distribution   function of the solvent in the time-varying field of the solute.   The   theory has been applied to number of simpler systems and checked with   molecular dynamics simulations.  In the next phase of the research,   particular emphasis will be placed on electron transfer reactions and   bond-breaking / bond-forming reactions.  The surrogate Hamiltonian theory   will be extended to include higher order effects such as multiple   moments, solute excluded volume and hydrogen bonding effects.  They also   plan to develop a molecular interpretation for the parameters used by   physical organic chemists to quantify nucleophilic solvent assistance in   the solvolysis of aliphatic halides in solution.  The aim of this research project is to improve the way in which   measurable properties of solutions are interpreted in terms of the   interactions among the molecular constituents. This is particularly   challenging for ionic solutions since the long range of the forces   between the ionic charges strongly affect both the measurable properties   and the mathematical tools needed to relate them to the molecular models.    The work of Friedman and Raineri should provide fundamental molecular   insight into the mechanism and dynamics of solvation.",
