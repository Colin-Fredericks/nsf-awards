 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal No.: 9732073  PI:  Miaoulis  University: Tufts University      ABSTRACT    The success of materials processing and manufacturing is strongly influenced by thermal and fluid phenomena.  Unfortunately, most processing engineers are trained in only a single discipline and lack sufficient knowledge about thermal/fluid effects in the process.  In response, Tufts University established the Thermal Analysis of Materials Processing Laboratory (TAMPL) to conduct interdisciplinary research including thermavfluid sciences, materials science, and manufacturing.  This laboratory has proven to be a successful place to educate engineers in interdisciplinary research that is relevant to industry.  TAMPL is a unique research setting that involves a chain of mentorships from faculty to graduate students to undergraduates to high school girls.  This aim of the proposed project is to expand the research opportunities to undergraduate engineers from colleges and universities where settings such as TAMPL are not available.  Also, TAMPL has a strong commitment and record to increasing the number of women in engineering careers.  Recruitment will be aimed at non-research institutions (as categorized by the Carnegie Classification) and limited-research institutions in order to provide them with an experience at Tufts, a research university.  Based on our experience with Tufts undergraduates, such experience will encourage them to continue with their graduate studies in engineering.  Projects include examining heat transfer in thermal processing of electronic materials, fluid flow in turbulent mixing processes, and process control in thermal manufacturing systems.  The P.I.'s and a trained team of graduate students will lead the undergraduates through an introduction to the research process, project supervision, internet publishing workshops, and presentation skills.  Combining these skills with the interdisciplinary nature and extensive resources of TAMPL will give these students a unique undergraduate experien ce that will encourage them to continue with their engineering education.",
