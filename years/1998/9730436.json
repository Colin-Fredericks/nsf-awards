 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, which is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and   Organometallic Chemistry Program, Dr. David R. Tyler of the Department of   Chemistry, University of Oregon, will continue his studies on   organometallic radical reactivity.  The first part of the project   involves using time-resolved pump/probe spectroscopy and `slow` kinetic   methods to measure the cage effect for a series of photochemically and   thermally generated organometallic radicals, including substituted   cyclopentadienyl compounds of Mo, titanocenes, and cobaloximes.  The cage   effect refers to the phenomenon that the probability of combination of a   radical pair is greater in solution than in the gas phase.  Cage effects   are necessary to explain kinetic observations and fundamental reaction   phenomena for chemical reactivity in solution in all areas of chemistry   and biochemistry.  Experiments will probe the effect of radical size,   shape, and mass on the cage effect.  The concepts of `microscopic   inertia` and solvent `microviscosity` will be probed as they relate to   the cage effect.  Radicals with long chains will also be examined as   these are directly relevant to polymer and bio-chemistry.  The goal of   this research is to acquire a predictive understanding of the cage   effect.  The second part of this project will focus on studies of the   reactivity of water soluble organometallic radical species in aqueous   solution.  Substitution reactions of photochemically and   electrochemically generated 17-electron species will be studied, as will   oxidatively-induced migratory insertion reactions.  The kinetics and   activation parameters of these reactions will be determined by infrared   spectroscopy and chronocoulometry experiments, with the goal of   determining reaction mechanisms.  Electron-transfer-chain reactions   catalyzed by organometallic radicals will also be studied with an   emphasis on determining the differences in radical reactivity between   aqueous and nonaqueous solutions.  Several new water soluble phosphine   ligands will also be synthesized and tested in biphasic hydroformylation   and hydrogenation catalysis experiments using Rh complexes.    This project will provide useful and fundamentally important information   on the nature of reactions in solution that involve radicals, reactive   chemical compounds with an odd number of electrons.  Radical reactions   are ubiquitous in chemistry and biochemistry and include polymerization   reactions (plastics and fibers) and life sustaining enzyme reactions.    Results of the work with water soluble organometallic catalysts will be   fundamental and practical.  Most chemicals produced in industry involve   catalysis and many processes use volatile and toxic organic solvents.    There are compelling environmental reasons to develop catalysts that can   use water as a solvent.",
