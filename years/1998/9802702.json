Weida, postdoctoral fellow, Indiana University, for  collaboration  with Dr. Hrvoje Petek, Senior Research  Scientist,  Hitachi  Advanced Research Laboratory, Hatoyama, Saitama,  Japan.  These collaborators will perform a detailed study of the reaction  kinetics  and  mechanisms for the reduction  of  a  copper  oxide  surface by hydrogen atoms.  Copper can be viewed as a good  model  for  more complicated transition metals.  This suggests that  the  oxygen-hydrogen  reaction on copper, as a  model  system,  should  provide  new  insight into heterogeneous catalysis on  transition  metals.    Although  the  study  of catalytically useful  transition  metals  stems  in  part  from their practical importance,  the  study  of  hydrogen  and  oxygen on copper surfaces has  several  advantages  which make it a system of fundamental interest.  One advantage is  the  fact  that  the  adsorbate structures  of  both  oxygen  and  hydrogen  on  copper have been extensively characterized.   Given  the  level  of  understanding of the  adsorption  of  oxygen  and  hydrogen  on  copper surfaces, it seems natural to  extend  these  studies  to the interaction of these species on copper  surfaces.  This  research may shed light on such topics of current  interest  as  self  organization of adsorbates on surfaces  and  adsorbate-  induced  metal  atom transport in heterogeneous catalysis.   This  project is supported under the Science Fellowship Program between  the  National Science Foundation and the Japan Foundation  Center  for Global Partnership.  ***",
