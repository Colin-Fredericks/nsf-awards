 "awd_abstract_narration": "ROHLF  9800636         Landmark-based geometric morphometrics is an approach to the study of  shape of organisms in which one analyzes the Cartesian coordinates of  homologous landmarks. They can be applied to two- and three-dimensional  coordinates, and allow both a description of within- and between-group  variability, and a visualization of the variation in a manner that allows a  more meaningful biological interpretation.     The proposed research has two main goals. The first is to develop and  statistically evaluate methods to analyze landmark data from articulated  structures. Three new methods will be developed, and tests based on each  will be statistically evaluated through computer simulation studies  designed to quantify their type I error rates and relative powers. These  simulations will be performed using a variety of artificial data sets with  various covariance structures in an attempt to determine whether one method  is superior for expected data types, or which method is best suited for  particular types of data. The second goal is to apply these techniques to a  data set containing landmarks from skulls and mandibles of two species of  plethodontid salamanders from sympatric and allopatric localities, to gain  understanding of the relationship between trophic ecology and morphological  variation in these species.",
