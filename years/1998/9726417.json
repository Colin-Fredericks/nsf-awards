The combination of climate and fisheries records will be used to determine possible impacts of climate-induced changes in cod fisheries on human populations. Of particular importance will be an examination of the societal response to climate change and fisheries abundance during two of the most dramatic climate events to occur in the North Atlantic region during recorded history, the \"Little Ice Age\" and the \"Medieval Warm Period\".  The research will involve an interdisciplinary approach in which physical, climate, historical, and sociological evidence is gathered to examine effects of significant changes in the environment on human populations that depend on resources controlled in part by climate-driven systems.  Therefore, the project will make a significant contribution to the determination of the human dimensions of global change in the North Atlantic during two periods of significant climate fluctuations.",
