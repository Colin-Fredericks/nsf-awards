Specific aims are to:  (1) develop a novel imaging methodology to quantitatively  investigate topological and bulk microstructure of 3-D  biodegradable porous tissue analogs under physiological  conditions; (2) design novel microstructural configurations  of polymeric matrices that promote the phenotype and  functions of cultured liver cells; and (3) examine the  effect of polymer degradation on the topological and bulk  matrix microstructure and the local physico-chemical  conditions to the physiology of liver cells.  For the  teaching component of this award, the specific aims are to:  (1) develop an innovative university-wide curriculum in  Tissue Engineering which reflects a focus on biomaterials  engineering; (2) establish a new course for students from  regional high schools with the goal of offering to selected  students a broad study of bioengineering as a field  combining life sciences with the physical sciences and  mathematics; and (3) extend outreach to other universities  and high schools by distance instruction through an internet-  based network.  ***",
