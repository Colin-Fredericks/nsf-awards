The theory\r\nhas potential for significant advances in the study of two-dimensional\r\nsystems of physical interest.  Among the most interesting and important\r\ncome from fluid mechanics.  Dr. Boyland will use Thurston-Nielsen\r\ntheory in conjunction with other dynamical tools to obtain a deeper\r\nunderstanding of two-dimensional fluid mixing.  Various mathematical\r\nextensions of the Thurston-Nielsen theory will be obtained.  These\r\nextensions would enhance the applicability of the theory as well as\r\nbeing of intrinsic mathematical interest.  In addition, numerical and\r\nlaboratory experiments are proposed with the goal of designing\r\neffective mixers and understanding many vortices as a model for\r\ntwo-dimensional turbulence.\r\n\r\nThe mixing of different species of materials is extremely common in\r\nnatural systems and industrial applications.  The main scientific\r\nquestion is to understand how the mixing takes place, while in\r\nindustrial applications the focus is usually on the development of\r\nschemes for effective mixing.  In many applications high viscosity,\r\nsensitivity of materials, the need to avoid foaming, and other\r\nconstraints make turbulence mixing infeasible and undesirable.  Thus in\r\nmost instances the design of useful mixing procedures requires close\r\nattention to efficiency.  The added mathematical understanding made\r\npossible by this project should help in this design process, providing\r\nnovel ideas for efficient mixing procedures and helping to eliminate\r\ninefficient ones prior to expensive experimentation. In addition, this\r\nproject will make a powerful body of pure mathematics more accessible\r\nfor application to problems of physical and industrial importance.\r\n",
