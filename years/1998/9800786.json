 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nSolomyak\r\n     \r\nThe goal of this project is to investigate self-similar measures \r\nand sets, self-affine sets, and attractors of non-linear iterated \r\nfunction systems. The main emphasis is on the \"overlapping\" case \r\nwhen the symbolic coding is non-unique, and the closely related \r\nhigher-dimensional non-conformal case. Hyperbolic and parabolic \r\nsystems will be considered. The topics include\r\ndimension computation, the study of topological properties of \r\nattractors, and smoothness properties of natural measures on them. \r\nThe methods of symbolic dynamics and ergodic theory, number theory \r\nand geometric measure theory, harmonic and complex analysis will \r\nbe used.\r\n     \r\nDynamical systems describe a wide range of phenomena,\r\nsuch as the motion of planets and asteroids, the rise and fall of \r\npopulations, the weather, and the stock market. Many of these \r\nsystems exhibit \"chaotic\" behavior and have \"attractors\" of \r\nintricate shapes and structure. This structure can often be \r\nexplained by an underlying \"self-similarity\" which means that\r\nthe object looks similar at all scales. The \"fractal dimension\" \r\nof the attractor is one of the basic characteristics which can \r\nbe used to distinguish systems of different nature.\r\nTopological properties, such as connectedness and presence of \r\nthe interior are also very important. We are still very\r\nfar from complete understanding of these complex objects, and this \r\nstudy aims to investigate them in a number of model cases. \r\nMoreover, the theory developed for this is relevant in\r\nother areas, such as computer image recognition.\r\n     \r\n    \r\n",
