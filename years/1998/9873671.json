 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds an NSF Research Planning Workshop on Self-reconfiguring Robots, to be held in the   Fall of 1998 at the Minary Center, New Hampshire.  The workshop will investigate the scientific and   engineering challenges in building and using self-reconfiguring robots to increase the flexibility of  robot systems.  Self-reconfiguring robots consist of a set of identical modules that can dynamically and   autonomously reconfigure in a variety of shapes, to best fit the terrain the robot has to navigate, the shape   of the object the robt has to manipulate, or the sensing needs of the task.  A modular robotic structure that   can metamorphose into a different geometric structure by reorganizing internally its modules supports  multiple modalities of navigation, manipulation, and sensing.  Self-reconfiguration provides a paradigm   shift for studying the fundamental principles of organization and reorganization in physical systems. In  robotics, self-reconfiguration defines a rich class of questions about designing, controlling, and using   massively distributed systems of robots.  The scientific foundations of self-reconfiguring robotics are only  beginning to emerge.  Progress in this field will be enabled by advances in mechanical design, distributed   systems, and planning.  The workshop on self-reconfiguring robotics will bring together leading  experts in this field to discuss the current state of the field and to set short term and long term research   goals. A summary of the discussion will be provided as a Web site and as a Dartmouth computer  science technical report.",
