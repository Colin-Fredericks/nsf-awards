 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726539  VanLandingham    This award supports the participation of American scientists  and engineers in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Intelligent  Distributed Autonomous Power Systems, to be held in Hakone,  Japan from July 12-18, l998.  The co-organizers are  Professors Hugh VanLandingham of Virginia Polytechnic  Institute and Osami Tsukamoto of Yokohama National  University in Japan.  The seminar will focus on: (a)  distributed intelligence which includes sensing,  forecasting, telecommunications, computers and control; (b)  DC and dual-frequency AC bus technology; (c) demand side  management, time of use pricing; (d) renewable energy,  photovoltaics; (e) electric vehicles, battery and other  storage devices; (f) load forecasting; (g) fuel cells,  microturbines; (h) building energy efficiency; and  environmental impact assessment.    Power systems of the future will have different requirements  due to customer choice and concerns about environmental  degradation resulting from the generation and consumption of  electricity.  Their choice may be based on a demand for high  quality delivered with a high degree of reliability,  environmental concerns and costs.  In order to study the  feasibility and functioning of such distributed utilities of  the future, the concept of Intelligent Distributed  Autonomous Power System is proposed.  It will be composed of  several autonomous power systems that are loosely connected.  These units will be responsible for their own load and  supply of electricity, but can and will depend on outside  sources for their normal operations.  These systems will  typically be small and will serve small towns or parts of  large cities.  The topics identified need to be explored to  understand the set-up and performance of these Intelligent  Systems.  The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese  experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to  advance their own work, and will set the stage for future  collaborative projects.  Seminar organizers have made a  special effor t to involve postdoctoral researchers.  The  proceedings of the meeting are expected to be made available  on both universities' Web pages.  ***",
