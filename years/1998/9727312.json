 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program supports research by Dr. David N. Hendrickson of the Chemistry   Department, University of California at San Diego, on lattice dynamics   and bistability of electronically labile complexes.  Detailed studies   will be carried out on transition metal complexes that have two or more   electronic states that are close in energy.  For compounds in which   vibrational modes are closely coupled with electronic modes, changes in   crystal lattice parameters such as those caused by modifying solvent or   counter ions can result in spin-crossover or phase transitions in   response to changes in light or other external parameters.  A primary   goal of this project is to characterize magnetic bistability in    molecular species. Specifically the magnetic behavior of a series of   dodecamanganese-oxo-carboxylate complexes will be probed to characterize   the factors affecting the potential-energy barrier and the mechanism of   resonant magnetization tunneling in these single-molecule magnets   compounds. Investigation of photoinduced valence tautomerization in   cobalt complexes and spin crossover in opically sensitive iron complexes   will continue.  Methods will then be sought to attach these species to a   functionalized surface or polymer.      The long-term goal of this project is to develop molecules or collections   of molecules for use in electronic circuits and devices. In this   research, compounds containing a small number of metal atoms will be   tested for sensitivity and specificity of response to external physical   stimuli. Only a few examples of molecules in which the magnetic field   changes in response to changes in external magnetic field are known.  In   this investigation additional examples will be prepared and the factors   that control their behavior will be determined. These results can lead to   nanoscale devices which change spin, number of electrons, or magnetic   properties in response to electric, magnetic, optical, or thermal   changes. Many applications as switches or for information storage can be   envisioned. In addition to the scientific content, an important aspect of   this project is the training of young scientists.",
