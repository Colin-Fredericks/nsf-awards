Dr.  Payne will work with Dr. Akihisa Matsuda, Director, Thin  Film Silicon Solar Cells Super Lab, on a research project  entitled, \"Rapid Growth of Microcrystalline Silicon for Thin  Film Silicon Solar Cells.\"    The proposed research project will focus on two aspects:  (1) further investigations of dichlorosilane as a new source  gas, as well as looking at different ways to increase the  deposition rate of Microcrystalline silicon (uc-Si), and (2)  applying a method for improving hole mobility to a-SiGe:H  films and solar cells.  It is believed that fossil fuels  lead to dramatic changes in the global climate.  Also, use  of coal and petroleum-based liquid fuels is causing massive  degradation in local air quality.  Photovoltaic cells have  the potential to become a good substitute for the above  fuels.  Although the bulk of their demand is being met by  single crystalline and polycrystalline silicon cells, thin-  film solar cells will dominate the future of photovoltaics.  Microcrystalline silicon (uc-Si) shows increased  conductivity compared with a-Si:H, but it does not absorb  light as well.  The deposition rate of uc-Si is lower than a-  Si:H so the thicker layers required to absorb sunlight take  even longer to deposit.  The research will focus on  improvements necessary to incorporate uc-Si as the absorbing  layer of a solar cell in order to increase its deposition  rate as much as possible.  ***",
