 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this research is the development and implementation\r\nof effective numerical methods for the solution of partial differential \r\nequations which model the nonlinear mechanics of solids.  The principal \r\ninvestigator will use numerical methods to study quasilinear\r\npartial differential equations governing large motions of nonlinearly \r\nelastic, elastoplastic and viscoplastic materials.  \r\nThe equations governing the motions of such materials are generally \r\nsystems of hyperbolic conservation laws which are ideally suited for \r\nnumerical study. In particular, the PI will utilize an efficient numerical \r\nscheme based on finite-difference approximations and inspired by numerical \r\nmethods from gas dynamics in order to study antiplane and radial motions \r\nof elastoplastic materials, with the goal of characterizing the formation of shocks. \r\nAdditional effort will be directed toward the study of the formation of \r\nshear bands in viscoplastic materials.  The principal investigator will \r\nstudy the effects of strain-gradient regularization on the development \r\nand propagation of shear bands in two-dimensional nonlinear viscoplasticity.  \r\nThis will include studies of problems where the solutions exhibit \r\nnarrow shear bands, across which rapid variations in strain occur.  \r\nThe PI will develop adaptive pseudo-spectral methods to resolve spatial \r\nregions where rapid variations occur during plastic deformation.\r\n\r\nThe behavior of materials such as rubber, steel, or concrete can be\r\ndescribed by complicated systems of partial differential equations which are\r\nin general difficult to analyze.  However, there are certain special \r\nsituations in which these equations simplify to a point where they can be both\r\nanalyzed theoretically and computed numerically.  Examples include \r\nthe motion of a material block between a fixed and a moving plane and\r\nthe compression of a solid ball of material.  As a focus of this project, \r\nthe principal investigator will investigate the nature of shock formation \r\nand of permanent plastic deformation on the formation and propagation \r\nof shocks for these types of motions.  A second area of research is the \r\nformation of shear bands.  These are localized regions of intense shear \r\nthat form when ductile solids undergo large deformations.  Shocks \r\nand shear bands correspond to possible regions in which material failure occurs,\r\nand their accurate determination is therefore very important.  The principal\r\ninvestigator will take advantage of the special form of the equations to\r\napply high-performance numerical methods that have been developed for \r\napplications in gas dynamics. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
