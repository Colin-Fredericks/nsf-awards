 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the proposed project is to introduce a graphical dynamics simulation component using multibody software packages to the dynamics and control curriculum in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department at Cornell University, and to develop a new undergraduate course which explores the interplay between system identification, multibody simulation, and experimentation in the control design process. This will be achieved by purchasing and constructing four experimental platforms, and interfacing them to high-end Windows based PCs equipped with various software packages for data acquisition, system identification, control design and analysis, dynamical simulation, and real-time control. Due to the great advances in computing power, simulation has become an integral part of most engineering disciplines. This is certainly true for the design of high-performance control systems. For many control applications, the design cycle consists of obtaining high fidelity models of the system to be controlled, performing a control design based on reduced order models (for example), verifying the control design on the simulation model, altering the design until the required level of performance is achieved, and then testing out the design on the physical system. If the required level of performance is not achieved, this cycle is repeated. It should be stressed, however, that simulation is only a tool in the design process, and that extensive experimental verification should always be the end result of the design process; the real world is simply too complex to be fully simulated. Thus, an important goal in engineering education is to expose the students to the obvious advantages of simulation, but at the same time to make strong connections between computer simulations and the real devices which are being simulated.",
