IBN-9808705    Funds are requested for partial support of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Society for Developmental Biology, to be held at Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, June 20-25, 1998.  Dr. Scott is requesting partial support of the expenses for the invited plenary and symposia speakers, as well as partial support of the travel expenses for undergraduate, graduate and early postdoctoral students who will be presenting their work at poster sessions. The meeting will have about 800 registrants and will provide opportunities to hear the latest work from international leaders in the field, as well as from younger scientists whose work will be chosen from the abstracts for oral presentation. There will be two large poster sessions, each for two days, allowing everyone a chance to present their work to a richly diverse audience. The topics of the plenary sessions have been chosen to represent some of the most exciting areas of current developmental biology research, including early development, signaling systems, neural development and patterning, and cell guidance systems. Symposia topics are far ranging: organogenesis, signal transduction, coordination and maintenance of gene regulation, cell biology of development, axial patterning, development and evolution, eye development, medicine and development, morphogenesis, and homeobox gene function and evolution. Work with plants, animals, bacteria, and fungi will be included, and multidisciplinary approaches will be emphasized, including connections with human biology. Continuing the success of issue-oriented workshops at recent SDB annual meetings, we will hold workshops on education, ethics, and applications of computers and imaging technology, funding and future directions in science.",
