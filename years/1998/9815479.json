 "awd_abstract_narration": "Roberts  IBN 9815479    Steroid hormones are integral modulators of neural  communication and development.  These simple molecules,  acting as hormones, have the potential to influence all  neural functions from initiation of neural development to  the activity of individual synapses in adults.  Recent  advances in knowledge about non-genomic actions of steroid  hormones, the interactions with glial cells, and the role of  steroid hormones on neural organization, have had striking  effects on neuroendocrine physiology, neuronal cell biology,  reproductive physiology and non-reproductive behaviors such  as learning and memory, aging, aggression, social context,  feeding, and emotion.  This action will provide support for  a Young Investigator Symposium to be held at the 1997, 1998,  1998, and 1999 Workshop on Steroid Hormone and Brain  Function.  This workshop brings together scientists of  varied scientific background and perspectives in order to  integrate aspects of molecular biology, anatomy, physiology,  and behavior within a single session focused on an important  and timely issue concerning steroid hormones and brain  function.  Topics have ranged from extranuclear steroid  hormone receptors to a comparative approach to sexual  differentiation to steroid modulation of neuronal survival.  Each year, new symposia are presented on interdisciplinary  topic in a field that is rapidly changing and advancing.  The inclusion of the Young Investigator Symposium provides a  mechanism to ensure the strong participation of beginning  scientist, to recognize their achievements and potential,  and to facilitate collaborative efforts that may  significantly enhance our understanding of fundamental  neurobiological mechanisms.",
