 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the need for accurate friction process  models during all operating conditions of a machine for friction-  based diagnostics and motion control. Slow or sudden changes in  friction characteristics due to wear, temperature, humidity,  lubricant conditions, and loads can lead to undetected changes in  the parameters of a governing friction process model. For model-  based diagnostics, accurate friction process models are required  to detect faults that may lead to machine failure. For motion  control, friction process model uncertainty must be minimized to  maximize performance. This research develops estimation methods  for mechanical systems with nonstationary sliding or rolling  friction to detect and compensate for changes in friction process  models. To accomplish this, a synergistic combination of non-  model-based and model-based estimation is developed to separate  friction force observation from friction process model  identification. For friction force observation, nonlinear  estimators that do not require a structured friction model or  direct measurement of friction force will be developed. Friction  observers will use models of the physical system (apart from the  friction model) and measured motion to estimate friction force  through state extended filtering. Friction force observation will  supply inputs for model-based, multiple-model estimation to  identify a physically relevant friction model using Bayesian  selection. Experiments combining estimation and control will  focus on maximizing accuracy of high-speed, repetitive, motion  control for diverse applications such as semiconductor  manufacturing, positioning hard disk read/write heads, and  machine tool position/velocity control. Use of the estimation  methods to enhance friction based diagnostics will be  demonstrated by simulation in the context of model-based  condition monitoring of bearings.",
