 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project a new control-theoretic framework will be developed for\r\nrate-based robust flow controller design for high-speed networks, and the\r\nalgorithms derived from this framework will be adapted for implementation in\r\nATM networks and in the Internet. For this purpose the PIs will collaborate\r\nto investigate specific issues arising in their areas of expertise: ATM and\r\nInternet flow control, and robust control of infinite dimensional systems.\r\n>\r\n>The mathematical models to be considered in this project are systems with\r\ntime-varying time-delays.  For this class of systems, controller-design\r\nmethods will be developed by investigating several different approaches from\r\nH-infinity control, Mu-synthesis, gain scheduling for linear parameter\r\nvarying systems, and Lyapunov stability theory.  In particular, existing\r\ngain scheduling techniques for finite dimensional linear parameter varying\r\nsystems will be extended to time delay systems.\r\n>\r\n>Controllers derived in this framework will be validated by comparing them\r\nwith the existing controllers designed for ATM traffic management. New flow\r\ncontrollers will also be implemented and tested experimentally. First they\r\nwill be translated into algorithms to be implemented at the network-layer\r\n(switches and routers) within the scope of existing standards.  Both\r\nconnection-oriented networks (e.g. ATM networks) and connectionless networks\r\n(e.g. IP based Internet) will be considered in the project.  In the Internet\r\ndomain, techniques used will include writing into TCP windows, controlling\r\nthe rate of acknowledgements, writing into the ECN bit in the IP layer, and\r\ndeveloping a feedback framework in the Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS)\r\narchitecture.  Towards this goal, new techniques will be developed to\r\ntranslate rate-based control solutions into window-based control solutions\r\n(especially for applicability in Internet traffic management).\r\n>\r\n>The algorithm design will be followed by a performance evaluation using\r\nsimulation and experimentation to assess the impact of these methods on\r\nbest-effort services offered to networked multimedia applications.\r\nExperimental techniques will be used to determine traffic models, and\r\nnetwork measures of application quality, which will be used in simulation\r\nstudies of these algorithms in representative network configurations.\r\n>\r\n",
