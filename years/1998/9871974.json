 "awd_abstract_narration": "9871974  Nichols  Construction of High-Speed Research Network in Nevada   The University and Community College System of Nevada  (UCCSN), in conjunction with its three major research  institutions, will develop the Nevada Research Network  (NRN). This network will support a number of scientific  research applications that require high bandwidth and  quality of service features. The NRN is specified as an in-  state research-only network based on ATM over OC3 (fiber  optic) which will serve the University of Nevada, Las Vegas  (UNLV), the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), and the Las  Vegas and Reno campuses of the Desert Research Institute  (DRI). Five facilities and thirteen departments of these  three institutions will be connected initially to the NRN.  This high-speed connectivity will also provide the  researchers at these three Internet 2 institutions with the  opportunity to take full advantage of the National  Supercomputing Alliance with EPSCoR states. The design of  the NRN will provide for the cost-effective use of one or  more very-high-speed backbone network system connections.  The NRN consists of star topology network OC3 connections  originating at the Reno and Las Vegas offices of the UCCSN s  Systems Computing Services. Existing network infrastructures  and Internet Protocol distribution systems of the three  institutions and UCCSN supply service to designated  departments. An OC3 line between the two SCS offices  provides a north-south state backbone. An advisory  committee, consisting of representatives from each of the  participating organizations, will oversee implementation and  will be responsible for developing NRN access and use  policies.",
