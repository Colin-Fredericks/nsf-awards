 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of the Chemistry Division, Wodtke will develop his new experimental   method, studying quantum-state specific neutral time-of-flight (QSSnTOF),   to measure simultaneously the internal and translational energy of   photochemical reaction products.  Work on ketene will be continued at a   number of new photolysis wavelengths in order to show the validity of   Restricted Phase Space Theory (RPST), which had been developed to fit the   previously acquired data.  Additional experiments are proposed on BH3CO,   a simple Lewis acid:Lewis base complex that exhibits many bonding   characteristics of metal carbonyls.  The QSSnTOF method will be applied   to other species, such as O (singlet D) and NH (X triplet sigma minus) in   order to help unravel channels in ozone and HNCO photolysis.  %%%  Photodissociation, the process in which molecules fall apart as a result   of absorbing light, is one of the most basic of chemical processes.    These studies of Prof. Wodtke will examine in a very detailed way what   happens to the fragments of molecules which dissociate after absorbing   light.  The results will be analyzed and compared with theoretical models   in order to test the ranges of their validity.  Such studies have   wide-ranging impact, particularly in understanding reactions occurring in   the earth's atmosphere, but also on such processes as take place in   photochemical reactions anywhere, such as in the manufacturing or   environmental degradation of materials.                                                   \u00c1>\u2524\u00a2",
