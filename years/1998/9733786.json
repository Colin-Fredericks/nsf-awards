 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733786    Patten      Nanoclusters have garnered much interest due to their unique size-  dependent properties and, consequently, their potential for  technological applications.  The next important step in  exploiting the properties of nanoclusters is their incorporation  into and ordering within film-forming materials.  The principal  investigator will study methods to prepare well-defined hybrid  inorganic / organic nanoparticles in which the cores are  (semi)metal oxide nanoclusters and the exterior layers are vinyl  polymers, such as polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate) and  poly(methyl acry ate).  In particular, silica, will be studied  for the purposes of methods development, and then these methods  will be applied to other (semi)metal oxide nanoclusters  exhibiting magnetic and optical properties.  This project will  initially investigate methods to attach initiators for living  radical polymerizations to the surfaces of the nanoclusters and  then use these surface-modified nanoclusters as initiators for  such polymerizations.  The anticipated product material will be a  nanocluster core with well-defined polymer chains grafted from  the surface.  Because living polymerizations will be used to  graft the polymer chains, the structure and composition of the  polymer arms become a tool to investigate methods for ordering  the nanoclusters within the polymer film.  The principal  investigator will therefore develop methods for the end-  functionalization of polymers prepared using living radical  polymerizations.  One proposed method involves the block  copolymerization of vinyl monomers with cyclic ketene acetals  followed by hydrolysis to yield carboxylic acid-terminated  polymers.  These end-functionalization methods will be used to  place a variety of functional groups at the surface chain ends of  the nanocluster star polymers.  The grafting of block copolymers  from the surfaces of nanoclusters will also be studied.  The  microphase separation behavior of the resulting starblock  c opolymers will be exarnined to determine whether nanoclusters  can be ordered within polymer films using this strategy.  %%%  The principal investigator will integrate these research efforts  with the educational goal of incorporating polymer science into  the chemistry curriculum at UC Davis.  Because most of the major  US chemical producers have significant business efforts in  polymers and polymeric materials, chemistry students have a high  probability of moving into careers in polymer research,  development and manufacturing.  Thus, the addition of this  subject to the curriculum will provide students with valuable  training and skills that will enhance their employment prospects  in an increasingly competitive chemistry job market.  ***",
