 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  9870839  Graber        This research is aimed at determining how various receptors  activate specific G proteins. G proteins are  coupled to a  number of hormone and neurotransmitter receptors, and they  consist of 3 subunits: alpha, beta and gamma. The subunit  determines the type of reaction that will occur.  The  research here is attempting to identify the residues and  regions on the alpha subunits that interact with the 5HT1  and muscarinc receptors.  Amino acids in a region which is  required for coupling to the 5-HT receptors will be mutated  and  then functional assays of the receptor binding will be  performed. Truncation of the alpha 1 subunit will also be  examined to determine the minimal residues involved in the  coupling. Similar studies will be done with the muscarinc  receptors and the  alpha q subunits.  Other experiments will  be done to see if physical interactions occur in the absence  of function. These studies will aid in our understanding of  how many different receptors interact with G proteins to  result in different biological activities.    Heterotrimeric G proteins interact with a number of  different hormone and neurotransmitter receptors to bring  about different biological activities.  This research is  aimed at determining how one of the major subunits of the G  proteins interacts with the receptors to determine the  specificity of the reaction. Since G proteins are important  for many biological functions, these studies will be  important for understanding of the basic mechanisms involved  in determining which reactions will occur.",
