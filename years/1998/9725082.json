 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725082  Blakely    This project utilizes periodic structures for fundamental  studies of the dynamics of semiconductor surfaces, the  production of stepfree substrates, and oxidation of high  aspect-ratio nanostructures. The evolution of mesoscale  structure will be studied in a context in which connection  to the underlying physical mechanisms and appropriate  theoretical approach to describing macroscopic structure  evolution are addressed. Focus  of the project is on fundamental understanding and  control of surface structural defects, the kinetics  of surface morphological changes, and the effect of  morphology on lattice strain in the near-surface  region. Initially most of the experiments will be  done with silicon, but extension to other materials,  Ge, C, GaAs and SiGe alloys will be considered. Major  experimental methods for the structural and kinetic  studies will be scanning tunneling and atomic force  microscopy, low energy electron diffraction and  microscopy and surface X-ray diffraction.  Conventional nanofabrication methods of  sample  preparation will be complemented by novel techniques  to create periodically patterned surfaces of very  small periods.  %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a  topical area of materials science having high  technological relevance. The research will contribute  basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental  level to important aspects of electronic/photonic  devices.  Experimental tools are now available to  allow atomic level observation of elementary surface  processes which when better understood will allow  advances in both fundamental science and technology.  The basic knowledge and understanding gained from the  research is expected to contribute to improving the  perform ance and stability of advanced devices and  circuits by providing a fundamental understanding and  a basis for designing and producing improved  materials, and materials combinations.  An important  feature of the program is the integration of researc h  and education through the training of students in a  fundamentally and technologically significant area.  ***",
