 "awd_abstract_narration": "Waltman  9801622       The chemostat (also called a continuous culture or a  bioreactor) is a basic model of an open system.  It is a model of  a simple lake, a laboratory version of the commercial  bio-reactor, and the starting point for models of waste water  treatment and models of the mammalian intestine.  Microorganisms  compete for an input nutrient in an exploitative manner.  The  equations governing the model take the form  of systems of  nonlinear ordinary or partial differential equations.  In this  project, the investigator adds new features to the basic model in  order to make it more realistic.  This complicates the equations  and hence the mathematical analysis.  Specifically, the effects of  wall growth, diffusion, transport, inhibitors (natural and  external), and plasmid dynamics on the outcome of the competition  are to be studied.  The goal of the mathematical analysis is to  identify the global asymptotic behavior of the solutions to these  equations in terms of the system parameters (measurable or  operational parameters).       Inhibitors occur naturally (for example, anti-competitor  toxins) or as pollutants.  Growth of microorganisms on the wall  (or other surface) can impede the efficiency of a biochemical  reactor or contaminate any flow process.  The asymptotic analysis  of such problems can lead to a better understanding of natural  phenomena or of reactor technology.  Knowledge of this behavior  allows one to predict the outcome of a fixed (i.e., natural)  environment or to control the outcome in the case of an  artificial (commercial) environment.  All of the effects mentioned  above come together is models of the mammalian intestine where  wall growth is essential to the process, inhibitors affect the  competition and where transport and diffusion cannot be ignored.  One of the objectives of the study is to provide a better model  of the human large intestine and a better understanding of the  relative effect of each of the phenomena involved.",
