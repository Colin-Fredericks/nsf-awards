 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803843  This project investigates formal methods for programming object-  oriented (OO) software components. The goals are to produce: (a)  theoretical foundations to support careful reasoning about such  components, and (b) expressive behavioral interface specification  languages (BISLs) that are able to substitute for the source code  of such components. Foundational issues for goal (a) include the  model theory and proof theory of abstract data types with mutable  objects, subtyping, aliasing, and message passing. The model  theory of our previous work is extended to account for  nondeterminism and higher-order procedures. In proof theory,  equational reasoning techniques for reasoning about immutable  objects are sought. These results are to be connected with  verification logics for OO languages with the new feature of  multimethods. Goal (b) helps vendors explain OO class libraries  and frameworks to customers without giving them source code,  which cannot be done with existing BISLs. This project provides:  guidance for the design of more expressive OO specification  languages, ideas for use in documentation of OO class libraries  and frameworks, and expressive notations for specification.  Software engineers will also benefit from more expressive BISLs  and the ideas about reasoning.***",
