 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hanken  9801586               This study will examine the development of the skull in several  species of amphibians (frogs). Its main goals are to better understand the  molecular and genetic processes that underlie the embryonic development of bone  in the heads of vertebrate animals, and how these processes are modified during  evolution to achieve diversity of skull size and shape among species. It also  will provide greater understanding of the developmental bases for direct  development, a widespread but poorly studied life-history mode found in many  species of living amphibians, and how direct development evolved from the  ancestral, metamorphic life history. Individual analyses will employ several  different laboratory procedures. These include labelling embryonic cells with  vital dyes and embryonic tissue recombinations (to identify which cells  contribute to the adult skull); histology and immunocytochemistry (to study  detailed aspects of cranial anatomy); and recombinant DNA technologies, in situ  hybridization, and implantation of protein-soaked beads (to identify genes that  are involved in bone formation and determine the likely functions of each). By  supporting this research, this award also will enhance the education and  training of a postgraduate student and better prepare the PI for a career in  higher education and biological research.",
