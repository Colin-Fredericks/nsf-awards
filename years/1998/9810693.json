 "awd_abstract_narration": "Andrew Postlewaite  This grant funds the continuation of the PIs' research on economic models that incorporate social arrangements among agents. This work is based on the idea that in most societies, there are goods and decisions that are determined through standard markets and, in addition, there are some that are not.  People group themselves together in many ways for productive and social activities. In general, people care (often deeply) about which groups (firms, partnerships) they are members of. Positions at prestigious law firms, investment banking companies, on the board of trustees for Ivy League universities or the Metropolitan Museum of Art are highly sought. At first pass, there appear to be many people with roughly similar qualifications, some who obtain the positions and some who do not. Moreover, many of the people who do not obtain the position appear to be willing to pay substantially to obtain such a position. Markets don't seem to mediate well the process by which these groups form and evolve. If every person to whom a law firm makes an offer is ecstatic about receiving it, why doesn't the law firm lower the wage until the marginal person is indifferent to receiving the offer or not? Why is it that memberships to boards of trustees and clubs are not openly bought and sold in a normal market manner if they are so desired? A major source of the nontrivial interrelationship between economic market behavior and social arrangements is due to the strict preferences that people have over these social arrangements, and the resulting incentives that people have to take actions to affect their ultimate position. For example, do workers or firms have an incentive before hiring takes place to make excessive investments in order to improve their hiring prospects? We propose to investigate why it is that markets may not efficiently mediate group formation, and so to understand the incentives that people have to affect their social arrangements.  The multiplicity of equilibria stemming from different social arrangements is a valuable tool in understanding differences in economic behavior and performance across economies. It is important to understand why different societies are governed by different social arrangements. The second part of the proposal focuses on two questions. The first is: How do different social organizations arise? We propose to study models in which the social arrangements within a community change in response to experience. In particular, we will study how agents can develop `authority` in environments in which it is efficient for people to take a common action. The second question concerns how the economic nature of the environment affects the set of equilibrium social arrangements. A modeling approach is described that, taking as given an intrinsic concern for status, investigates how status can be determined. In some societies education determines status, birth in others, and wealth in yet others. How does the nature of interactions between members of a community affect the determinants of status?",
