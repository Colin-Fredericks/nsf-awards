 "awd_abstract_narration": "M. Cecilia Aguila  IBN-9805774    The overall goal of this application is to define the  molecular and  intracellular mechanisms by which cyclic  guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cGMP) increases somatostatin  (SRIF) gene transcription.  SRIF is a substance originally  found in the brain by its ability to inhibit growth hormone  secretion.  The production of SRIF is regulated by several  intracellular compounds such as nitric oxide, cyclic  adenosine monophosphate, and cGMP. In earlier studies, Dr.  Aguila found that nitric oxide modulated SRIF gene  expression through a cGMP mediated-mechanism.  The presence  of that intracellular mechanisms in the brain imply  that  cGMP-mediated control of SRIF synthesis can occur in  neurons, raising the intriguing possibility of an  unsuspected role for cGMP in the regulation of SRIF gene  transcription.    This application proposes a combination of physiological,  cellular and molecular approaches to address this issue and  to test the validity of the intracellular signaling pathways  hypothesized to control SRIF production. These experiments  will be conducted in primary cultures of neuronal origin and  cell lines of either neuronal or glial origin found to  produce SRIF. Accordingly, we will examine the hypothesis  that a  mechanism by which cyclic GMP increases SRIF  synthesis involves transcriptional activation of the SRIF  gene.    Neuronal plasticity depends on the capacity of cells to  adjust to environmental stimuli.  The reasons for this cell  specificity are only now beginning to be understood.  The  SRIF gene,  provides a good model for examining how stimuli  detected on the cell surface, influence neuronal gene  expression. Advances in the understanding of SRIF  biosynthesis may have an impact on areas outside the field  of endocrinology by providing new notions of eukaryotic gene  regulation.",
