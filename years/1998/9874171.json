 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project consists of a series of studies to investigate the outputs, outcomes, and impacts of statewide systemic initiatives on student learning, curriculum, and policy.  The first study will analyze mathematics NAEP data at three grade levels for three years (1990, 1992, and 1996).  The percent of students at or above mathematics proficiency will be compared for 22 SSI states and 17 non-SSI states.  In a second study, existing state assessment data in mathematics and science for targeted states will be studied for total score and scale scores over the time period of 1990 through 1999.  The third study will analyze the relationship among change in student outcomes, process indicators, and systemic reform attributes with the level that districts/schools within a state have engaged in a SSI.  Additionally, existing information on systemic reform will be mined and summarized through a series of small focus conferences of expert consultants.  New research findings from the studies described above will be used to refine the information and generate new interpretations.",
