 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award of the Professional Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE) program funded through the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) supports the research and educational activities of Professor Robin Garrell of the University of California at Los Angeles.  The research aims to extend the techniques currently existing in her laboratory to a new area, the study of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs).  Boranes and carboranes, such as boranethiols and carborod derivatives, will be used as the basis for new types of SAMs on noble metal and oxide surfaces.  The topology, adsorbate-surface interactions, and stability will be examined using various analytical techniques as well as quantum-mechanical calculations.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity afforded through the POWRE program will enhance Professor Garrell's research potential as well as her educational mentoring of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral scientists.  Her investigations of these borane-based self-assembled monolayers can serve as models for adhesion, wetting, and other interfacial processes.  This work could ultimately benefit the manufacture of electronics, sensors, and thin-film coatings.\r\n",
