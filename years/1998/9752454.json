 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of Biology 2000 is to develop a new syllabus, complete with course materials, for teaching introductory biology to non-science majors and future teachers.  Biology 2000 addresses a problem of national importance. Undergraduate science education in America needs revision. Too many students studying science in college are \"turned off\" by the experience and intimidated by their classes. This has led to an unfortunate paradox: Living in a highly technical society, Americans lack an understanding of science. The Biology 2000 approach helps students understand science and the nature of discovery by organizing the concepts of biology around major experiments and discoveries in the field.  In Biology 2000, biology is taught as a logical progression of ideas starting with Darwinian evolution, progressing through the major discoveries in the field, and ending with today's exciting challenges. Three components of Biology 2000 are being co-developed as an integrated package: A relatively brief textbook tells the story of biology in a highly readable style that introduces concepts and builds motivation. Accompanying CDs walk students through difficult concepts using interactive animations, video clips and \"virtual experiments.\"  An extensive World Wide Web site is a source of further detail, self-tests, a glossary and links to other relevant Internet sites. By Fall of 1997, five of the 12 anticipated chapters will be in first draft stage, ready for preliminary beta testing and revision. We are seeking support from NSF to complete the project. Wiley and Sons, Publishers has agreed to publish and disseminate the Biology 2000 materials. A professional software development company has been contracted to develop the CDs.",
