 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Zoology Section of the University of Colorado Museum  (UCM) contains the largest vertebrate and non-entomological  invertebrate collections in Colorado, with geographical  strengths in the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains regions,  and particular taxonomic strengths in molluscs, amphibians,  and reptiles.  The university's increased commitment to the  Zoology Section (and the UCM as a whole) is evidenced by the  creation of new positions for a Curator of Vertebrates and a  Collection Manager, both of which were filled within the  last four years. The current project will continue  enhancements of the Zoology Section's research and teaching  functions by augmenting the current inadequate specimen  storage facilitaties, and eliminating the remaining specimen  backlog.  Specifically, the project will (1) obtain 46  museum cabinets and 25 shelving units to house the backlog  and inadequately housed catalogued specimens, and account  for collections growth over the next decade; (2) increase  the Collection Manager position from 75% to fulltime in  order to process the backlog in the next two years.  A  permanent fulltime Collection Manager will allow the  collections to be maintained properly, speed computerization  of the specimen database, and increase access to the  collections.    This project will maintain the physical integrity of the  Zoology Section's holdings, provide access for researchers  and educators to the currently inaccessible backlog,  facilitate access to specimens already catalogued, and,  through dissemination of the results of the project,  increase awareness of the Zoology Section in the research  community.  The proposed enhancements of the section are in  accord with the recommendations of a recent Institute of  Museum Studies Collections Assessment Program review.  In  addition, the curators of the various Sections within the  UCM have recommended that priority be given to the Zoology  and Paleobiology Section.  Finally the project is especially  timely because of the up coming move of the Zoology Section  to a newly renovated building, planned for the year 2001;  the move will be facilitated by the presence of appropriate  storage facilities for all specimens, and  by elimination of  the specimen backlog.",
