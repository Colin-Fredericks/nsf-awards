 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731001  Cailliet    Declining fisheries and adverse impacts to benthic habitats  and biodiversity are a worldwide concern as coastal  resources around the world increasingly are being modified  by combined natural and human disturbances.  Scientists from  many Pacific nations and interested organizations have  organized a conference to discuss state-of-the-art research  using geophysical and biological sampling tools to describe  benthic habitats as they relate to marine biodiversity and  fisheries issues in the Pacific to take place from November  10-16 in Noumea, New Caledonia.  A group of fifteen American  researchers, including ten senior investigators and five  graduate students will be able to attend the conference as a  result of the present award.   Attendance is expected to  include many representatives from small Pacific island  nations and territories such as the Cook Islands, Fiji,  Guam, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, and Western Samoa, to  name a few, as well as from the larger Pacific Nations  including Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and  the United States.  France is also sending a sizable  contingent, and French institutions are centrally involved  in the planning, including the Institut Francais de  Recherche pour l'Exploitation de la Mer (IFREMER) and the  Institut Francais de Recherche Scientifique pour le  Developpment en Cooperation (OSTROM).  Drs. Jean-Marie  Auzende and Rene Grandperrin of IFREMER and OSTROM  respectively are helping to plan the meeting.  This  conference is expected to create greater opportunities for  American scientists to pursue research and education in  marine benthic habitats and biodiversity and to provide  Pacific island scientists and officials with scientific  information useful in managing their marine habitats.",
