 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cole \r\n9807555\r\nThe freshwater ciliate, Tetrahymena thermophila, will be the experimental organism used to explore the developmental regulation of the conjugation program. The research objectives are: 1) To further explore the developmental dependencies and developmental logic underlying conjugation in Tetrahymena thermophila, 2) To use advanced microscopy techniques to produce an ultra-detailed description of nuclear-cytoskeletal interactions during critical points in development and, 3) To assist in the development and/or implementation of molecular genetic procedures designed to identify conjugation specific genes and explore their function.\r\n \r\nConjugation in Tetrahymena thermophila is interesting in that such fundamental cellular events as meiosis, nuclear exchange and fertilization, programmed nuclear elimination, transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome and genomic reorganization all occur within a highly synchronous population at well defined times during a twelve hour schedule. A method of generating mutations that affect the conjugation pathway was developed during the tenure of the previous award. Thirteen conjugation mutants affecting nearly every stage of conjugal development were isolated and characterized. Such characterization allowed the production of a detailed model of developmental dependencies, which underlie the conjugation program. The continuation of this work will not only allow further insight into fundamental genetic mechanisms but will serve to educate students in the demands as well as the satisfaction of basic research.\r\n",
