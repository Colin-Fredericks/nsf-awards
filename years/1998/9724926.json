The co-organizers are Professors  Mahendra Singh of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and Yutaka  Inoue of Osaka University in Japan.  The seminar will focus  on innovative concepts involving new algorithms, sensors,  actuators and dampers.  They will also discuss some full  scale trial implementation of active control devices in  Japan, primarily for low level disturbances.    Session will focus on four theme topics:  (1) active  semi-  active and hybrid control, (2) control of buildings, bridges  and lifelines, (3) system integration, design philosophies  and code provisions, and (4) case studies and experimental  verification on international testbeds.  These will be  followed by summarization of the status of the structural  control on these topics in order to identify the outstanding  research issues.  They will then formulate an action plan  with recommendations for development and implementation.  Participants will include younger scientists.  The  proceedings will be published and also disseminated through  the internet. The exchange of ideas and data with Japanese  experts in this field will enable U.S. participants to  advance their own work, and will set the stage for future  collaborative projects.  ***",
