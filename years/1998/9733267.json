Martinez  \"CAREER: Developing the Infrastructure for the Widespread  Use of Simulation in the Analysis of Construction  Operations\"      This CAREER award supports research leading to the  development of a new infrastructure needed for the  widespread adoption, acceptance, and use of simulation as an  analysis and design tool for construction operations.  The  project addresses a national priority for Federal research  and development for industries that produce constructed  facilities.  It will allow for significant improvements in  planning with substantial reductions in the cost and time  spent building them.  Consequently, it will enhance the  international competitiveness of U.S. industry and reduce  total life cycle costs.      The Principal Investigator will build on the previously  developed advanced programmable tool and simulation  programming language for construction operations, to create  a comprehensive and exemplary special-purpose simulator for  earthwork operations.  The language will also be used to  create an advanced general-purpose simulation tool that does  not require programming.  These tools will complement  existing ones to cover the entire spectrum of tool  complexity and modeling power needed to simulate  construction operations at all levels.  The common  representation vehicle across all tools will solidify the  use of Activity Cycle Diagrams as the universal means of  describing construction operations.    The educational aspect of the project is intricately related  to and dependent on the research.  It includes the  development of multimedia tutorials, active learning games,  workshops for educators, and an undergraduate construction  simulation course.  Its aim is to educate future  construction practitioners at various levels, from educated  users of special-purpose simulators to builders of models  for complex operations, to builders of special-purpose  simulato rs.  With adequate numbers of suitable educated  personnel at each level of proficiency, it will be possible  to construct all facilities in a computer without expending  any resources.  Construction operations will be planned so  well that they will flow smoothly and with no surprises.  The ever scarcer resources needed for construction will be  used as efficiently as possible.",
