Gobbert    Computational Methods for the Simulation of Chemical Vapor Deposition  on Rough Surfaces    Abstract:    In chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes a mixture of reacting  gases is applied to the surface of a semiconductor wafer in the  reaction chamber of a chemical reactor. A thin film of material is  formed on the surface via surface reactions with the surface material.  The wafer surface contains small trenches and holes, collectively  referred to as features, for interconnect lines, transistor gates,  etc., thus making the surface rough. Currently, reactor scale models  (RSM) based on the Navier-Stokes equations capture the flow of the  reacting gases throughout the entire reactor chamber with a typical  dimension of 10 centimeters, and feature scale models (FSM) based on  kinetic equations predict the film growth profile inside a single  feature with a typical dimension of 1 micrometer. Due to the extreme  difference of length scales, an integrated process model spanning all  length scales of interest is best obtained by introducing a mesoscopic  scale model (MSM) with typical dimension on the order of 1 millimeter.  This project will develop the mathematical model and computational  methods for the appropriate kinetic equations in the low pressure  regime on this scale.    This project is part of an effort at modeling the manufacturing  processes of computer chips. Computers are already and will continue to  be one of the most important tools of our economy and technology. There  is a trend towards more specialized computer chips to be produced in  smaller numbers, for instance for specific applications in space  exploration or defense systems.  But prototype runs necessary to test  the manufacturing processes use expensive chemicals and produce  hazardous exhaust gases, which need to be treated before releasing them  to the environment.  For these reasons, interest in simulating the  manufacturing processes on all scales from individual device to fa ctory  floor has been increasing. This project will contribute to the  development of appropriate models as well as better numerical  techniques for the process of chemical vapor deposition, one of the  crucial production steps for computer chips. In this process, a thin  layer of material is deposited to form either the electrical lines or  the electronic devices that make up the computer chip in the final  product.",
