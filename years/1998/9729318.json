 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Thomas C.   Pochapsky, of the Department of Chemistry at Brandeis University, is   studying the structure and dynamics of closed-shell ion pairs in   solution.  These studies are focused on both the development of a general   methodology for the characterization of dynamic self-assembling systems   (i.e., multimolecular complexes in which individual components undergo   rapid exchange on the NMR time scale) and the development of a more   complete understanding of chemical processes which involve ion pairing.    Nuclear Overhauser Effect studies probe the time-averaged structures of   ion pairs and, when combined with nuclear relaxation data, provide   information about motional behavior.  Pulsed field gradient NMR methods   allow measurement of self-diffusion coefficients for the ion pairs,   allowing the determination of their aggregation state.  These studies are   complemented by infrared spectral analysis and by computational methods.  Through a combination of experimental and computational studies,   Professor Thomas C. Pochapsky, of the Department of Chemistry at Brandeis   University, studies the structure and dynamics of ion pairs, molecular   aggregates which display discrete interactions between positively and   negatively charged species.  Such ion pairs are observed under a variety   of conditions in chemical and biological systems, have been implicated as   intermediates in many types of reactions, and are involved in biological   processes such as ion transport and molecular recognition.  With the   support of the Organic Dynamics Program, Professor Pochapsky is   developing an in-depth understanding of the structures of ion pairs and   of the dynamic processes associated with them.",
