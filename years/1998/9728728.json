 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728728  HOLLIDAY     There is much evidence indicating that the  development of undifferentiated cells into neurons is dependent  both upon intrinsic patterns of gene expression as well as on  interactions with neighboring cells, including electrical  signaling.  Early in neuronal differentiation, the elevation of  intracellular calcium ions carries much of the electrical signal.  Calcium elevation is one of the first steps in the activation of a  large variety of cellular signal transduction cascades in all cell  types and is therefore very likely to be involved in regulating  gene expression and other \"experience-dependent\" mechanisms that  regulate development.  There is accumulating evidence that  precisely timed changes in the cellular mechanisms that produce  transient increases in intracellular calcium may underlie the  \"critical periods\" of neuronal development.       This project is designed to determine how the alteration of  the level of expression of specific calcium ion regulatory  proteins affects transient calcium signaling and subsequent  neuronal development.  Two calcium regulatory proteins will be  separately investigated: a calcium buffering protein (calbindin)  and an intracellular calcium induced calcium release channel  (CICR).  The level of these proteins will be experimentally  manipulated by the introduction DNA constructs that either produce  additional target protein or specifically reduce endogenous target  protein expression.  The experiments will be performed in a well-  controlled and characterized culture system of rat cerebellar  granule neurons.  Since intracellular calcium homeostasis is  tightly controlled by a variety of mechanisms, alteration of one  target may trigger compensatory changes in other regulatory  mechanisms.  Therefore, the physiological consequences of changing  protein expression will be measured with imaging techniques that  directly measure intracellular calcium ion concentrations, both at  rest and during stimulation.  The developmental  consequences of  changes in target protein expression will be assessed by measuring  the acquisition of several developmental markers.       The results of these studies will refine our understanding of  how calcium transients regulate neuronal development at the single  cell level, and develop tools to more definitively test hypotheses  about the mechanisms regulating neuronal synaptic organization.  The long-range goal of this project is to transiently manipulate  calcium regulatory mechanisms during development in vivo to  determine whether perturbations of calcium levels, during  sensitive defined in vitro, will result in developmental delays or  permanent changes in the mature central nervous system.",
