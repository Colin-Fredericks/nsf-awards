 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future wireless systems based on Code Division Multiple  Access (CDMA) schemes will impose stringent interference  rejection requirements at the receiver's front end. The  development of appropriate signal processing algorithms to  suppress multiuser interference is an essential factor in  the success of third generation wireless networks. The  objective of research is to explore the connections between  interference rejection problems appearing in wireless,  multiuser communications and classical signal processing  concepts like array processing and multichannel  deconvolution. By developing those links and establishing a  DSP framework for multiuser communication problems, we will  facilitate the application of a large body of DSP algorithms  and research results to those problems. Similarly, the  integration of communication and DSP links in the Electrical  Engineering curriculum provides the students with a global  understanding of DSP aspects of wireless communication  systems.  The first research goal is to develop appropriate  discrete-time models for multiuser CDMA systems with chip  rate sampling, and identify the analogies with well  established array processing models. The second objective is  to develop simple, adaptive, linear receivers based on these  models, which are self-recovering, yet attain a performance  comparable to that of the trained MMSE receiver. These blind  solutions borrow ideas from standard array processing  techniques like Capon and MVDR beamforming. The educational  goal of this work is to promote linear deconvolution ideas  as a significant and unifying component in the systems  thread of the EE curriculum. This component is introduced in  various courses through laboratory and design work. The  approach is based on developing an innovative lab  infrastructure which allows remote experimentation and  capitalizes upon the campus networking resources.  Additionally, a focus on ``signal processing for  communications'' is being developed in the graduate and  under graduate curriculum through course development and  restructuring.",
