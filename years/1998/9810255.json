 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research examines the impacts of local and regional environmental organizations on the behavior of the U.S. gold-mining industry, one of the most environmentally controversial industries of the decade.  The PI questions whether local and regional environmental organizations (EOs) have any influence in shaping the geography and environmental practices of mineral development, and whether the changes in industry behavior go beyond the local and regional scales.  As the popularity and proactiveness of formal environmental institutions wanes, it is critical to understand how and with what effectiveness non-governmental institutions perform. A qualitative research design will be used that depends on archival research and in-depth interviews to delineated the `stimulus-response` processes for five major initiatives conducted by Montana-based EOs during the late 1980s through to the present.  In addition, the PI will relate external market conditions and individual firm characteristics to firm responses. This study will be the first to identify and assess empirically the effects of local and regional EOs on industry environmental practices and investment decisions.",
