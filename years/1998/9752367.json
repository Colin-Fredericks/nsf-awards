 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses science literacy and knowledge transfer from research to the classroom.  This initiative allows students to participate in the work of science by collecting real Earth data, making authentic observations on the sea-floor, and analyzing and interpreting obtained results.  Interactive, multimedia modules for a general education class and also for preservice teacher use in their classrooms is being developed.  The emphasis is on teaching students both content and the process of doing science.  Many of the investigations are automatically graded and posted to the students' records, thereby allowing instructors to help students in higher cognitive levels of understanding.   The project develops a \"Virtual Science Workshop\", and \"Virtual Reality Field Trip to the Mid-Ocean Ridges\", both of which build on, and integrate with, the recently developed \"Our Dynamic Planet\" CD-ROM, created by the PI, with support from NSF.  The interactive \"Virtual Science Workshop\"  will be modeled after a real science workshop.  It will address the issues of providing students with background information in an engaging way, modeling how scientists argue from evidence, and helping students to pose their own experimental problem.  The \"Virtual  Reality Field Trip\" to the mid-ocean ridges will use the latest research data from ongoing ridge and vent studies to create a dynamic field laboratory where students can explore, gather data, and analyze their findings.",
