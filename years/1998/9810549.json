The pixel is based upon the formation of an inversion channel at a GaAs heterointerface.  The approach builds upon existing technology demonstrations which have shown that an inversion channel interface can be created that produces a Heterostructure Field Effect Transistor (BYET) that is mutually compatible in structure and fabrication with a Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL).  The integration of these components will enable transmission of image data from the chip in optical form, A key innovation is the use of carbon doping in the form of CBr4 to create the effect of a resistive gate structure which has already been recognized as an effective method to achieve high frequency operation.  The use of the p doped gate structure will permit the use of ion implants to create the unidirectional charge transfer barriers that are necessary for uniphase operation.  The sensor is expected to have superior charge capacity, higher frequency operation, lower dark current/dynamic range and lower background noise than existing approaches in Ill-V material systems.\r\n\r\nThe existing approaches to Ill-V CCD devices use a deposited cermet resistive layer upon the grown wafer to improve transfer efficiency.  With this method, conduction between gate electrodes and increased gate leakage current are problems.  Furthermore, the interelectrode potential barriers remain a problem in practice, because the electrodes on the cermet layer are at least 4000 A above the surface.  The deposited layer also aggravates the interface trap noise problem.  With the inversion channel approach proposed here, the resistive layer is grown within the @E structure and all electrodes are within a few hundred A of the interface.  Furthermore the HFET electronic circuits have as-grown enhancement thresholds of 0.3 V so that threshold nonuniformity is not the problem of traditional Ill-V digital circuits.  Of most significance, is the fact that FFEMT and MESFET technologies have not been able to easily integrate the laser device, This natural compatibility is the key advantage of the inversion channel structure and enables a single chip solution to the high speed transport of imaged data-\r\n\r\nThe inversion channel approach uses solid source MBE growth of the vertical cavity structure, p doped layers via (BI-4 for ohmic contacts and resistive layer formation, deposited dielectric top stacks, and oxidized AlAs layers for critical current guiding in the laser.  A single fabrication sequence consisting of self-aligned refractory gate contacts and ion-implanted channel contacts is proposed to implement the circuit.  The technology implementation required here builds upon the principal investigators prior work in fabricating HYETs and VCSELS.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\t \r\n",
