The focus of research will  be the intermetallic compound NiAl.  The project includes  collaborations with groups working on ab initio calculations  and on diffusion experiments.    Atomic structure and diffusion along grain boundaries in  intermetallic compounds are of great interest in connection  with their limited ductility and high-temperature creep  resistance.  Grain boundary diffusion in NiAl has never been  studied experimentally or theoretically.  Moreover, correct  atomistic calculations of grain boundary diffusion  coefficients have only become possible recently due to work  done by the proposers on the jump correlation theory and the  development of the respective simulation methods.  These  theory and simulation techniques will be further improved  and applied to grain boundaries in NiAl.    Angular-dependent semi-empirical potentials of the embedded-  atom type will be developed for NiAl by fitting to both  experimental properties and to the results of ab initio  calculations.  The atomic structure for  001  and  011   symmetrical tilt grain boundaries will be calculated using  molecular statics and dynamics.  The formation energies and  equilibrium concentrations of point defects in the lattice  and in the grain boundaries will be calculated.  The atomic  migration energies by different mechanisms in the lattice  and in the grain boundary cores will also be calculated.  The point defect concentrations and migration energies  obtained will be used for the calculation of lattice and  grain boundary diffusion coefficients of Ni and Al using  novel methods of jump correlation theory and the Monte Carlo  method.  The diffusion coefficients obtained will be  compared with the experimental data obtained from  experimental collaborators.  NiAl will thus become the first   ordered system, probably even the first binary system, where  diffusion of both species in the lattice and along the grain  boundaries will be studied by both experimental and  theoretical methods.  %%%  This project is aimed at theoretical investigations and  computer simulations of point defects and grain boundaries,  as well as diffusion in the lattice and along grain  boundaries in ordered compounds.
