 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract    Proposal:  DMS-9803051  Principal Investigators: Eugene Lerman and Susan Tolman    The issues being investigated in this study of Hamiltonian systems  include: classifying symplectic manifolds with Hamiltonian group  action, determining when such manifolds admit Kaehler structures,  computing their cohomology rings, the capacities of symplectic  quotients, intersection cohomology of singular quotients, and the  two-body problem on the sphere.  The special case of symplectic  manifolds with large torus actions is particularly amenable to study.  Working with Y. Karshon, S. Tolman has reduced the classification  question to combinatorics and homotopy information in the case where  the torus is of dimension which is one less than half the dimension of  the manifold.  The principal investigators plan to use these methods  to find necessary and sufficient conditions for such a space to admit  an invariant Kaehler structure.  S. Tolman also hopes to use these  techniques and recent results in symplectic topology to extend the  results to tori of dimension two less than half the dimension of the  manifold.  The investigators also plan to address the question of  invariants of reduced spaces, and together with T. Tokieda they will  investigate the capacity of symplectic quotients.  They will also  study the cohomology of reduced spaces, both at regular values (joint  work by S. Tolman and J.  Weitsman), and at singular values (joint  with J. Ho.)  Finally, E. Lerman (jointly with T. Tokieda) will study  the two body problem on the two sphere -- a limiting case of two  coupled rigid bodies.  The techniques include classifying relative  equilibria, the energy-momentum method, and numerical simulation.    On the scale of everyday life, essentially all objects follow paths  determined by the laws of classical mechanics.  In many cases -- for  example, a spinning top, two coupled rigid bodies, a satellite with  flexible attachments, or the solar system itself -- the mechanical  system possesses a  great deal of symmetry.  In these cases, for each  degree of symmetry there is a conserved quantity, called ``momentum''.  Linear and angular momentum are the most common examples of this  phenomena.  A great deal can be learned about such systems both by  studying the momentum, and by ``dividing out'' by the set of  symmetries to study a simpler system.  We study systems which, while  not necessarily examples of concrete physical systems, abstract out  many of the common features of such systems.  We intend to study,  among other questions, what happens when systems have very large  amounts of symmetry, how to deal with singularities which sometimes  arise in ``dividing out'' by symmetries, and how to use the momentum  to answer important questions about the system.  Our work,including  both the results and some of the methods we plan to develop, should be  useful to scientists and engineers studying concrete physical systems.",
