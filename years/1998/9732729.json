 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   Program provides continued support to Dr. Kenneth G. Caulton of the   Chemistry Department, Indiana University, for synthesis and reaction   studies of unsaturated organometallic compounds.  Theoretical work will   be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Odile Eisenstein of the   Universite de Montpellier, France.  The goal of the research is to   determine reactivity patterns for compounds having several different   functional ligands attached to the same metal atom.   The compounds   synthesized will contain a mixture of ligands such as hydride, halide,   alkyl, and carbene.  Relative reactivity of various ligands will be   determined directly and complex reactions such as alkyl migration and   intramolecular reduction elimination in the same molecule will be   monitored.  Multifunctional metal complexes may also deliver more than   one functional group to another molecule.  The target compounds will be   selected because of their ability to undergo nucleophilic or oxidation   reactions at low temperature.  Studying reactivity under these conditions   improves the possibility of identifying primary reaction products and   maximizes the selectivity of reactions.  Thermodynamic parameters will be   determined.  Specific reactions to be investigated include reductive   elimination of benzene from osmium carbonyls, removal of halide from   16-electron species to form 14-electron compounds, and reaction of   trifluoromethyl ligands to form difluoromethyl ligands.  Unusual reactions of a wide range of organometallic compounds will be   studied, including C-H and C-F bond activation and reactivity of   coordinatively unsaturated compounds.  Reactions of this kind are   important to obtaining a basic understanding the behavior of homogeneous   catalysts.",
