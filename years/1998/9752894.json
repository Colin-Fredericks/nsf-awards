 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to make a sweeping reform in the undergraduate chemistry curriculum by adapting the fruits of the two systemic reform projects ModularChem Consortium at University of California, Berkeley, and Chemlinks Coalition at Beloit College, Wisconsin. Materials and methods from these two projects are being adapted for general chemistry and analytical chemistry courses. These changes emphasize the relevance of chemistry in modern society and it application to real problems.  Some non-science majors who  take general chemistry as part of their graduation requirements will also be impacted.     Pertinent, locally produced, low-cost equipment are incorporated in the laboratory activities. This approach emphasizes the investigative nature of science through chemical applications.  The following approaches are being used:  (1) adopting and adapting the interdisciplinary modular approach in the teaching of general, chemistry, analytical courses; (2) making the laboratory more active, facilitating collaborative learning and the centerpiece of the student learning experience; (3) providing students with a more accurate picture of scientific processes by which scientists organize data, share their data and design experiments; (4) aquatinting the faculty with the tools in current teaching methods incorporating contemporary information technology.    Concentrating on the first two years of the chemistry curriculum, impacts the largest number of students, including those who major in chemistry. In this process, advanced chemistry courses will also be modified and affected in an important way.",
