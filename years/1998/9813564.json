A unique   opportunity exists to achieve these objectives simultaneously through shear   wave velocity measurements during a blast-induced ground improvement pilot   program at the Oakridge Sanitary Landfill in Dorchester County, South   Carolina.    Shear wave velocity in the solid waste is measured by monitoring ground   motions induced by the test blasts, while shear wave velocity of the   improved ground is measured before and after blasting using crosshole and   downhole testing. These shear wave velocity measurements on the solid waste   and in the ground before and after blasting will provide valuable insight   into the dynamic behavior of these materials, and may identify important   phenomenon that merit further investigation.    Information on the shear wave velocity of municipal solid waste is limited   to data obtained in southern California landfills, yet it is the basis for   evaluation of the seismic response of landfills throughout the United   States. Solid waste shear wave velocities at the relatively wet Oakridge   Landfill that differ from those at arid southern California landfills would   provide evidence of regional differences in waste properties. These   potential differences could have a major impact on the seismic design of   landfills outside of southern California.    Recent data from a dynamic-consolidation ground-improvement project show   that the induced densification was overestimated using conventional   penetration  testing due to increases in lateral stress. Shear wave velocity   measurements before and after blasting can provide an important check on   the validity of cone penetrometer resistance as a measure of improvement,   and may provide a more immediate and cost-effective means of verifying   improvement, and can provide important insights into the mechanisms of   improvement.    +=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+   Clifford J.
