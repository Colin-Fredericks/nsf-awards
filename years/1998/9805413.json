 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation will continue its long term  support of the University of  Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring  Research. This grant allows the laboratory to hire a full-time  dendrochronologist to analyze archaeological samples and also  provides support for student  assistants.    The technique of tree-ring dating was pioneered at the University of Arizona.  Because the rate of treegrowth is determined by environmental  conditions, yearly growth rings in a tree vary in form and thickness. It is possible to build up a tree ring chronology by  cross matching trees from the present to well back in the  prehistoric past and then to use this `master record` to date  small wood samples collected from archaeological and other  situations. For archaeologists in the Southwestern United States,  this technique has been a boon because it allows materials to be  dated within one year. This far exceeds the accuracy of  radiocarbon dating.    Because it has not been adequately supported and because many  archaeologists lack the funds to pay for its services, the  Arizona laboratory has not  been able on its own to keep pace with  archaeological requests for sample dating. This grant will  help  to remedy that situation.  In particular, it will benefit young  scientists and those not  associated with more wealthy main line research  institutions.",
