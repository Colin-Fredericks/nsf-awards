 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803189  Behringer    This RUI project aims to develop an apparatus to perform  depthresolved and laterally spatially-resolved  photoluminescence(PL) on semiconductors at liquid He  temperature, and to involve undergraduates in experimental  research. This is to be achieved by constructing an insert  for a helium bath cryostat that eliminates difficulties of  immersed beam paths and optics while providing a lateral  resolution of approximately one micrometer by using  mechanically simple and thermally robust translation  mechanisms. The depth resolution will be achieved by using  different excitation wavelengths. After spectral dispersion,  the photoluminescence signal will be detected with a liquid  nitrogen cooled germanium photodiode. The completion and  utilization of this system provides opportunities for  students to gain experience in mechanical, thermal, and  optical design and construction, computer interfacing,  experimental design, and collection and interpretation of  basic research data.  %%%  The project primarily addresses the introduction and  training of undergraduate students in basic research issues  in a topical area of materials science having high  technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic  materials science knowledge and primary educational benefits  to undergraduates in fundamental aspects of  electronic/photonic materials properties.  An important  feature of the program is the integration of research and  education through the training of  undergraduate students in  a fundamentally and technologically significant area.  ***",
