 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is aimed at increasing and sustaining students'   participation in chemistry at Howard University by enhancing the training   facility through acquisition of the PerSeptive MALDI-TOF-MS/MS system.   Laboratory experiments that incorporate the use of this state-of-the-art   mass spectrometer into the biochemistry, polymer science, and technique   of organic laboratories have been designed. At least 60 undergraduate   students per semester and 50 graduate students will have hands-on access   to the mass spectrometer as part of the routine training and research   regimen. This system is capable of protein sequencing and mass   spectrometric characterization of peptides, proteins, DNA, RNA,   oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, synthetic polymers, triglyceride   molecules and vegetable oils. In addition, the instrument will enhance   the research activities in the newly established polymer science program,   which primarily focused on the syntheses and characterization of   biodegradable and biocompatible polymer systems.  Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technique used to probe intimate structural   details and to obtain the molecular compositions of a vast array of   organic, bioorganic, and organometallic molecules. The addition of the   technique of electrospray extends the range of MS to protein and nucleic   acid molecular weights far beyond any other technique. The use of   electrospray ionization in combination with high resolution provides the   latest technique available in mass spectrometry. It affords the chemist   one of the most powerful tools available for the characterization of   compounds. The acquisition of this capability in mass spectrometry is   essential for the prosecution of frontier research in many fields of   chemistry.",
