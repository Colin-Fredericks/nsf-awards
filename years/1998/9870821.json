 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nDBI 9870821; Gabriel, Michael; University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign\r\n\r\nMuch current knowledge about brain function is based on analyses of the firing patterns of \r\nneurons. This field is experiencing an explosion of data. Huge data sets are being amassed \r\nwith new computer-based data acquisition systems and techniques for recording \r\nsimultaneously from multiple neurons and brain sites. Neural modeling generates large \r\nsimulated data sets that must be analyzed and compared smith experimental data. The goal \r\nof this project is to develop an information system for all aspects of neuronal data \r\nmanagement, including storage, retrieval, analysis, visualization and sharing of \r\nexperimental and simulated data. The ultimate aim is to develop a set of tools, techniques \r\nand standards that can be disseminated to help meet the needs of a large community of \r\nneuroscientists who work with neuronal data.\r\n\r\nNeuronal recordings can be intra-, or extracellular recordings of single spikes, ensembles \r\nof neurons and field potentials. Researchers correlate neuronal activity with other time-\r\nvarying signals such as stimuli and ongoing behavior. All of these data are instances of \r\ngeneral data type, namely time-series data. The proposed information svstem will be \r\nspecialized for neuronal time-series data. This focus is complementary to efforts of other \r\ngroups to develop neuroscience information systems in domains such as molecular \r\nneurobiology and functional brain imaging, which primarily deal with sequence and \r\nimage data.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of the project is to provide a system of general utility to \r\nneuroscientists. In its current scope, the project involves the laboratories of ten facultv of \r\nthe Universitv of Illinois/Beckman Institute Neuronal Pattern Analysis (NPA) Group, \r\nWhich can be viewed as a prototype of the larger community of neuroscientists that will \r\nbenefit from this effort. In addition the project will continue to be guided by resident \r\ncolleagues of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), and working \r\nassociations have been formed with related projects and individual researchers to \r\nincorporate a broad set of data handling conventions and requirements. The basic \r\ncomponents of the proposed svstem have either reached or are well on the way toward \r\ncompletion. These include: a) a database component for organized storage and efficient \r\nsearch and retrieval of neuronal data meeting specified criteria of interest; b) digital brain \r\natlases, to provide high-resolution neuroanatomical images for use in entering, retrieving \r\nand analyzing time series data; c) the time series data protocol (TSDP), a standard for \r\nrepresentation, transfer and analysis of time series data in a platform-independent manner. \r\nd) a suite of flexible and intuitive tools for data analysis and visualization, as vvrell as a \r\nprogramming library for development of TSDP-compliant tools which will be \r\ninteroperable within the research community.\r\n\r\nThe database component has been implemented using a generalized database table \r\nschema, allowing multiple laboratories to develop custom interfaces that work with a \r\nshared database system. Digital fish and rabbit brain atlases have been assembled and an \r\ninterface is being prepared to integrate the atlases with the database and analysis \r\nfunctions. The atlases will be supplied to several researchers, and exportation of TSDP to \r\nother projects is planned to promote full interoperability of multiple neuronal data sets and \r\npowerful time-series analysis and visualization tools. Development of TSDP is near \r\ncompletion and will be field tested by on-site and external researchers. Powerful \r\ncommercial, public domain and custom tools have been harnessed for data analysis and \r\nvisualization, and a modular programming library is being developed to render near and \r\nexisting tools TSDP-compliant and therefore widely interoperable in the research \r\ncommunity. \r\n\r\nThe system will meet the needs of neuroscientists at several levels. It can serve as a \r\npersonal database management system for individual laboratories, a \"workgroup\" tool for \r\nexchange of data within communities and as a means to implement an Internet-accessible \r\n\u00capublic\u00cb database. Steps remaining for full operational status are: a) completion and \r\nimplementation of TSDP; b) integration of digital brain atlases erith data-entry, query-\r\ndevelopment and with analysis and visualization tools; c) activation to full on-line status \r\nof NPA pilot laboratories; d) completion of the programming library for developing \r\nTSDP-compatible analysis and visualization tools. These steps will be carried out within \r\nan ongoing cycle of performance testing, evaluation and improvement.\r\n\r\n",
