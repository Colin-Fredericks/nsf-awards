The switch architecture is based on free-space separation of the wavelength channels using bulk lenses and gratings and on spatial switching using silicon micromachined mirror arrays.  Optical modeling of the switch predicts low insertion loss, low cross talk, flat pass band, and low polarization sensitivity.  Existing WDM crossbar switches are limited to two input and two output ports, while the proposed switch is scaleable to large port numbers providing dramatically enhanced flexibility in configuring complex network topologies owing to numerous switched path options obtainable in a single switching package.  The proposed switch is fabricated using silicon integrated circuit technology and it can be miniaturized for easy packaging.  These traits leads to potentially low-cost production and installation.    The design space for the proposed switch is investigated using Gaussian beam propagation.  Based on this investigation, a design of a 3x3 switch using standard optics and standard micromachining technology is developed.  This design will be built as a proof-of-principle demonstration. The analysis of the diffractive characteristics of the proposed switch shows that switches with larger number of ports require micromirrors with large and continuously-controllable angular deflection.  Development of such mirrors using a combination of analytical, numerical and experimental tools is proposed.  Finally it is shown that the proposed switch can be miniaturized and integrated on a silicon chip.  The integration technology will be developed and an integrated WDM crossbar switch will be created.    The educational aspects of this proposal are focused on course development and on the establishment of an industrially sponsored undergraduate research program.  The first course that is under development is an undergraduate optoelectronics laboratory  course, and the second is a graduate course on MEMS device physics and design.  The objective of these courses is to build a foundation for an experimentally oriented program in optoetectronic integration and fabrication.  To further integrate teaching and research in electrooptics, the establishment of an undergraduate research program is proposed.  The objectives and requirements of the research projects will be defined by industrial sponsors.  The research will be carried out by a team of undergraduate researchers under the guidance of a faculty member in close collaboration with industrial partners.  Funds for a start-up period for this program is requested.  The program will become selfsustaining by the end of the proposal period.  ***",
