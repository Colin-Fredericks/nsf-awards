 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810359  Orlin  This grant provides funding to develop, implement, and experimentally test a new neighborhood search heuristic for solving a broad class of partitioning  problems.  These partitioning problems are typically characterized by a two-phase decision process. In the first phase, a set of objects is partitioned into clusters; in the second phase, each cluster is sequenced or configured optimally. The decision problem is to partition the set of objects into clusters so that the sum of the costs of optimal configurations within clusters is minimum.  Examples of partitioning problems include: vehicle routing problems, multi-facility location problems, clustering problems in statistics, parallel machine scheduling problems, telecommunications network design problems, nurse scheduling, exam scheduling, and various other scheduling problems.  This grant will develop the cyclic exchange neighborhood search technique.  Neighborhood search techniques seek out improvements in a solution by making small changes to the solution.  In the cyclic exchange neighborhood approach, items may shifted between multiple clusters. Algorithmic approaches, analyses, test cases, and software will be developed and will be made freely available to other researchers via the World Wide Web.  Algorithm animations will be provided to help users visualize algorithms.  In addition, outside users will be able to submit problems for solution at the web site.  If successful, the results of this research will lead to more effective heuristic algorithms for solving several types of partitioning problems. Moreover, this research will provide a unified approach for solving partitioning problems that can be specialized to various problem types easily. Many of the subroutines for this generic approach can be reused. The web site will also provide  software, algorithm animations, and test cases that will facilitate the development of algorithms for partitioning problems by other researchers.  ***",
