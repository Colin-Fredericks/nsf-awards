 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is a comparative study of the factors influencing women's and men's entry into marriage and cohabitation over the past 30 years in the United States, Canada, Sweden, and Italy. It will analyze the effects of school enrollment, educational attainment, labor force participation, labor force experience, the earnings potential of women and men, and the occurrence of pregnancy and/or the presence of children on union formation. The study will determine how the availability of alternative forms of union (cohabitation and marriage), along with shifts in the lives of men and women, have altered traditional patterns of union formation across cohorts and among nations. The study will use newly available comparative data from the \"Fertility and Family Surveys\" of these nations between 1993 and 1995. Event history analyses will be employed, treating cohabitation and marriage as competing alternative outcomes, with fixed and time-varying independent variables measured at the individual and social institutional level. This research will contribute to a clearer understanding of the likely trajectory of this transformation in family life. A key theoretical concern is how compositional changes in the life histories women and men bring to union formation, on the cohort-specific roles and potentialities of women and men (absolutely and relative to each other), and changes in the process of union formation have contributed to this change in family life. An important concern for better understanding marriage as an institution is the project's analysis of how the determinants of marriage have changed with the rise in cohabitation, as an alternative union type. The research is of policy concern because of the changing role of children (already born or impending births) in the union formation process, and what this implies for the presence of a father or father-figure in the households and for family economic well-being and welfare dependence.\r\n\r\n",
