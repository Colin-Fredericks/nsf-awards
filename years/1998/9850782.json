 "awd_abstract_narration": "Students in Kinesiology, in preparation for graduate study or careers in Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Exercise Science and related fields must become adept in the analysis of human movement. The ability to analyze human movement requires a solid foundation in basic science. Such a foundation contributes to a thorough understanding of the biomechanical factors that concern movement organization and is essential for an appreciation of movement in the context of human behavior. This project is developing a model computer-based laboratory and a progression of laboratory exercises that facilitate the development of skill in quantitative movement analysis and which fosters an understanding of biomechanical concepts. Using the latest multimedia equipped PCs and custom designed software, students perform kinematic and kinetic analyses of movement sequences captured on videotape or collected via electrogoniometers. Because the software allows integration of video images, stick figures, and parameter plots, movements can be \"brought to life\" and a much deeper conceptual understanding of the mechanical bases of human movement can be developed. A progression of labs that increase in sophistication and difficulty is being established within and across courses in the Kinesiology curriculum. Distribution of our software, model data sets, and laboratory exercises via CD-ROM and the World Wide Web provides an invaluable service to Kinesiology students everywhere. Furthermore, this project provides an innovative model for any curriculum involved in the analysis of biological motion.",
