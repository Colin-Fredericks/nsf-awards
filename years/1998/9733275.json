 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733275  Huang    This proposal aims to develop solid-state synthetic routes to a  new generation of borophosphate-based second-order nonlinear  optical (NLO) materials with superior optical properties (large  NLO coefficients, high optical damage thresholds, lower  absorption cutoffs, and phase matching at shorter wavelengths).  Crystal engineering strategies will be used to produce novel  supramolecular NLO host-guest assemblies derived from metal-  organic coordination polymers and NLO-active organic  chromophores. Because of the robust, infinite structures  provided by polymeric inorganic host matrices, such materials  may have enhanced mechanical, thermal and temporal stability,  critical properties that have hampered commercial application of  many otherwise promising organic molecule-based NLO materials.    The education plan is centered on developing a coherent program  for offering education and technical training in materials  chemistry at both undergraduate and graduate levels, and on  increasing Hispanic minority participation in chemistry.  A  materials chemistry laboratory course for upper-level  undergraduate students will  focus on strengthening the teaching  of solid-state and materials chemistry for chemistry majors,  thus better preparing the them for tomorrow's job market.  Talented Hispanic students at the undergraduate level will be  provided research experience and encouraged to pursue research  careers in materials chemistry. This plan is anticipated to have  a direct impact on the nation by increasing the number of highly  trained and well-qualified Hispanic scientists.  %%%  The proposed research is aimed at synthesizing novel nonlinear  optical (NLO) materials for applications such as optical  switching, information storage, and laser frequency conversion  related to technology areas that include telecommunications and  computing. Furthermore,  the design and synthesis of new classes  of optical materials may lead not only to further technological  innovations in these  areas, but also to totally new  technologies.  This integrated research and education program  will educate and train students to better compete for job  opportunities in these fast-breaking areas.  ***",
