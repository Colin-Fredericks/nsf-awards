 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733837  Sheares    Synthesis and Characterization of Poly(N,N-dialkylaminoisoprene)s    This CAREER award will exploit a new synthetic route developed in  our laboratory for the synthesis of N,N-dialkylaminoisoprene  monomers to produce functionalized homopolymers and copolymers.  The polymer polarity, in addition to the potential for  quaternization and crosslinking, will be utilized to produce  materials of both scientific interest and industrial utility.  Potential applications include new cationic polyisoprene-based  elastomers and new polymer blends.  Additionally, there is  potential for the poly(N,N-dialkylaminoisoprene)s to be used in  the modification of existing materials such as polystyrene-  polybutadiene rubber.  Changes in adhesion, processability,  solubility, microstructure, morphology, thermal and mechanical  properties will lead to tailor-made products.  In this research,  a fundamental understanding of the behavior of polar, diene  monomers in anionic, free radical solution and free radical  emulsion polymerization processes will also be gained.  %%%  The goals for this project are not only scientific, but are also  educational.  These include the training of graduate students and  the teaching of undergraduates and high school students.  Specifically, graduate students will design and synthesize  materials using a structure-property approach.  Undergraduates  and high school student researchers will examine intriguing,  practical problems that can be answered with this chemistry.  Multidisciplinary collaboration with engineers, material  scientists, and other chemists will be an additional educational  experience for students.  Finally, it is expected that the  research results will be incorporated, where appropriate, into  the teaching of undergraduate and graduate courses to help  students appreciate the utility of basic concepts . This project,  a combination of scientific research and educational training,  should have a significant impact in the area of tailor-made,  fu nctionalized materials. In the process, students will gain  excellent technical and creative skills in the field of materials  science.  ***",
