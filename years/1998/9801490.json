Warren      The last three years of research on the bronzed cowbird  (Molothrusaeneus)have uncovered a social system that differs  in many important ways from other birds.  This project will  attempt to determine what effects these differences have on  their evolution.  Songs of male bronzed cowbirds will be  recorded and compared among different populations.  Songs  will also be played back to male cowbirds to determine what  variation in song means to the birds.    As brood parasites, cowbirds possess an unusual form of  reproduction;  the female cowbird lays her eggs in the nests  of other bird species who then raise her offspring as if it  were their own.  The effects of brood parasitism on the  cowbirds' host species have been much publicized and much  debated.  But what are the evolutionary consequences for the  cowbirds themselves?  One consequence is that male cowbirds  do not have the  opportunity to learn their songs until they leave their  foster parents and join their own species.  Thus, their  opportunities for learning are constrained in a way unlike  that in other species.  What role does song learning play in  evolutionary processes like speciation?  To address this  problem, this study asks whether groups of cowbirds which  have been separate from one other are likely to split into  different species.  It is hoped that information gathered on  this little-studied species of cowbird will contribute to a  general understanding of its behavior, its use of habitat,  and therefore its potential to impacts on other species.",
