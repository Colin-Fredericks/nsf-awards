 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project develops a general framework for the  design of a new generation of high performance robust  control algorithms, their integration in actual sensor and  controllers, and application of the integrated design to  control electro-hydraulic servo-systems and linear motor  driven high-speed/high-accuracy positioning systems. The  controllers combine the positive features of both adaptive  control and robust control, and their implementation leads  to high performance and energy-saving in hydraulic machines  such as those developed by Caterpillar, Inc. an industry  with which the PI has developed a collaborative research  relationship. The education plan includes the integration of  proposed research in existing control courses; involvement  of undergraduate and graduate students in research;  developing continuing education and short courses for  practicing engineers to facilitate technology transfer; and  development of two new courses--one at the undergraduate and  the other at graduate level. The project is aimed towards  developing a solid foundation for designing high performance  robust controllers to meet the industrial needs for high  productivity and high quality products, and introduce to the  engineering students and practicing engineers a strong  analytical background in this area.",
