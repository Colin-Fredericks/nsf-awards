 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project plans to enhance undergraduate laboratory instruction in Psychobiology and Animal Learning. The project seeks to improve the competence of students in using modern computer technologies as research tools, and to expand opportunities for hands-on learning and independent research by students using computer-based teaching technology. This will be accomplished by establishing two interrelated laboratories.     A new Psychobiology laboratory will enable students to conduct research covering a broad array of integrative brain-behavior questions using contemporary methodology. Planned experiments include examination of vertebrate neuroanatomy, the behavioral effects of direct alterations of central nervous system activity through brain lesions, drug administration, and electrical brain stimulation, and development of computerized behavioral recording and analysis techniques.     This project also includes a substantial upgrading of our Animal Learning laboratory through modernization of operant equipment and computers. This will permit greater student exposure to diverse experimental designs, and will promote development of skills using state-of-the-art computer-based research technology including programming of computerized data collection procedures. Planned experiments include standard operant conditioning experiments such as shaping, schedules of reinforcement, and discrimination with emphasis on observational techniques and data analysis.     Together, these laboratory improvements will expand the current curriculum by providing the equipment necessary for the desired level of scholarship thus contributing to efforts toward preparing students for the increasing technical and intellectual challenges that they will encounter in the future. Furthermore, the enhancement of the current curriculum will attract talented students to careers in science and will promote science literacy in general among Psychology majors.",
