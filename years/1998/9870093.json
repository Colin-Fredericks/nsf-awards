 "awd_abstract_narration": "A short-course will be offered whose primary focus is to assist faculty in gaining experience and knowledge about instructional strategies and procedures to improve the undergraduate educational experience of students in the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) with engineering programs.  The short-course is modeled after a National Science Foundation (NSF) faculty enhancement course at the United States Military Academy (USMA).    The project is based on the premise of adaptation adoption to promote the use of good ideas in an environment that recognizes the need for such a program.  The result will be a broader exposure to teacher training by engineering professors and, it is hoped, a faster growth in the dedication to teaching at all affected institutions of higher learning.    The project is intended to support the need of a separate and distinct teacher training program at the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) with engineering programs, to demonstrate the ability to operate such a course at Tuskegee University, and the ability to adopt much of the program that was so successful at the United States Military Academy at West Point.",
