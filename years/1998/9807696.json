The interfaces in multiphase materials, such as those in  composites, coatings, nano- and electronic materials play an  important role in determining the physical properties of those  systems.  Since the interfaces themselves are quite thin, and as  the size of structures is reduced, the effects of the interfaces  become even more difficult to properly characterize with  macroscopic physical testing.  Spectroscopic techniques,  especially deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), will be  used to study the microscopic properties of the polymers at  interfaces with solid substrates.  The use of deuterium labelling  is important because specific deuteration is not a significant  perturbation of the segmental motion of the polymer-the deuterons  act as reporter groups based on their position which is  synthetically controlled.  The focus will be on the dynamics  (i.e. molecular motion) of polymer segments.  Segmental motion  has not been studied as much as the structures of the interfacial  species; however, both determine the ultimate properties of the  systems used.    This work builds on work previously funded by NSF where deuterium  NMR has been shown to be a powerful tool for probing the motions  of adsorbed polymers.  For homopolymers adsorbed on solid  surfaces, a motional gradient in a single-molecule thick film has  been identified.  However, the characterization of this  gradient/layer was incomplete.  It is proposed that experiments  on composite materials, where the labelled polymer is adsorbed on  the solid substrate and an unlabelled polymer is absorbed over  it, be performed.  These will identify how the presence of an  overlayer affects the interfacial layer.  With the sensitivity of  the NMR instrumentation available, it is also proposed that two-  dimensional exchange NMR experiments be performed in order to  quantitatively estimate the  rates and amounts of different  motional species present in the interfacial polymers.  %%%  The result of the successful completion of this work will be that  knowledge of the structure and dynamics of interfacial materials  will help researchers to design interfacial systems with enhanced  properties for advanced applications such as advanced composite  structures, electronic devices, particle stabilization, and  adhesive properties.  ***",
