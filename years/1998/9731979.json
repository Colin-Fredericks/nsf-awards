 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effects of economic integration on competition and welfare have been of interest to economists for some time. For anyone interested in these issues, the European automobile industry during the 1980s and 1990s provides a unique study experiment. The industry has been characterized by significant internal and external trade barriers, many of which were eliminated in 1992. Issues of market power and labor rents seem a priori important, given the oligopolistic structure of the sector and the presence of unions. In addition, car prices in European countries are characterized by large and persistent differences across countries, that are often viewed as the result of market segmentation and price discriminating practices. Empirically, the price dispersion in the European market coincides with large exchange rate movements and substantial, evolving cross country differences in value added taxes, botch of which are bound to be affected by the process of economic integration.  The purpose of this project is to shed light on these issues and estimate the effects of various aspects of economic integration, using detailed data on prices, characteristics, market shares and production location of all available car models in seven European countries over the period 1980   1996. Contrary to previous studies that employed a calibration approach, this study is based on econometric estimates of the relevant parameters. This research proceeds in three steps. The first is to carry out a descriptive analysis to document the basic patterns in the price data and relate them to factors such as exchange and tax rates, demographic characteristics, and trade restrictions, using a reduced form approach. A question of particular interest is whether prices across European countries appear to converge over time, as European integration progresses and the year for the European Monetary Union approaches.  The second step is to estimate a structural model of oligopoly with product differentiation, to obtain the demand and cost parameters required in policy simulations and welfare calculations. The model incorporates exchange rate fluctuations, tax differences, and multicountry production. Apart from forming the basis for the simulations, the structural framework offers the advantage of providing estimates of the unobserved marginal costs and markups in the industry. These estimates are required in order to address the effects of economic integration on competition.  The third step in the analysis is to use the estimated structural model parameters in simulations to investigate the effects of various aspects of economic integration on welfare in European countries. The four main aspects of integration are: (a) removal of internal tariff barriers, (b) tax harmonization, (c) transition to a common currency, and (d) elimination of market segmentation and price discrimination.",
