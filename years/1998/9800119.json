SCOPE has the following objectives:  (1) to advance  knowledge of (a) the influence of humans on their environment and (b) the effects of environmental changes upon people, their health, and their welfare, particularly those influences and effects that are either global or are shared by several nations; and (2)  to serve as a council of scientists acting as a source of advice to governments and intergovernmental bodies on issues concerning the environment. This award provides for the U.S. scientists who serve on the U.S. National Committee for SCOPE, and supporting staff at NAS, to continue their involvement in the five broad international issues on which SCOPE currently focuses are:  sustainability, biogeochemical cycles, global change, ecosystems and biodiversity, and health and ecotoxicology.  A major thrust for the U.S. National Committee for the next several years is the linking of natural and social science components of environmental problems.                                                        \u00a4\u00cd",
