 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725934  Low, Philip S.    The oxidative burst constitutes an important early defense mechanism linked to disease resistance in plants.  The burst response is characterized by the rapid synthesis of highly reactive oxygen compounds (superoxide or hydrogen peroxide) within minutes after stimulation of the plant cell by pathogens or pathogen-generated elicitor molecules.  Because this oxygen burst is found throughout the plant kingdom, and since it may be a critical component of several plant defense mechanisms, its detailed characterization is of considerable importance and interest.  The overall goal of this project is to elucidate the signal transduction pathway that is activated when an elicitor binds to a cell surface or cytoplasmic receptor and which culminates when the oxidase enzyme complex is assembled and activated to produce the burst of reactive oxygen.  The specific aims are (a) to characterize a specific elicitor-activated protein kinase that initiates the response to oligogalacturonic acid, (b) to determine the timing of activation of possible intermediate components (G-proteins, Ca++, phospholipase C, other protein kinases) that relay the resulting signal to the oxidase to activate it, and (c) to clone the genes for both the kinase and several of the oxidase subunits.  Completion of these objectives will greatly enhance our understanding of the specific signal transduction processes that lead to the oxidative burst and will provide insights into general principles of signal transduction strategies in plant cells.  One practical extension of this work is that if the oxidative burst can be engineered to respond more rapidly or to a wider range of pathogens, reliance on toxic pesticides in agriculture could be reduced.",
