 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712885  Nelson  The senior PI, in recent years, has been involved in (a) the  development of a Lagrangian formulation of long wavelength  phenomena in dielectric crystals, (b) using this formulation  to derive and elucidate high-order nonlinear interactions  and correcting widely held long standing misconceptions in  classical theories and (c) incorporation of magnetic  phenomena in his formulation using Grassmann algebra of  anticommuting variables.  This grant continues to support  his work following a string of successes in the previous  award.  This grant also includes work on a generalized  energy conservation law and a new Poynting vector, followed  by application to the properties of an optical soliton.  %%%  This senior PI is well known for his contributions to Laser  Physics.  In this renewal grant, he continues his work on a  sophisticated mathematical  formulation of electromagnetic  wave propagation in an insulating material.  In this renewal  he specifically wants to generalize the formulation to  include magnetic properties of materials.  ***",
