 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is being done in conjunction with IIS-9731990, which is being\r\nperformed by Michael Pazzani in the Information and Computer Science\r\nDepartment at the University of California, Irvine. The research is\r\nconcerned with intelligent decision aids that can be developed by data\r\nmining techniques.  Experience has determined that such systems can learn\r\naccurate models,  but that experts in areas where those models are used in\r\ndecision aids are often reluctant to trust them because they do not, for\r\ninstance, use the same tests intermediate conclusions or abstractions that\r\nthe experts have grown to trust.  Or they do not use certain factors at all\r\nthat experts feel to be relevant.  Experts also want models that are stable\r\nunder small changes in the data being analyzed.  Psychologists have\r\ndiscovered factors that simplify the learning, understanding, and\r\ncommunication of category and process information by humans.  This research\r\nseeks to explore these psychological principles in light of the output of\r\nexisting KDD algorithms and then go on to develop and evaluate new KDD\r\nalgorithms that will provide output that is easy for people to learn , use,\r\nand communicate to others. With the results of this research, it should be\r\npossible to make such decision aids more \"human centered\", so that they\r\nwill be used more often and more effectively in practice.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gatech.edu/psychology/faculty.htm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
