 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870784  HALFTER   In the developing nervous system, axons must  often establish contact with specific targets by complicated  routes.  Despite considerable progress in understanding how axons  make navigational choices, the mechanisms and molecular components  that can precisely account for the specificity of axonal wiring  are still largely unknown.  In the current project, Dr. Halfter  plans to continue his research on the question of how optic axons  from the eye are guided to grow towards the optic disc and cross  to the other side of the brain at the optic chiasm, and from  there, to form synapses with the correct parts of the tectum,  their initial target in the brain.  Previous work in Dr. Halfter's  laboratory has shown that membrane and extracellular matrix  proteins on cells in the path of growing retinal axons are likely  to act as intermediary targets.  They have recently isolated an  unknown cell-surface protein called the ID10 antigen which is a  candidate guidance molecule.  The first goal of the new research  will be to molecularly identify this protein and characterize its  function in axon guidance.  A second aim of this research is to  investigate how gradients of substances that either attract or  repel growing axons can precisely guide axonal growth.  For this  aim, Dr. Halfter has developed an in vitro system for producing  gradients of suspected attractive or repellent molecules.  The  third part of this project will take a molecular approach to  identifying new candidate molecules for axonal guidance by their  differential expression in retinal ganglion cells from different  locations in the eye.  These studies will contribute to a general  understanding of the mechanisms of axon guidance, and provide new  methodology for assaying the effects of candidate molecules.",
