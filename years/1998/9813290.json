Aspray, William  Computing Research Association    Special Project: Evaluation and Institutionalization of the CRA Distributed Mentor Project    The goal of this project is to increase the number of women entering graduate programs in CISE areas by providing opportunities for women undergraduates to be involved in research projects with female mentors at major research universities so as to experience research and graduate life. This goal is in accord with the need to increase the number of women in responsible, high-level positions in CISE areas. The project provides support for twenty-two women undergraduates in each of three years to work with experienced and qualified mentors during summer months. In addition, the project includes a significant evaluation component, a plan for dissemination of the results of the evaluation and a plan for working toward long-term funding and institutionalization of the project.",
