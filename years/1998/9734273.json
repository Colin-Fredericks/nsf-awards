 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported by the   Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focuses on very fundamental   studies of the behavior of water at electrochemical interfaces.    Professor Borguet and his students at the University of Pittsburgh will   use optical second harmonic generation (SHG) and sum frequency generation   methods to probe the orientation, structure, and dynamics of the   interfacial water layer at metal electrode interfaces.  The respective   roles of electrolyte concentration and electrode potential will be   evaluated.  This CAREER project will seek to improve science literacy for   non-science majors by developing a unified course inclusive of most of   the science disciplines.  Outreach to high school students will be   undertaken by Professor Borguet through greater use of modern   instrumentation in the University of Pittsburgh Chemistry Van Program.  The interaction of water with metallic surfaces is of great technological   importance, but is still not well understood on a fundamental level.    Professor Borguet and his students at the University of Pittsburgh will   use a suite of optical techniques to study the physical structure of   water molecules at electrode surfaces.  This CAREER project provides   graduate students with a system which intimately ties fundamental   chemical reactivity with a topic of great technological importance;   corrosion.  Professor Borguet will make contributions to improving the   scientific literacy of non-science majors through curriculum development   and capturing the interest of high school students through participation   in the University of Pittsburgh Chemistry Van Program.",
