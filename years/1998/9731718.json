 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731718  Peterson  Soft-bottom benthic habitats represent one of the most  ubiquitous environments within the marine ecosystem;  however, our knowledge of the processes which determine  species abundance and distribution pales in comparison to  other types of benthic systems. The majority of past  research in benthic systems has focused on the role of  predation, disturbance, and competition on adult benthic  populations. Recent attention to the potential role of  larval supply and the entire recruitment process has greatly  expanded our knowledge of the processes which structure  benthic communities. Nevertheless, for soft-bottom  communities, one large, critical gap exists in our  knowledge, the role of secondary movement or redispersal of  organisms following larval recruitment. Through a series of  field and laboratory experiments designed to address this  topic, research will focus on two objectives: to quantify  and describe the secondary movement of selected marine  benthic macro-invertebrates, particularly juveniles, and to  determine the role secondary movement has in structuring  soft-bottom communities and mediating interactions of other  processes. Research will focus on three common estuarine  benthic invertebrates which vary in their dispersal  abilities and include two bivalves and one polychate worm.  The research will involve direct examination of these  organisms in situ and will include a characterization of the  hydrodymanic regimes. Research on the interaction of habitat  structure, predators and density dependence on secondary  dispersion is planned. The results will add knowledge to a  poorly understood aspect of the factors which influence  community structure and function in soft-bottom benthic  environments.",
