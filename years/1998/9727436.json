The prototypic  neurotrophin, nerve growth factor (NGF), acts through a signaling  pathway termed the \"MAP kinase (MAPK) cascade\".  The MAPK  cascadeincludes a group of enzymes  known as serine/threonine  kinases (and referred to as members of the \"raf\" family), as well  as other enymes (kinases) that are serially activated. The present  application is focused on understanding how the kinases which  comprise this cascade convey signals (the presence of growth  factors outside the cell) from the membrane to target areas in the  cytoplasm and nucleus which are essential for neuronal  differentiation.       In the previous grant period we have demonstrated that NGF  treatment of a line of cultured cells, known as \"PC12 cells\"  resulted in the activation of two raf family members, B-raf and c-  raf.  However, only B-raf was mechanistically linked to the  activation of the MAPK cascade.  We have found that the capacity  to drive the MAPK cascade is correlated with the ability of B-raf,  but not c-raf, to form a stable complex with the heat shock  protein, HSP90.  We hypothesize that HSP90 is a component of a  molecular scaffold which serves to physically organize the MAPK  cascade into a functional module.       The first specific aim of this proposal is to establish the  identity of the G-proteins (a class of protein in cell membranes  which is involved in the transmission of chemical messages from  the outside to the inside of a cell) which initiate activation of  the MAPK cascade in PC12 cells.  The involvement of newly  discovered G-proteins in this process will be investigated.  The  action of the second member of the MAPK cascade, B-raf, will be  explored through expression (activation of a gene in cultured  cells) of a dominant neg ative B-raf molecule which blocks the  action of the endogenous B-raf.  These experiments will allow  determination of the roles of these molecules in mediating NGF  action.  We will also investigate whether the MAPK cascade is  physically organized as a signaling module.       Finally, the PC12 cells are a widely used neuronal model,  however, a variety of data suggest that signaling events in these  cells may not accurately reflect those occurring in authentic  neurons.  We propose to investigate the cellular mechanisms  subserving the activation of the MAPK cascade in these primary  neurons.      1",
