The III-VI materials comprise two principal classes:  layered materials, such as GaSe and InSe, and cubic materials  such as Ga2Se3 and In2Se3, which are being investigated as  prototype systems for heteroepitaxy of dissimilar materials and  as possible novel materials for electronic or optoelectronic  devices. Both classes of III-VI materials have bandgaps in the  optical range and chemical compatibility with more traditional  electronic materials. The structure of III-VI semiconductors  gives them highly anisotropic transport, mechanical and optical  properties and large non-linear susceptibilities. Specific goals  are: to determine growth mechanisms for GaSe, Ga2Se3 and related  materials by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE); to determine the role  of substrate interactions and surface bond character in  controlling the nucleation and growth of GaxSey compounds; to  establish an experimental and theoretical framework for  determining the appropriate growth conditions to obtain optimal  structural, electronic and optical properties in III-VI  materials; to evaluate the feasibility of using these materials  for novel opto-electronic applications through analysis of  fundamental structural, electronic and optical properties. The  approach is to concentrate on the nucleation and growth of GaSe  and Ga2Se3 on Si, GaAs, CaF2 and A1203, and on the properties of  the resultant thin films. A combination of in situ and ex situ  experimental probes including photoelectron spectroscopy and  diffraction, electron diffraction, optical spectroscopy, atomic  force microscopy, and high resolution transmission electron  microscopy in combination with kinetic modeling of the growth  process will be employed. The role of ionicity in the substrate,  the degree of surface passivation, and the inherent lattice  mismatch with the overlayer will be varied among t he four  materials.  %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high potential technological relevance.  The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at  a fundamental level to new aspects of electronic/photonic  devices.  Experimental tools are now available to allow atomic  level observation of elementary surface processes which when  better understood allow advances in fundamental science and  technology. The basic knowledge and understanding gained from the  research is expected to contribute to improving the performance  and stability of advanced devices and circuits by providing a  fundamental understanding and a basis for designing and producing  improved materials, and materials combinations.  An important  feature of the program is the integration of research and  education through the training of students in a fundamentally and  technologically significant area.  ***",
