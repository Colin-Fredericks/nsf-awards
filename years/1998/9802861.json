The 1998 workshop will be held in Park City, Utah, with  Brigham Young University acting as host, with Professor David G. Wright as  the local organizer, and with Professor Steven C. Ferry of SUNY-Binghamton  as the principal lecturer.  The 1999 workshop will be held at University  of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and the 2000 workshop will be held at Colorado  College.  These workshops belong to a well established series that began  in the 1980's.       Geometric topology treats the structure and properties of low-  dimensional topological manifolds.  Previous workshops in this series  have focused on such major developments in the field as the solution of  the knot-complement problem by Andrew Casson and John Luecke.  The  principal lectures on that occasion (1989) were given by Luecke, whose  solution confirmed the conjecture that a knot in 3-dimensional space is  completely determined by its complement (the residual space  remaining after a worm has eaten its way along the knot, leaving a knot-  shaped tunnel behind).  The workshops' primary goal is to provide  mathematicians with active research programs but limited support an  opportunity to discuss their work with others in the field.  Another  important goal is to expand the interests of the participants by having  a nationally recognized expert discuss an area that is related to, but  outside, the focus of their current work.  A third goal is to provide a  serious but informal research atmosphere in which gradate students in  geometric topology can meet and learn from others in the field.  ***",
