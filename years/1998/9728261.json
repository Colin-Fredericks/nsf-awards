 "awd_abstract_narration": "97-28261  Papadopoulos    The specific interactions of steroids with binding sites in the brain together with the rapid effects of various steroids on neuronal function has prompted the investigation of the steroidogenic potential of central nervous system structures.  Indeed recent evidence indicates that the brain could function as an independent endocrine organ similar to the steroid synthesizing organs of the body (e.g. gonads, adrenals, placenta).  These steroids hormones produced by the brain are termed \"neurosteroids\".  Neurosteroids, such as pregnenolone and DHEA (dehyroepiandrosterone)  have been shown to control neuronal development, aging, communication, and regulate numerous neuroendocrine and behavioral functions, including learning and memory.  While there is strong evidence that pregnenolone is indeed synthesized by specific cells in the brain, there is little data on local synthesis of  DHEA .  Dr. Papadopoulos has found that glial cells are capable of synthesizing DHEA, the actual mechanism is different than reported in peripheral tissues.  Dr. Papadoupoulos will now fully examine the local synthesis of DHEA in the brain.  He will look for changes of the brain levels of both DHEA and pregnenolone over development and aging, and determine how gender affects the levels.  In addition, he will identify how these two neurosteroids are distributed in the brain and the factors that regulate their synthesis.  DHEA and pregnenolone are used today as over the counter medications and food supplements for enhancing the brain performance and prevent the onset of aging-related diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia.  More specifically, DHEA has been termed the \"fountain of youth\".  Understanding the fundamental mechanisms of DHEA and pregnenolone formation in the brain is paramount to all further speculation and hypotheses about DHEA and pregnenolone and their role in normal and pathologic brain function.",
