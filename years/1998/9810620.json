 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810620  Perdew    This award supports theoretical research on the properties  of atoms, molecules, and solids.  The proposed work focuses  on improving the methods and concepts of density functional  and pseudopotential theory.  Specific projects include: (1)  Incorporate the second derivative in the generalized  gradient expansion for the exchange correlation energy in a  way that recovers the fourth-order gradient expansion for  the exchange energy in the limit of slow or long-wavelength  density fluctuations. (2) Construct a similar \"Laplacian  level GGA\" for the kinetic energy. (3) Construct an electron-  ion pseudopotential that provides a correct description of  the interaction between core and valence electrons. (4)  Develop models based on the generalized gradient  approximation and beyond for the exchange-correlation hole.  (5) Study exchange and correlation in the low-density or  strongly-correlated limit. (6) Test various density  functionals for the quasi-two-dimensional electron gas or  quantum well to see if they satisfy one-dimensional density  scaling. (7) Propose a simplified equation of state for  solids. (8) Develop and test a fully nonlocal orbital  functional for the correlation energy, compatible with exact  exchange.  %%%  Perdew will use analytical and numerical techniques to  improve density-functional based  theories of materials and  of the electronic structure of atoms, molecules, and solids.  The work has potential to broadly impact research efforts as  well as simulation methods applied to a wide variety of  materials and phenomena that occur in materials.  ***",
