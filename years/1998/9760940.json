Present visors are prone to scratching and/or cannot tolerate direct flame impingement.  'Fire novel approach described in this proposal uses an open atmosphere CVD technique to apply an inexpensive, hard, flexible gold based silica thin film coating system to enhance the abrasion, flame resistance and overall duration and visual acuity of polymer based transparent visors.  The reflective properties of the gold should also show improvement in the IR reflective properties of the system.  mct' will determine the optimal coating system, which may be a nanolaminate, to provide the properties needed for face protective equipment.    All work will be based on previous coating development of metals, silica and other advanced materials using the open atmosphere CCVD process.  This process is both low cost and production friendly, and offers the capability to deposit high quality thin films onto large complex shapes for this application.  Silica and metal coatings have been successfully deposited onto polycarbonate substrates using CCVD processing at MCT.  A support letter from an industry leader in the development of protective equipment for firefighters is included in the proposal; the letter expresses a strong interest in the proposed approach.  ' 'he experience and skills of this company will be instruments  in attainment of the objectives of this project.    By developing a new coating process for transparent plastics, it is possible to extend the applications beyond optical coatings to light blocking applications, metallization of electronic packaging, compact discs and light weight wave guides, all of which can then use low density inexpensive bulk polymers.  Collectively, these areas present a multi-hundred million opportunity.  With recent Phase III funding from its first Phase 11, MCT has demonstrated the capability to effectively utilize SBIR fun ding.  ***",
