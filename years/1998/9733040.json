 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733040  Leonard  The objective of this career development plan is to foster  the interest of the next generation of students in the  special challenges and rewards of ocean engineering, while  advancing the state of knowledge in the critical areas of  sonar perception and navigation.  The realization of the  full potential of future ocean technologies will require new  engineers with the motivation to approach difficult marine  problems and an understanding of the complexities of ocean  system design.    Autonomous navigation using sensor measurements of  environmental features provides a compelling goal to focus  research in sonar perception and navigation.  Building a map  of an unknown environment while using that map to navigate  is a difficult problem at the frontier of robotics research.  Current data fusion methods are not robust or  computationally tractable for this problem.    To realize this capability for marine robotic systems using  sonar, three objectives will be pursued:  (1) feature  extraction methods which exploit knowledge of the underlying  physics of sonar, (2) uncertainty management techniques that  incorporate noise, data association ambiguity, and  navigation error, and (3) adaptive echolocation strategies  that permit efficient detection and characterization of  objects.  To investigate these topics, graduate and  undergraduate students will participate in algorithm  development, data acquisition and processing, and  experimentation in controlled environments.  Innovative  experiments that biomimic dolphin echolocation will be  performed in a testing tank at MIT.  Collaborations have  been established to provide maximum research impact.    The educational plan involves teaching and mentoring in  subject areas that are closely related to the research.  The  undergraduate teaching responsibilities of the principal  investigator include a sophomore-level introductory course  in ocean science and technology, a two semester capstone  design sequence, and a freshman advising  seminar based on  the sonar systems of bats, dolphins, and robots.  Innovations in pedagogy will promote active learning,  teamwork, and communication skills.  Case studies will guide  discussion of contemporary topics in oceanography,  acoustics, and design.  Novel laboratory exercises will  demonstrate principles from acoustics and marine robotics.  New Matlab-based tools will enable students to manipulate  ocean data.  ***",
