 "awd_abstract_narration": "9812089  Galvin    An ACS Symposium will be held March 29-April 2, 1998 on  semiconductive polymers covering several forefront research  topics; Ionically Conducting Polymers and Carbon Filled Polymers,  Conducting Polymers, Organic and Polymeric Materials for the  Fabrication of Thin Film Transistors, and Polymers for Light  Emitting Diodes. The goal of the symposium is to bring together  world leaders in the field of semiconductor polymers to discuss  the most recent developments. The symposium brings together  scientists who work on ionically and electronically conducting  polymers with scientists who study polymers for thin film  transistors and LEDs to promote cross-fertilization and  accelerate the pace of scientific advancement and  commercialization. An equally important objective of the  symposium is to bring together industrial and academic scientists  in an effort to encourage interaction/collaboration. Support from  NSF will be used to partially compensate young scientists (junior  faculty, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) for travel  and accommodation expenses. They will be active participants with  one-quarter of the presentations (talks and posters) being made  by students and postdoctoral fellows, and young faculty. The  conference is expected to provide an effective forum for  discussion of critical scientific issues in semiconductive  polymers. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and  future directions, it is expected that new ties will be  established between universities, research institutions, and  industry.  %%%   Semiconducting polymers have far reaching economic potential  since applications range from electroactive membranes and  electromagnetic shielding to the active element in transistors or  light emitting diodes (LEDs) for flat panel displays. An  evaluation of the progress and status of this field along with  current assessments of the most important developments will be of  great value to the understanding an d enhanced utilization of  these materials in applications beneficial to society.  ***",
