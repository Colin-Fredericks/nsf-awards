There is an  emphasis on materials that have an inter-relationship among their  crystallographic properties and their collective behaviors that are  manifested at room temperature and below.  To determine the intrinsic  physical properties, the research stresses experiments on high-quality  single crystals.  Two families form the core of these studies; namely,  spin  Peierls and spin gap compounds such as CuGeO3, CaV4O9 and derivative  compounds   and   colossal   magneto-resistive   compounds   such   as  (La,Ca,Bi)MnO3,  Eu14MnSb11   and   related  materials.   To  ensure  consistency   and  uniformity in  interpreting   the   experimental  results,   a   great   variety   of  complementary  experiments will be performed on the same single crystals.  %%%  This  experimental  research  program  focuses  on  two  families   of  materials  that  show  great  promise  for  technological  applications  and  are  associated  with distinctive magnetic properties; namely, spin gap and colossal  magneto-resistive (CMR) compounds.  Some examples are CuGeO3, CaV4O9,  (La,Bi)MnO3, and Eu14MnSb14.  These materials are attracting great  attention from the magnetic recording industry.  Due to the intrinsic  complexity  of  these  multi-component materials,  great  emphasis  is  placed on  using  the  highest  quality  crystals  in  this  study.   Goals  with  practical  aspects include:  elemental substitutions to optimize the performance  characteristics;  discovery of new materials  to  raise  the  critical  operating  temperatures of the CMR compounds.  ***",
