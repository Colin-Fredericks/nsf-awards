 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870390  Chang  A pilot study is supported under the POWRE program.  Its  purpose is twofold:  (1) to instrument a retaining wall to  estimate lateral earth pressures due to highway live loads  and (2) to develop the investigator's abilities in the areas  of geotechnical field instrumentation and analysis of field  data.    The purpose of the instrumentation array is to collect data  on the increase in lateral earth pressure and the response  of a retaining wall due to passing trucks.  At present,  there is little field data to corroborate the recommended  procedures prescribed in the 1994 AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design  Specifications and the 1996 AASHTO Standard Specifications  for Highway Bridges which are based on analytical work and  elastic theory.  This pilot study will provide a rare case  history for comparison to current analytical results and  test the validity of the current AASHTO specifications.  In  addition, an analytical model of the instrumented wall will  be developed.    This project will provide the investigator with the  opportunity to expand her expertise into new areas.  The  previous and current work of the investigator has been  primarily analytical, focusing on the engineering  implications of earthquake ground motions and seismic site  response.  The project will also provide her with the  opportunity to work with new partners at the Washington  State Department of Transportation and at other educational  institutions.  ***",
