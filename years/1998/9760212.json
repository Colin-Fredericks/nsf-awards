 "awd_abstract_narration": "***   9760212  Somes    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate a new robot architecture for high-performance force responsiveness.  Current robot utility is hampered by low ability to control environmental interaction forces.  Operations trivial for humans (turning a crank, snap assembly of components, polishing a surface) are beyond current robot capabilities.  The fault lies not in poor control of mechanisms, but in fundamental performance limitations imposed by the dynamics of mechanisms themselves.  A new cable drive transmission has demonstrated outstanding dynamic properties in a few select positioning applications, but it is unproved in force control tasks.  Its large envelope inhibits integration with many mechanical systems.  Phase I will evaluate the cable drive transmission for its capacity to produce high-performance, guaranteed stable force control.  Novel configurations will be studied employing the drive for their practical implementations in robotic manipulators.  The expected performance of the conceptual manipulators will be calculated and compared with existing robots.  Success in this research will apply towards single axis, torque-control mechanisms, with implications for multiple degree-of-freedom robots approaching human-level force control capability.    Commercial applications are expected in:  superior tensioning mechanisms in web processing applications;  automated finishing of fabricated parts, including grinding, deburring, polishing, and blending;  and automated assembly of closely fitting components.  Benefits are also expected in robots that can work in close proximity and provide assistance to human laborers, including the physically impaired.",
