 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725708  Alley    This award is for a coordinated program of data analysis,  forward and inverse modeling in support of the West  Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Program.  Central to many  discussions of West Antarctic stability is the behavior of  ice stream C, the lower part of which slowed greatly about a  century ago.  This has variously been interpreted as  evidence of stabilizing feedbacks, or of accidental response  to ongoing ice sheet drawdown possibly leading to collapse.  Microearthquake observations on ice stream C provide an  especially sensitive probe for ice stream motion and  behavior, allowing detection of basal motion,  and  characterization of basal lubrication, flow resistance  (sticky spots), flow properties, and response to changing  stresses caused by tidal processes or nearby  microearthquakes.  Using an existing data set, the size,  spacing and strength of resistive sticky spots, the rheology  of the lubricating material between sticky spots, and the  spatial variability of these across seven monitoring  stations along still-active and nearly-stopped regions of  the ice stream will be determined.  Assimilation of these  data will require modeling of the ice stream, its basal  system and its coupling to the floating ice shelf down  glacier.  Both forward and inverse modeling will be used to  learn more about the ice streams and the parameters that  control their behavior.  This work should improve our  knowledge of the physics of ice stream basal lubrication and  ice shelf/ice stream coupling.",
