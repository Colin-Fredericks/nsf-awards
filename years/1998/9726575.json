 "awd_abstract_narration": "CMS 9726575  Duval    Previous research suggests that exposure to a fear-arousing  or negative threat appeal type of persuasive communication  can increase level of earthquake preparedness.  In this  study a theory of coping with threatening events referred to  as the person-relative-to-event (PrE) approach is used to  generate predictions concerning the impact of this type of  communication on earthquake preparedness.  In particular,  using PrE theory as a theoretical framework, the proposed  research extends prior findings by determining which levels  and combination of various levels of the variables included  in the content of negative threat appeals are most effective  in increasing earthquake preparedness.  The research will be  conducted in laboratory and field settings and will seek to  (1) advance the technological base on earthquake  preparedness by determining the conditions that increase  individual and household preparedness and mitigation, and  (2) expand the existing data base on earthquake preparedness  by obtaining data on current levels of household  preparedness among two different populations.  The outcomes  from the research can be incorporated into existing  earthquake preparedness programs and can also be applied to  hazards other than earthquakes, e.g., floods, hurricanes,  and tornadoes.",
