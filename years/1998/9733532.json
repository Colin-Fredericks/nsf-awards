 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733532  Gonzalez              Bacterial exopolysaccharide is required for establishment of the nitrogen fixing symbiosis between Rhizobium meliloti and its host plant Medicago sativa (alfalfa), but the precise role of exopolysaccharides in this interaction is not well defined. Succinoglycan, the acidic Calcofluor-binding exopolysaccharide of Rhizobium meliloti strain 1021 is required for effective nodulation. R. meliloti mutants that fail to synthesize succinoglycan form empty nodules that are devoid of bacteria and bacteroids and unable to fix nitrogen. Rm l021 has also the cryptic ability to produce a second exopolysaccharide (EPS II) that suppresses the symbiotic defects succinoglycan-deficient strains on alfalfa nodule invasion. A common theme emerging from these studies is that small quantities of low molecular weight exopolysaccharides are sufficient to mediate successful invasion by R. meliloti mutants which fail to produce exopolysaccharides, implying that low molecular weight exopolysaccharide may act as a signaling molecule during this process. A low molecular weight EPS II fraction consisting of 15-18 EPS II disaccharide subunits efficiently allowed nodule invasion by non-infective strains when present in amounts as low as 7 picomoles per plant, suggesting that low molecular weight EPS II may act as a symbiotic signal during infection.  This  project will perform genetic and biochemical analyses of exopolysaccharide production by R. meliloti and identify the genes involved in the production of the biologically-active low molecular weight form of EPS II. This project will also investigate the roles of succinoglycan and EPS II in symbiosis.  The results will set the stage for the identification of the putative plant receptors for the biologically-active Rhizobium exopolysaccharides and their role in symbiosis.  Polysaccharides are increasingly being recognized as important determinants of virulence in both plant and mammalian pathogens.  Succingoglycan is one of the best-characterized  bacterial polysaccharides and has already advanced understanding of the synthesis and biological roles of polysaccharides in other bacteria, including human pathogens.  Basic studies of polysaccharide biosynthesis might eventually contribute to the design of enzymatic steps in the synthesis of complex carbohydrates to control linkage specificity and stereochemistry.  These studies may lead to insights into the possible broader use of oligosaccharides as signals in biological systems than has generally been recognized.  These studies promise to lead to a better understanding of plant-bacterial symbiosis which is necessary for biological nitrogen fixation.",
