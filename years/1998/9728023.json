Regulation of Reproductive and Stress Axes by the Metabolic  Signal, Leptin    Food availability affects reproductive function.  Key to  understanding as well as many other bodily functions, lies  in our ability to understand how the brain gathers  information on the availability of food. A major gap in our  understanding of how food availability controls reproduction  was filled recently with the discovery of a hormone called  leptin.  Blood leptin concentrations increase after meals in  most animals reporting to the brain a satiety signal.  Exactly how the brain senses these satiety signals like  leptin is only beginning to be understood.  Dr. Thompson  will determine how the brain senses leptin and more  specifically, communicates this leptin information to brain  centers that control reproductive function.  One hypothesis  tested in this research plan is that information about  altered food availability is relayed to the reproductive  brain centers via brain centers that are involved in sensing  \"stress\".  This idea arose when researches from different  backgrounds demonstrated two points.  First, stress or  stressful experiences have negative effects upon  reproductive systems.  Second, during conditions where food  availability is very low, brain systems known to control  stress are activated.  Thus, conditions where food is in  very short supply are stressful.  However, little is known  if the activation of these stress systems is the path by  which information concerning severely reduced food  availability is communicated to reproductive systems.  This  will be examined in this project.  Additionally, many  molecules in addition to leptin serve as \"food signals\". One  other signal is glucose.  Do different food signals  communicate to the reproductive system using the same  pathways or are there unique pathways for each food signal?  Using similar logic, are all stressful situations or  conditions influence d by food signals?  Dr. Thompson will  explore these questions and information developed in this  work will be used to further understand how the brain uses  food information to control reproductive function.",
