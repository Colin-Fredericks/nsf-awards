 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kolter  9728936  When nutrients are plentiful and conditions are propitious for growth most bacteria grow exponentially. However, due to the usual limited availability of nutrients, exponential growth periods tend be short-lived and bacteria must cope with prolonged periods of starvation. Many gram-negative bacteria, among them Escherichia coli, respond to starvation by developing increased resistance to environmental stresses. For E. coli, this starvation response is controlled in great part by a starvation-inducible sigma factor sigma-s, the product of the rpoS gene. Soon after the entry into the stationary phase of growth induction of the sigma-s regulon results in a homogeneous population of highly resistant cells.  However, if starvation continues for very long what ensues is anything but stationary.  Despite the induction of the rpoS regulon, prolonged starvation inevitably leads to a heterogeneous population with some cells dying while others survive. Most importantly, the survivors in starving populations are not just cells identical to the initial strain but rather the progeny of mutant subpopulations that have a Growth Advantage in Stationary Phase (referred to as mutants that can express a  GASP phenotype).                                                    From these observations emerges the hypothesis that underlies this research:  In some instances starving bacterial populations can both survive and evolve by repeated takeovers of GASP mutants under conditions when essential nutrients are provided predominantly by the dead cells.  This hypothesis makes many predictions and raises many questions.  The fact that mutant alleles of rpoS which result in reduced expression of the sigma-s regulon can confer the GASP phenotype indicates that under some starvation conditions maximal expression of the regulon is not advantageous. Two questions arise. First, what is the range of mutant alleles obtainable and how is the sigma-s product affected?  Second, if there are conditions where less  sigma-s is better, is there allelic variation in rpoS among wild-type isolates of E. coli?  Additionally, populations that are taken over by GASP mutants can themselves be taken over by subsequent second and even third generation GASP mutants. Here again several questions arise.  How many cycles of GASPing can occur before a strain will no longer evolve under a particular selective condition?  Where do additional GASP-conferring mutations lie?  Finally, the physiology of the GASP phenomenon needs to be addressed in much more detail.  What are the GASP mutants utilizing as nutrients and where are these nutrients coming from?  To address these questions the following experiments are being conducted:  1) Isolate a collection of GASP-conferring rpoS alleles and determine the changes in the gene and analyze changes in the expression of sigma-s activity.  2) Obtain fresh wild-type isolates of E. coli from diverse environments and sequence their rpoS genes and characterize their sigma-s proteins.  3)  Determine how many rounds of GASP can occur under one set of defined starvation conditions and identify genetic loci able to confer subsequent rounds of GASP.  4) Identify nutrients that GASP mutants can obtain from the dead cells in the population.  5) Identify genes that are required for the expression of GASP when a cell harbors a GASP-conferring allele or alleles.",
