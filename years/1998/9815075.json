The research is complementary to the activities of the Engineering Research Center (ERC) at the University of Arizona, with core partners at Stanford University, MIT, and the University of California at Berkeley, on Environmentally Benign Manufacturing of Semiconductors.  The scope of the research funded under this award includes dry resist deposition (MIT), supercritical fluid resist development (Cornell), and process integration (ASU).  The major emphasis of the research is to find alternate materials and processes that avoid or greatly reduce the use of potentially hazardous or environmentally detrimental chemicals.  The research is coordinated with the Engineering Research Center and reviewed annually at the annual site visit review of the ERC to assure the maximum leverage and relevance to the overall activities of the ERC.  Students are being educated in the important field of semiconductor manufacturing with strong emphasis on enviromental implications.",
