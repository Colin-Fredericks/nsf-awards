 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT           The Santa Cruz Island Reserve (SCIR) on one of California's  Channel Islands, is operated by the University of California,  Santa Barbara (UCSB). The reserve is one of the most used sites  in the University of California's Natural Reserve System (NRS).  SCIR supports a wide variety of year-round field research  projects in habitats as diverse as marine subtidal and intertidal  environments, fresh-water streams, coastal grasslands, sage  scrub, chaparral,  and oak and coniferous woodlands.  This  project will provide for efficient and effective communications  connections for the new database center at SCIR.  The center is  housed in a donated building that was recently moved to the site,  renovated, and equipped.      The project will provide new opportunities for field scientists  to enter, process, and analyze data while in the field, thereby  guiding research efforts. The proposed telecommunications link  will allow visiting scientists to communicate with staff and  colleagues and to transmit data from the field station to their  home institutions. The proposed project will provide the  capability to store and move large data files, such as remote  sensing images, between mainland and  island sites. There is substantial demand for this database  development, management, and availability, which will support  research and teaching projects, and increase research  productivity, at the field station. These data sets will be  available to users throughout the world via the Internet. UC has  already demonstrated substantial commitment to this project by  acquiring and renovating a building at SCIR, by equipping it with  GIS hardware and software,  and by supporting database development.",
