Our ability to describe and predict turbulent phenomena strongly    impacts such diverse fields as environmental pollution, weather    prediction, commercial chemical processes, aircraft and ship design,    ocean dynamics, and astrophysics. Turbulence is thus a subject of    great importance and demands serious attention. Yet, it is one of the    poorly understood subjects, despite about hundred years of serious    research.    Why is this so? It is trite but true to say that it is a very    difficult subject. The difficulties stem from the fundamentally    complex dynamical characteristics of turbulence including, for    example, strong nonlinearity, the simultaneous presence of a large    number of interacting degrees of freedom across a wide range of    spatial scales, marked departure from statistical equilibrium, and so    forth. More than $10^{18}$ degrees of freedom can be excited in    turbulent flows typical of atmospheric phenomena. This makes full    computer simulation of such flows impractical. Experimental studies    have also suffered because of approximations such as Taylor's    hypothesis and the use of one-dimensional surrogates for    three-dimensional quantities.    A confluence of important advances has occurred in the last decade:    new experimental tools have emerged, and enabled direct measurement    of spatio-temporal fields of turbulence, and new parameter ranges are    being explored in experiments by harnessing air at high pressures or    unconventional fluids such as helium. Direct numerical simulation has    become a powerful tool for the study of turbulence. Recent    improvements in computer memory and speed, especially the    availability of we ll-integrated massively parallel machines, have    made computer simulation a useful complement to laboratory    experiments. In addition, greater insights into the behavior of    nonlinear partial differential equations are being acquired rapidly.    Together, these advances have had a qualitative impact on the    understanding of turbulence dynamics, and on the development of    working models in engineering practice. Particular progress has been    achieved in the case of passive admixtures (such as dye, water vapor,    pollutants which are mixed by turbulence, but do not feed back to the    turbulent motion itself). For example, theoretical predictions have    been made for anomalous scaling in a class of passive admixtures.    These predictions are in turn supported by direct numerical    simulation.    To assess these recent advances and define, where possible, new    directions for the field, a conference is being organized at Los    Alamos between the 25th and 28th of May 1998. The conference is being    supported by the National Science Foundation and the Los Alamos    National Laboratory. The specific goal of the conference is to    provide an opportunity for scientists world-wide to communicate    recent critical advances in fundamental studies and engineering    applications of fluid turbulence, and to foster further development    of this broad field of nonlinear science.",
