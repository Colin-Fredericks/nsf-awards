This conference is organized every other year by different institutions. It is not affiliated with any professional organization and is held in a style similar to Gordon Conferences. The community typically attending these meetings consists of both atmospheric scientists, in particular laboratory researchers, and investigators involved with physical chemistry. The interactions between these different groups is one of the strengths of these meetings, where both basic and applied work is discussed. NSF support will help graduate students and post-docs are to attend this meeting.",
