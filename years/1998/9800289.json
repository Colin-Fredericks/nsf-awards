 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. James Richardson, Mr. John Crock will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will conduct archaeological research on Anguilla, a small relatively flat limestone island with an area of 55 square km and a maximum elevation of 65 m. It is the northernmost island in the Lesser Antillean chain and has been the subject of intensive archaeological survey. Because deposition rate is low and arable land extensively plowed it is likely that all archaeological sites are known. Most Caribbean islands were occupied as early as the first millennium BC and underwent significant change at roughly the end of first millennium AD. The post Saladoid cultures are characterized by larger populations who inhabited both more and larger sites in comparison to their earlier counterparts. The appearance of large numbers of exotic and rare items such as ground stone axes and copper ornaments and their unequal distribution over space suggests the emergence of a hierarchical chiefly society. On Anguilla Mr. Crock has located several sites which span the pre and post Saladoid period as well as many others which follow the transition. The goal of his research is to search for the mechanisms which underlay the change and which allowed power to become concentrated in chiefly hands.  Because the island is both small and poor in natural resources it is relatively easy to determine what was imported and thus constitutes a high status good. This gives Mr. Crock the ability to characterize with relative ease the status differences both between sites and between different habitation areas within a single site.   Because islands have clearly demarcated boundaries they have formed the basis for many comparative studies in both anthropology and may subfields of biology. The Caribbean provides an almost laboratory setting since many islands were inhabited at roughly the same time by relatively few linguistic groups and thus started their prehistories with a relatively homogeneous population. Across the region islands vary greatly in terms of size, geology, arable land and other natural resources. It is therefore possible to compare differences in cultural sequences between islands and then attempt to relate these to environmental variables. Archaeological research is considerably more advanced in Puerto Rico and windward islands compared to Anguilla and other leeward island counterparts. This research should help to provide the necessary counterbalance. It is important because it will provide insight into the emergence of hierarchical societies and it will also contribute to training a promising young scientist.",
