 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jiali Gao is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and Computational   Chemistry Program to continue his development of a hybrid quantum   mechanical and statistical mechanical technique to simulate chemical   processes in solution and in heterogeneous catalysis.  The objective of   the research is to obtain reasonably quantitative agreement with   experimental solvation energies.  The approach provides new insights on   the nature of intermolecular interactions, in particular, specific   contributions from the polarization effects for processes of biochemical   and materials interest in condensed phases.  Applications involve the   thermolysis of alpha-chloroethers and hydrolysis of model compounds for   glycosyl derivatives in organic and aqueous solutions.  Another major   thrust of the research is the study of adsorption, binding, and chemical   reactions associated with methanol-to-gasoline conversion using zeolite   catalysis.  Most chemical processes of commercial importance take place in solution.    Computer simulations of chemical reactions in solution provide important   molecular level insights into the factors that influence reaction rates.    Many of the more interesting bond breaking reactions, however, exhibit   quantum effects that cannot be modeled effectively using empirical   potentials. Gao's approach involves the use of a combined simulation   approach which uses Monte Carlo and molecular orbital theory to treat the   quantum degrees of freedom undergoing change during the chemical   reaction.",
