Applications include searching for (lost)  objects, localization of nearby obstacles, mapping, docking  with structures or moving objects surveillance, and  surveying.  Despite progress on the development of vision-  based terrestrial and airborne ATR systems, realization of  similar capabilities for submersible systems is a  challenging problem due to the unique conditions of the  undersea environment.    This research effort involves a study of the vision-based  ATR problem using a theory-based scientific approach,  resting on physics-based modeling and active sensing  paradigms.  The goal is to provide an underwater vehicle  system with the intelligence to perform the following  functions autonomously:           Explore immediate surroundings without collision with       nearby obstacles.           Locate objects of interest and fixate on them.           Make intelligent moves and execute appropriate actions       to efficiently examine the target and obtain useful       information for recognition.           Construct a knowledge base about the scene by       integration of information from multiple views and different       imaging conditions.    Specifically, the researchers seek to develop techniques for  obtaining information (e.g., three-dimensional shape, range,  motion, reflectance properties) about objects in the scene  from video data, according to:           Physics-based models of underwater image formation,       taking into account scene geometry and reflectance       characteristics, illumination and viewing geometry, and       ocean optical properties.           Novel theories for adaptive online adjustment of sensor       parameters (e.g., field of view, focus of attention), and       positions and directions of viewing and scene illumination,       to optimize data quality and information content.           Mathema tical approach to registration and merging of       visual information, obtained from various views and under       different imaging conditions.  ***",
