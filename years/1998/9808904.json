 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rumpho  9808904    Photosynthesis is the only biological phenomenon that transfers light energy from the sun into molecules that  provide an energy sources for developing and mature plant  life forms and, in the process, produces oxygen.  This process is typically limited to the plant kingdom, some bacteria, and the algae.  However, a photosynthetic marine slug, Elysia chlorotica, has evolved as a result of forming  an intracellular symbiosis with chloroplasts from the  chromophytic marine alga, Vaucheria litorea.  Once the  symbiosis is established, Elysia can subsist in culture for  at least nine months exclusively by carrying out  photoautotrophic CO2 fixation as long as a source of light  and CO2 is provided.  This unusual, naturally occurring photosynthetic animal will be exploited for long-term  studies of the mechanisms regulating the symbiotic association and the continued functioning of the  chloroplasts in the absence of the usual sorts of regulation by the plant nucleo-cytoplasm.  Several interrelated lines  of investigation are proposed to address the question of the  genetic and biochemical autonomy of the plastids as well as  the potential for regulatory communication between the  animal nucleo-cytosol and the algal chloroplast  genome  contributing to the success of the symbiotic association.  The specific objectives include: identifying the carbon  product exported from the symbiotic plastids to the seaslug, characterizing the ability of the seaslug and chloroplasts  to maintain the composition and activity of the photosynthetic electron transport machinery over the life-time of the association; determining if the slug nuclear genome codes for and targets any proteins to the symbiotic  chloroplasts; and elucidating the genetic autonomy of the symbiotic chloroplasts by mapping and partially sequencing  the chloroplast genome of V. litorea.  Findings from these studies will increase the general understanding of the intracellular regulation between chloroplasts and the nucleo cytosol in a natural and foreign environment, the autonomy of  chloroplasts, and the evolution of organellar symbiotic associations.",
