On overlapping patches of M, the coordinates  are related by transformations in the Lie group G.  Following Cartan  and Ehresmann, the coordinate charts globalize to a \"development\" of  the universal covering space U of M into G/H, defining a homomorphism  of the fundamental group F of M (realized as the group of deck  transformations of U).  One forms a moduli space Def(M,G/H) of  geometric structures on M modelled on G/H which classifies structures  up to equivalence.  Def(M,G/H) is itself locally homeomorphic to a  moduli space of equivalence classes of homomorphisms Hom(F,G)/G.  The  prototype of these moduli spaces is the Teichmuller space, classifying  hyperbolic structures (here G/H is the real hyperbolic plane and G =  PSL(2,R)).  Moreover the mapping class group of M acts on both  Def(M,G/H) and Hom(F,G)/G, and the holonomy map from Def(M,G/H) ->  Hom(F,G)/G is equivariant with respect to these actions.  This  investigation mainly concentrates on the case when F is the fundamental  group of a compact surface.  When M is a closed surface, these moduli  spaces carry invariant symplectic structures, and when G is compact the  investigator conjectures that the symplectic measure is ergodic under  the action of the mapping class group.  When G is SL(2,R), this moduli  space is related to Teichmuller space of (possibly singular) hyperbolic  structures, and the investigator has used geometric structures to study  the dynamics on the moduli space.  This dynamical study relates the  action of the discrete mapping class group to certain Hamiltonian flows  on the moduli space.  When G/H is Minkowski 2+1-space, the investigator  (in collaboration with Drumm) is studying the deformation spaces of  complete flat manifolds, using \"crooked planes\" developed in Drumm's  thesis and ideas of Margulis.  When G/H is complex hyperbo lic 2-space,  Xia has classified the connected components of Hom(F,G)/G and the  investigator (in collaboration with Leeb and Kapovich) has found discrete  embeddings in each component.  When G/H is the real projective plane,  the work of the investigator combined with that of Choi gives a complete  description of the deformation space Def(M,G/H).       Such geometric structures represent a way of relating topology and  geometry.  According to Felix Klein's Erlangen program, geometry is  the study of relations between objects in a homogeneous space G/H of a  Lie group G that are invariant under the transformations in G.  They  include \"rigid\" geometric properties such as distance, angle,  parallelism and collinearity.  On the other hand, topology studies the  loose organization of points on a manifold M, where the only relations  derive from continuous mapping.  A geometric structure on M more  rigidly organizes its points through local coordinate charts from open  sets in M to G/H.  Moduli spaces parametrize equivalence classes of  these structures and closely relate to spaces of homomorphisms of the  fundamental group of M into G.  These moduli spaces themselves enjoy  rich geometric structures of their own, and display unusual symmetries  arising from their origin as natural geometric objects.  A better  understanding of such basic objects has time and again repaid the  effort through insights in related fields, typically in theoretical  physics.  ***",
