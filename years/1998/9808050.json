Little work has been done on homicide and other violent crimes where rates are low.  Northern New England, where violent crime rates are among the lowest in the nation, has been largely neglected.  Studies of Southern, immigrant, minority, urban violence rest on assumptions, usually implicit, about why homicide rates are low among Northern, settled, native, rural, white people. The purpose of this  project, therefore, is to create a long-term, disaggregated time series of violent crimes and violent deaths in New Hampshire and Vermont.  The study includes suicides, accidental deaths, and casualties of war, because the history of homicide is intricately intertwined with the history of reckless behavior , although the focus is homicide.  Data will be compared to those from selected counties in Ohio, Georgia, and Virginia so hypotheses concerning northern New England can be tested.  Data analysis methods include exploratory data analysis, log-linear analysis, and other appropriate techniques.   Results of this work are expected to  have a major impact on sociolegal theorizing about the factors that contribute to violence and will provide an historical contrast for policy makers who hope to intervene to reduce current levels of violence.\r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nSince the nineteenth century, scholars have written voluminously  on homicide the U.S. to try to explain why this country has the highest rates of violence among industrialized nations.
