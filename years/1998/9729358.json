 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to purchase a scanning laser confocal microscope with  two-photon capabilities to measure the 3D conformation of living  cells, tissues, macromolecular assemblies, and novel materials. With  this new microscope, one can (i) slice clean, thin optical sections  out of thick fluorescent specimens and light scattering materials,  (ii) view specimen planes parallel to the line of sight, (iii)  penetrate deep into light-scattering tissues, living cells, complex  fluids, and complex materials, and (iv) gain 3-D views at very high  resolution. This new microscope will compliment the experimental  techniques currently used by Hopkins faculty, active in research  projects in biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, materials  science and biology. This proposal details four projects where the  new SLCM will have a dramatic impact. These projects include: (1)  the development of a high resolution particle-tracking instrument  coupled to the new confocal microscope to probe the in vitro and in  vivo mechanical properties of biopolymers; (2) studying the lateral  organization of membrane proteins in epithelial cells emphasizing  the packaging of glycosylphos-phatidylinositol-anchored proteins,  GPI-proteins, for targeted delivery to the apical surface of  morphologically polarized cells; (3) studying the molecular  mechanisms by which chromatin insulators affect enhancer-promoter  interactions; in particular, studying the gypsy insulator, a  sequence located in the 5' transcribed untranslated region of the  gypsy retrotransposon of Drosophila; (4) monitoring the process of  transfecting cells and micro-organelles translocations with high  spatial and time resolution. One of the primary educational  objectives for acquiring a confocal microscope is to train Hopkins  scientists and engineers to use one of the most versatile and  promising tools of investigation in the life and materials sciences.  Of course, such a powerful instrument cannot be used properly and to  its full potential with out proper training. Therefore, two of the Co-  PIS will be teaching a new course entitled \"Practical Confocal  Microscopy\" to be offered during the January intersession to  advanced graduate students in science and engineering who are  interested in learning how to use the confocal microscope in their  graduate research.",
