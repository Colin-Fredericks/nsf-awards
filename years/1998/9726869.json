 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT      This project will test the global hypothesis that earthworm invasion of north temperate forests will have large consequences for nutrient retention and uptake in these ecosystems. Furthermore, it is suggested that invasion of new forest habitats by non-native earthworms will be an important component of change in ecosystem processes in many northeastern forests in the coming decades.  Previous research has shown that invasion of forests by exotic earthworms dramatically alters forest floor structure and potentially affects key nutrient cycling processes, such as nitrification. However, it is not clear how the dramatic physical changes in forest soil caused by earthworm invasion relate to overall system-level nutrient uptake, fine-root production or foliar chemistry.  Four main hypotheses will increase understanding of this potentially important process in forest ecosystems.  Our predictions are that earthworm invasion will:    1. Increase hydrologic and gaseous losses of N and decrease retention of exogenous N.  2. Alter soil nutrient-supplying (N and P) capacity with consequences for plant nutrient demand and foliar nutrient contents and ratios.  3. Change the vertical distribution, production and functioning of fine roots.  4. Produce different responses depending on the species of earthworm invading.    These hypotheses will be addressed with a two-pronged approach.  The first approach will involve controlled introductions of earthworms into experimental forest plots.  These plots will provide insight into the transition that occurs immediately following earthworm invasion.  The second approach will involve comparing forest stands already invaded by earthworms with adjacent stands lacking earthworms, viewing these stands as endpoints along a gradient of earthworm invasion.  To expand the generality of  findings, experiments will be conducted in forest at two different geographic locations, one in eastern and the other in central New York.  This work will document the obvious a nd expected decline in forest floor depth and redistribution of surface organic matter in the soil profile following earthworm invasion, will then determine how these changes affect the ability of these forests to retain exogenous N and provide nutrients to support plant growth.  Retention of atmospheric N will be assessed by tracing the movement of small additions of 15 N and Br' through the top 30 cm of the soil profile.  Hydrologic nutrient losses will be measured using zero-tension lysimeters and gaseous N losses using field chambers and soil cores.    This research will provide new information on a critical but overlooked factor in the study and management of north temperate forests.  The influence of earthworms on biogeochemistry in natural ecosystems, especially forests, has received little attention in North America.  Results will allow the determination of  whether earthworm invasion will be a factor influencing the long-term productivity of these forests and whether earthworms will influence the response of these forests to other factors, such as nitrogen deposition, climate change and exotic plant invasions.",
