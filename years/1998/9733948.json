The  research has three main directions:    1) developing and analyzing mathematical formulations,  efficient algorithms and computer implementations for  problems arising with ITS equipped with on-line information  and control technologies.  Problems include:  dynamic  modeling of the interactions between demand and supply  components; generation of consistent and anticipatory route  guidance; dynamic signal control and ramp metering and their  integration with dynamic traffic assignment; and development  of efficient algorithms for the computation of time-  dependent shortest paths.    2) expanding network optimization methods and the knowledge  base in the field of design and development of new  algorithms and their computer implementation and testing to  solve very large scale real-life applications.  The emphasis  is on the development of new methods that are amenable to  efficient coarse grain parallel implementations.    3) developing high performance computing systems for  parallel implementations of dynamic transportation network  models and algorithms in order to meet the real-time  requirement of ITS; developing parallel optimization methods  to generate solutions to very large scale off-line real-life  applications; and developing mathematical measures to  analyze, assess and predict the performance of parallel  computing systems.    Education activities include:  contribution to the  development of a new curriculum and paradigm for the  education of future transportation professionals; innovation  in improving the learning and teaching experience b y  participating in the implementation of the concept of MIT  learning networks; contribution to a departmental initiative  that aims to develop a new curriculum for undergraduate  education; development of a textbook; outreach activities;  and transfer of research into practice.",
