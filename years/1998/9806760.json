 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Northwest Greenland Photograph Identification Project    This project will collect information about individuals in photographs taken between 1908 and 1954 by Donald B. MacMillan in the Thule district of Northwest Greenland, now in the collections of the Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum.  The project will focus on identifying individuals and establishing ties to their descendants.  Information about the location of individuals at important points of their lives (birth, marriage, childbirth, death) will be collected.  The project will also increase local access to the historic photographs of the community, through museum exhibitions and publications.  To this end, an exhibit of the photographs will be produced in collaboration with the Thule Museum of Qaanaaq.  While this study is focused on answering basic questions about people in the photographs, one ultimate goal of the project is to begin to make use of the collection and information for further anthropological and ethnohistoric work.",
