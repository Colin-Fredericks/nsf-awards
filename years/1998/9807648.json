 "awd_abstract_narration": "9807648  Pollock    Carbon additions have a beneficial effect on reducing the  incidence of grain defects that develop during  solidification of superalloy single crystals.  This research  examines the fundamental basis for this effect.  The program  is a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University and  General Electric Corporate Research and Development and  General Electric Power Systems, and falls under the GOALI  program funded by the DMR Metals Research Program and the  MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  The specific  goals of this research on superalloys are twofold: (1) to  determine the mechanisms by which carbon additions influence  grain defect formation during directional solidification,  and (2) to obtain an improved understanding of the range of  alloy composition over which carbon serves as a beneficial  addition.  This research aims to develop a better overall  understanding of the processes which result in the breakdown  of single crystal solidification in nickel-base alloys.  This is accomplished with an experimental program that  examines a number of different aspects of alloy structure  and chemistry that influence the solidification process.  First since refractory-rich carbides precipitate in the  vicinity of the liquidus temperature, carbide structure and  compositions are examined as a function of alloy chemistry.  Differential thermal analysis is employed to measure  solidus, liquidus, and carbide solution temperatures.  To  examine the distribution of alloying elements in the mushy  zone and to obtain measurements of fraction solid as a  function of temperature, directional solidification  experiments interrupted by quenching are conducted.  Electron microprobe analyses are used to characterize  segregation in these samples.  To examine the influence of  alloy chemistry on grain defect formation, single crystal  directional solidification experiments are conducted with a  number of compositions that have distinctly different  characteristics in terms of se gregation, carbide density,  and carbide precipitation temperatures.  %%%  This research examines defect formation in high temperature  superalloy castings and relates to applications in turbine  engines.  Educational benefits include student interaction  with General Electric Corporation laboratories.  ***",
