 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smith  9726425    Tropical rainforests are renowned for their extraordinary diversity of  species. Birds are prominent in this regard, as tropical rainforests  contain a spectacular array of unique species having no parallel elsewhere.  However, the specific evolutionary mechanisms that generate biodiversity  are poorly understood. In this proposal, morphologic and genetic data will  be gathered to test a new hypothesis for rainforest speciation. This  hypothesis postulates that ecotones, small rainforest fragments that exist  in the grasslands outside the central rainforest, are habitats in which new  adaptations and new species appear that can enrich the biodiversity of  central rainforests. Natural selection in ecotone populations of three  rainforest bird species will be quantified and the morphologic divergence  between them and central rainforest populations will be estimated.    Although this study addresses fundamental evolutionary questions, it also  has important conservation implications for sub-Saharan Africa. Centrally  located rainforest areas are presently the main focus of conservation  efforts, whereas ecotone regions are rapidly being lost due to overgrazing,  burning and wood harvesting with little or no effort toward their  conservation. Such ecotone regions are assumed to be less important because  they are mosaics of pure habitat types that may contain fewer species and  smaller, more unstable populations.  However, it is possible that these  transition areas between forest and savanna are important sources of  evolutionary novelty that contribute to rainforest biodiversity.            \\\\Clm-06\\debpop\\POPBIO\\ABSTRACT\\SMITH425.ABS",
