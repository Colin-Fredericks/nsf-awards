Hydrogen  is often  used  for  passivation,  for  example  to  fill  dangling  bond states  in  amorphous  silicon,  reducing the density of states in the energy gap. In other cases,  under  study  here, hydrogen may attach to a deep level  impurity  resulting in a new complex which is electrically active. Examples  of  such  deep level states in n-type silicon are AuH,  AuH2  and  FeAuH centers, whose identities and structures may be established  by  IR  absorption and Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy  (DLTS).  The  work carried out under this grant uses the methods cited and  also  ESR,  on impurity doped semiconductor specimens  which  are  typically hydrogen annealed and electron irradiated using  a  Van  de  Graaff accelerator. Of interest are the electrical properties  and  the structural properties of such defects. The work is  also  concerned  with  theoretical modeling of the  defects  and  their  properties. This research program is interdisciplinary in  nature  and  typically  involves one or more undergraduate  and  graduate  students,  who  receive  excellent training  in  preparation  for  careers in industry, government laboratories or academia.  %%%  This   experimental  research  is  focused  on  the  nature   and  electrical   properties  of  a  specific  type  of  impurity   in  semiconductors  such as silicon. Silicon is a basic  material  in  producing  microelectronic devices for computers and  many  other  applications. Silicon must be highly purified for successful  use  in producing transistors and other microelectronic devices.  Even  extremelly  small concentrations of impurities, such as  gold  or  iron,  or  of defects such as vacant lattice sites, can  be  very  important.  It is useful to know the details of the defects  that  can   occur, and to learn of the possible electrical actions  that  can  result.  This project is devoted to learning the  electrical  and  structural  properties of a class  of  impurity  defects  in  silicon and related semiconductors. These defects are produced by  a  combination of a \"deep level\" impurity such as gold  or  iron,  with  hydrogen. Hydrogen is sometimes introduced in semiconductor  processing because in many cases it \"passivates\", or reduces  the  electrical effects, of certain impurities or defects. However, in  the cases under study in this work, the hydrogen has the opposite  effect,   of   making  the  normally  passive   \"deep   impurity\"  electrically  active.  The  methods  involved  in  this  research  involve  semiconductor  specimens which are  intentionally  doped  with, eg, iron or gold, and subsequently annealed in hydrogen and  bombarded  with  high  energy electrons  from  a  Van  de  Graaff  accelerator.  These steps make the defects; study is  done  by  a  combination of optical absorption in the infrared range, electron  spin resonance, and a technique for measuring electrically active  defect  properties known as \"Deep Level Transient  Spectroscopy\".  This  basic research adds to scientific understanding of  silicon  and   other  semiconductors,  which  are  at  the  heart  of  the  microelectronics and computer technologies. The  information  may  be useful in the design and successful operation of manufacturing  processes   for  microelectronics.  This  research   program   is  interdisciplinary in nature and typically involves  one  or  more  undergraduate  and  graduate  students,  who  receive   excellent  training  in  preparation  for careers  in  industry,  government  laboratories or academia.  ***",
