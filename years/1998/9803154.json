 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project  is devoted to innovative applications of the geometry of\r\nmoving frames  and the mathematical theory of differential invariants to\r\nproblems arising in computer vision, with emphasis on medical imaging. \r\nSince symmetry forms a basic component of the human visual system, it should be\r\nnaturally incorporated into mathematical methods for image processing and object\r\nrecognition. The image processing applications to be considered will include\r\ndenoising and smoothing, segmentation and edge detection, as well as object\r\nrecognition, including symmetry detection and partial occlusions. Practical\r\nimplementations will be based on the signature curve paradigm, that is based on the construction of suitable differential invariants for the symmetry group under consideration.  Metrics that distinguish signature curves of different objects will be compared, with the goal being to recognize and extract objects from both two and three-dimensional images.  Practical implementations of the image processing systems will rely on a new method of constructing symmetry-preserving numerical approximations to differential invariants that is to be developed as a part of this project.  The applications will be based on a new, practical theory of moving frames, that can be applied  to general group actions, both finite and infinite-dimensional.  Part of the project will be devoted to the further development of this general theory. Various additional applications, to problems arising in physics, geometry, invariant theory, and the calculus of variations, will also be investigated.\r\n\r\n",
