 "awd_abstract_narration": "The general objective of this project is the development of techniques in the \r\ncalculus of variations and in the regularity theory for systems of partial \r\ndifferential equations.  The applications that guide this work come mainly from\r\nthe areas of continuum mechanics of liquids and solids.  Tools from geometric \r\nmeasure theory, a theory for the study of generalizations of surfaces, will play an\r\nimportant role.  The analysis will be undertaken for time-dependent problems, \r\nincluding in some cases certain idealizations where inertial effects are neglected.\r\nThe main focus will be on the search for the effective description of  \r\nmaterials with complicated composition, on the study of regularity properties \r\nof solutions in the bulk and at interfaces, and on the prediction of their \r\noscillatory or hysteretic behavior as time evolves. \r\n\r\nThe research will be on the mathematical description and prediction of a range of\r\nphenomena that occur in material science. This includes phase transformations \r\n(between liquid and solid phases), the structure, nucleation and growth of such \r\nphases, and fracture and defects in solids.  An important part of this work will\r\nbe the study of mathematical models for novel man-made materials such as \r\nshape memory alloys, ferroelectric, magnetic and magnetostrictive materials,  \r\ncomposites, liquid crystals, and thin films.  Although unexpected, the mathematical\r\ntheory also provides new methods for image segmentation in computer vision. \r\nThe mathematical challenges lie in the description of the dynamics and evolution of \r\nmicroscopic structures and of phenomena that occur at vastly different temporal or spatial\r\nscales. They require recently developed mathematical tools and the introduction \r\nof new mathematical techniques.\r\n\r\n",
