 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stephenson  9806691              Inbreeding depression is the reduction in fitness of inbred  progeny (progeny resulting from self-pollinations or pollinations   by close relatives) relative to outcrossed progeny. An impressive   body of theory predicts that inbreeding depression is a major   force in the evolution of floral traits (size, shape, color, odor,   etc. of flowers) and mating patterns in plants. Over the past   century many studies have shown that inbreeding reduces relative   survivorship and the relative number and quality of the seeds   produced by plants. However, most studies have ignored the effects   of inbreeding on the male (pollen) function of plants despite the   fact that most plants are hermaphrodites (produce both pollen and   seeds). Moreover, we know little about how the magnitude of   inbreeding depression changes with growing (environmental)   conditions. Finally, there remains much debate concerning the   genetic basis of inbreeding depression. Consequently, we will   perform a series of projects designed 1) to quantify and compare   the magnitude of inbreeding depression on survivorship and   reproduction through both the male and female functions, 2) to   examine the relationship between inbreeding depression and   environmental stress, 3) to determine the relationship between   inbreeding and fitness across four levels of inbreeding, and 4) to   determine the proximate cause of inbreeding depression on the male   function.              The data obtained from the projects in this proposal will  result in the first comprehensive study of the effects of   inbreeding on the male function of plants; they will generate   testable predictions (and the seeds necessary to test these   predictions) concerning the genetic basis of inbreeding   depression; they will allow us to better predict the direction in   which floral traits will evolve under different environmental   conditions; and they will allow us to critically evaluate the   theory surrounding the evolution  of plant mating patterns. From a   practical perspective, our findings will have important   ramifications for agriculture (e.g., the hybrid seed industry uses   inbred lines of plants as the major component in their breeding   programs), conservation biology (e.g., the preservation of   endangered plants that now exist only in small, highly inbred   populations), and forestry (where pollen selection is of utmost   importance because traditional plant breeding techniques fail due   to the long generation time of trees).",
