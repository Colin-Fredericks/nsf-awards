 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nAbstract for DEB-9726592 White\r\n\r\nWetlands are a major global source of two important greenhouse gases: methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2).  In northern peatlands, plant community composition affects the rates at which carbon cycles through the ecosystem and thus the rates at which these gases are produced.  The responses of peatland plant communities to altered temperature and hydrologic regimes are poorly understood.  Consequently, it is difficult to predict how changes in plant community composition will be affected by climate change and will affect carbon cycling and greenhouse gas generation.  This project will focus on changes in plant community composition as well as carbon and nutrient balances in response to soil warming and water level fluctuations.  \r\nThe PIs have transplanted blocks of peat to a University of Minnesota lab facility, making miniature peat ecosystems, or 'mesocosms'.  In several different treatment combinations, the PIs will use infrared lamps to adjust soil warmth and will fix the water level to either 0, 10, or 20 cm below the peat surface.  Subsequent monitoring of methane production, destruction, and emission in the mesocosms will help the researchers determine how peat ecosystem functioning responds to the temperature and water treatments.  The PIs will also measure root productivity and above ground growth to assess how different plant species react to the changes.  Major benefits of this work will include a better understanding of the overall functioning of peat ecosystems, their contributions to global biogeochemical cycles, and their response to changes in climate.\r\n",
