 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this GOALI Faculty in Industry project are  to enhance and share understanding, between academia and  industry, of respective technical goals and constraints  related to vehicle powertrain systems, through collaborative  vehicular powertrain research  and technology transfer. The  technical focus of the project is to develop improved  control and diagnostic aspects of vehicle powertrain  systems, and  maintain system robustness within a highly  cost-sensitive environment. Another important objective of  this project is to gain an intimate knowledge of powertrain  research activities at several major European vehicle  research centers, and to better understand the industry  needs from the European perspective. The bulk of the work  will be carried out by Professor John J. Moskwa at the Ford  Research and Engineering Center in Laindon, Essex, England.  Funds are also provided to meet travel expenses to other  academic and industrial research groups within Europe. There  will also be some research collaboration with the University  of Cambridge.",
