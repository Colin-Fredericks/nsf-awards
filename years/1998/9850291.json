 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to create a practical, hands-on applied learning  experience for students enrolled in courses of aquaculture, environmental science  technology (EST), economics/business and humanities programs of the College. This  experience will involve students, under the direction of participating faculty in: the research  of the culture of aquarium live rock; the environmental monitoring of live rock culture and  harvesting activities; the aesthetics of live rock presentation; and the economics and  marketing of live rock aquaculture. Recent federal and state restrictions have constrained  the collections of natural live rock (a $10,000,000 year business) in all state and federal  waters. Only aquaculture offers a viable solution to revitalizing this business in the  continental United States. Students and faculty, with the assistance of partners, will work  in three teams (Aquaculture, Environmental and Marketing) over a three year period to  address the research concerns mentioned above. Students working in each team will not  only gain applied experience of the particular team discipline but will be provided with the  opportunity of transferring and applying what they learn in the classroom to an applied  project. They will also not only gain the cognitive knowledge/skills of the other team areas  but will gain interpersonal/team working skills by working closely with the members of the  other teams and partners. Evaluation of the project will be accomplished by: traditional  and alternative assessment measures of student achievement such as grades, project  assignments, field assignments, testing, etc; student satisfaction surveys; responses to  research questions and reports; and by yearly reviews by the HCC Aquaculture and EST  Advisory Committees, and the project partners. Knowledge gained from the results of this  project will be made available to the aquaculture industry, the regulatory community and  educational community by workshops, reports and other publications .",
