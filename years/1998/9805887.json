Ou-Yang, Lehigh University  An approach to measure the in-situ instantaneous interparticle forces in colloidal suspensions using dual optical tweezers and phase lock-in methods is investigated.  The principle of measurement will be tested by conducting experiments to determine the minimum distance between tweezers, the measurement accuracy of the interparticle separation distance, the dynamic range of the force measurement, and the reduction of particle heating caused by optical tweezers.   The tests will focus on the hydrodynamic interactions between two particles, by comparing the experimental measurements to Stokes's drag force prediction.  One sphere (1-2 microns in diameter) will be trapped in a fixed position by strong tweezers (size of about 0.5 to 1 micron), and another sphere will be held at a given distance into oscillating weaker tweezers.  The laser has 1.06 micron wavelength in order to reduce particle heating.   The interparticle distance will be independently measured by using image analysis.   The proposed approach would allow for interparticle force measurements in dynamic conditions in colloidal suspensions.  Such measurements are of fundamental importance and are not possible by other means.  If successful, the method would have relevance to understanding a broad group of industrial and biological suspensions. The proposed project will explore the feasibility and the technical limits of the methods.  ***",
