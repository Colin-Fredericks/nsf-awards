Peters  Florida State University      Recent large donations of Ephemeroptera (mayflies) to Florida   A&M University have  made this university collection one of the largest and most  significant collections of mayflies in North America. As these  donations exceed normal growth, this project is concerned with  the management and preservation of incoming collections and  modernization of the entire  Ephemeroptera collection. Specific objectives are a) to continue  to assure the integrity of all  type and voucher material arriving at Florida A&M University;  (b) to upgrade storage of the  Berner collection;  (c) to integrate the Traver and Edmunds  collections into the existing  Ephemeroptera collection; and  (d) to house the Ephemeroptera  collection in steel storage  cabinets in such a way as to make them easily accessible for  revisionary work and future  growth management.    The donations include the transfer of the entire Berner  collection (including the Lyman  collection) from the University of Florida and a portion of the  Edmunds and Traver collections  from the University of Utah to Florida A&M University. The  greatest significance in the Berner  collection is the historical record for the mayflies of the  Southeastern United States.  Additional material comes from many other areas, including  Africa. The Berner collection is a  specimen-based collection, so that any published record can be  accessed by specimen in a  few minutes using a system of card catalogs and indices. In the  time the Berner collection  has been at Florida A&M University, it has been the source of  frequent loans as revisions of  North American mayfly genera or species must return to the  published Berner distributions.  The Edmunds and Traver collections are worldwide in scope, with  greatest strength in the  Neotropical representatives of Leptophlebiidae and  Leptohyphidae. The Edmunds and Traver collections contain type  material for over 100 sp ecies, including 55 primary types.    Specific curatorial needs for these collections include  replacing all bakelite lids on 16  oz jars with polypropylene closures, replacing all rubber-lined  closures on a 50-year  assortment of different sized jars with standard-sized museum  jars (16-oz, 32-oz) and  polypropylene closures, and disintegrating stoppers. All  collections, those in racks and those  in jars, will be placed into steel storage cabinets. For future  access, they will be stored  phylogenetically by family or superfamily group. All type  material in alcohol will be curated  into a double storage vial system (inner and outer vials) in  museum jars.",
