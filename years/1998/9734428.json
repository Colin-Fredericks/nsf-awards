 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the research project is to  design simple, efficient, and robust mechanisms to   improve the performance of Transmission Control  Protocol (TCP) in mixed wired/wireless and ad hoc  communication networks.  The basic approach is to   study how the soon-to-be-standardized Selective   Acknowledgment (SACK) feature of TCP, together with  knowledge of the statistical behavior of wireless  links, can be used to decouple the error recovery and  flow control functions of TCP by distinguishing between  transient and persistent packet loss.  The network  will be modeled within a stochastic framework,  guided and validated by computer simulation.  Rigorous  mathematical techniques, as well as extensive computer  simulation, will be employed to design and analyze the   performance of each mechanism.  In order to accurately   evaluate the performance of the mechanisms, they will   be implemented experimentally under a wide variety   of real-world conditions using channel emulation hardware.  The education plan can be summarized as one of utilizing   the vast resources at the University of Michigan,   participating in several initiatives in curriculum   development, involving undergraduate students in research,   and developing Web-based Matlab modules.  http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~wass/nsf/career.html",
