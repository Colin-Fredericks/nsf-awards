 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of deviant behavior in space missions and polar expeditions.  It will examine the effects of independent variables such as heterogeneity of crew and mission duration on behavior and performance, within the context of structural and ecological sociology. A key purpose is to generate baseline data about dysfunctional acts in extreme environments in order to construct applicable theory for living and working in remote and isolated places. The study examines the key social structural variables thought to correspond with deviance in extreme environments and a substantial sample of space and polar groups.     After full operationalization of what is meant by a deviant act in an extreme environment, multiple coders will extract deviant acts from approximately 100 space and polar field expeditions. Once occurrences of deviant acts and related data have been extracted from mission and expedition records, ANCOVA with nested terms will be employed to examine numbers of deviant acts against their crew sizes, heterogeneity, and mission duration in each mission and expedition. Data will be input according to the separate quarters of a mission and expedition regardless of the mission/expedition length. This methodology seeks to examine how crew size, heterogeneity, and mission duration structure deviance in extreme environments. In particular, it will test the hypothesis of increased deviance around or after the midway point of extreme environment expeditions. The methodology also allows a comparison of these points by space and by polar field milieu if narrative sources permit.    This study tests the scope of general theories of human behavior by applying them to life in extreme environments.  The results of this pioneering study will generate new insights and stimulate further research in a substantive area where little systematic research has been done previously.  The findings will also guide future planning for long duration space missions.",
