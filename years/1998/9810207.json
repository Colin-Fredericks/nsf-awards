 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point (UWSP) recently  implemented a Freshman Interest Group (FIG) initiative on its  campus.  The program has generally been successful; however, the  success has not been universal.  The single science, mathematics,  engineering and technology (SME&T)-related FIG attracted only 12  students in its inaugural year and seven in its second year--all  male.  The experience highlights the difficulties regional  universities may experience implementing national educational  reform models as well as the need for a SME&T-related initiative  that targets women.  This project's goal is to develop the  resource referred to as the \"second tier,\" those who can do  science, but opt not to.  The knowledge gained by identifying  those components that appear most effective could reform the way  science is taught.  The specific objectives are to:  create a  Women in Science learning community; enhance classroom  instruction with study groups; provide technology training,  career information, role models, and related work experience;  acquaint faculty members with gender issues; and identify the  facets of the intervention that are most effective.  The program  includes an interdisciplinary course that participants will take  as a cohort.  The curriculum will be enhanced with field trips,  guest speakers, and career information.  Mentor-led study groups,  a technology workshop, a family open house, and SME&T-related  student employment will provide additional scaffolding.",
