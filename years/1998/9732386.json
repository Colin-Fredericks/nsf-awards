 "awd_abstract_narration": "SGER:  Supplementary monitoring of ENSO signals in the Eastern North Pacific  Robert Smith  To understand the effects of climate variability on marine life in the eastern North Pacific requires that we know what the oceanic environment is, how it is changing, and what the oceanic environment was in the past.  In recent weeks and months there has been mounting evidence of the onset of a major El Ni\u00b9o in the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean.  The relatively scarce observations from past El Ni\u00b9o episodes show that the coastal ocean along the west coast of North America can be significantly affected, manifesting higher sea surface temperatures and coastal sea levels, lower primary and secondary productivity, a deeper thermocline, and enhanced poleward flow over the shelf.  However, the scant evidence, from different locations at different times, also suggests that the extent, intensity and nature of the effects may differ among different episodes.  The present onset of El Ni\u00b9o, combined with the beginning of the GLOBEC Northeast Pacific Pilot Monitoring effort, provides a unique opportunity to gather a more complete data set.  We are currently funded as part of the GLOBEC pilot monitoring program.  This proposal seeks to initiate the GLOBEC pilot monitoring program along two transects off the central Oregon coast (44.6\u00dd and 43.2\u00ddN) in November 1997 several months earlier than planned, and to extend the monitoring in November 1977, February and August 1998 to include northern California sections (41.9\u00ddN and 38.7\u00dd N) where regular hydrographic sampling programs have existed in the past two decades.  This would augment five cruises in 1998 that will monitor the hydrography, subsurface currents derived from ADCP measurements, nutrients, chlorophyll, and zooplankton species composition and abundance.  If the present ENSO event becomes a full El Nino, occupations of these lines in November 1997, February and August 1998 would help determine the extent, duration, and evolution of the anomalous conditions.",
