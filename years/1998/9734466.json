 "awd_abstract_narration": "9734466  Friedman  The project is designed to begin to elucidate the structural basis of transcription termination.  Transcriptional termination appears to result from multiple weak interactions among various factors and between them and the RNA polymerase.  Two proteins that have been identified as being critical for proper transcription termination are nusG and rho.  E. coli rho is known to be a helicase that unwinds the RNA transcript from the transcription bubble at rho-dependent termination sites, while nusG acts as an adaptor between rho and the RNA polymerase.  The nusG homolog from T. maritima has been demonstrated to be readily cleaved by proteolysis into two fragments.  The structures of both fragments will be determined by x-ray crystallography.  At the same time, expression systems for the T. maritima rho protein will be constructed from presently available clones.  Crystallization experiments of this protein will also be conducted, both with the intact protein and protein proteolytically cleaved to separate the RNA-binding domain.  Finally, potential interactions between the T. maritima nusG and rho proteins will be investigated to determine if they also show the same interaction which is seen in their E. coli counterparts.  If this interaction is seen, crystallization trials on a complex of the two proteins will be initiated.    On the education side of this CAREER proposal, a new set of hypertext-based curriculum materials will be developed.  These materials will be designed to present biology in a \"vertical\" direction, focusing on the connections between different levels of organization within a biological function or organ system.  The vertical organization of the curriculum material should help communicate to under-graduate students how molecular structure underlies biological processes.  It should also provide upper-level biology undergraduates with an alternative view of their biological knowledge, thereby solidifying what they have been taught in their introductory classes.   This combination of research and educational projects will help further integrate structural biology into the mainstream of biology.  The research component will bring a new area of  biological research under structural investigation, while the education component will help integrate our present knowledge of structural biology into the undergraduate curriculum.",
