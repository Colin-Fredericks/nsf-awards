The project will be established in a region with 238 candidate rural schools, which enroll 11,000 American Indian students, and a total of 173,503 students, half of whom are economically and educationally disadvantaged.  The planning process will entail hosting a series of facilitated and structured dialogues among the parents, community members, teachers, school administrators, and representatives of higher education, private industry, and community groups in each of five areas of the region, in order to build a shared vision of standards-based education and goals; and will also take the initial steps toward establishing the long-term, divers educational community needed to support significant systemic educational reform in the region, particularly in the subject areas of mathematics, science and technology.    3      1",
