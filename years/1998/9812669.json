Ten companies related to the repair and rehabilitation of buildings and bridges using composite materials have expressed an interest in joining this center.  The proposed I/UCRC will address:   (1) development, understanding, manufacturing, and use of more durable construction materials; (2) installation processes and engineering design; (3) monitoring and evaluation of repaired structures; (4) standardization and code approval of products and design protocols; and (5) education and technology transfer.   Thirteen faculty plan to work in the center from four departments: civil engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical/aerospace engineering mechanics, and chemistry.  In addition to its research activities, the center proposes curricular changes at the university to incorporate its research results into education as well as providing technical training for the construction industry workforce.",
