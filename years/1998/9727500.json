 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   program provides continued support for studies of fundamental reactions   of coordinated ligands by Dr. Joseph L. Templeton, Department of   Chemistry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  Research will be   carried out in three areas all involving the synthesis of organometallic   complexes utilizing the tridentate   hydridotris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)borate ligand, Tp'.  The strategy for   each area is to explore fundamental  reactivity patterns of coordinated   substrate ligands.  The first area extends the chemistry of chiral d4   complexes of tungsten previously shown to successfully control   stereochemistry at ligand beta-sites.  A cationic methylene carbene   complex will be used for stoichiometric and catalytic reaction studies of   substrate ligands.  For example, catalytic aziridine formation occurs by   reaction of ethyl diazoacetate with imine adducts. Single enantiomer   studies will be pursued.  The second and main area of the project   involves the use of a new high oxidation state d2 tungsten oxo system   which simultaneously accommodates both pi-acid and pi-base ligands.  New   d2 tungsten complexes should yield chiral organometallic derivatives that   contain sigma or pi bound organic ligands.  Preliminary results show   interesting and different reactivities such as ligand coupling reactions   (C-C bond formation) and proton addition at the oxo group converting  W=O   to W-OH, a rare example of an organometallic terminal hydroxo ligand.    These reactions will be extended to seek catalytic transfer of nitrene   and carbene ligands and  to generate chiral d2 complexes suitable for   promoting Lewis acid assisted organic transformations.  The third area   involves the preparation of chiral Tp' derivatives of Pt(IV) from known   hydrido complexes in order to generate vacant sites for electrophilic   activation of organic substrates.  This work has potential for great   impact because it may give insight into how C-H bond activation reactions   work in electrophilic, late transition metal complexes.    This project will increase our fundamental knowledge of transition metal   mediated reactions of organic substrates.  In addition, these and related   compounds may have applications in promoting or catalyzing important   organic transformations, including ones of interest to the chemical and   pharmaceutical industries.",
