 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative and coordinated effort to provide the tools and the scientific knowledge base that will allow a rapid expansion of basic and applied research in functional genomics for the entire community of soybean researchers, and consequently those interested in all legumes. Soybean has many biological and economic features that make it attractive for moving rapidly with the application of functional genomics. Soybean is the third most economically valuable crop to the U.S. agricultural economy. Soybean accounts for over 80% of the edible consumption of fats and oils in the U.S. The U.S. accounts for fully 69% of the world soybean trade. Annual production value is approximately 17 billion ($U.S.) and the value of exports exceeds 6 billion ($U.S.). This project builds on an existing partnership with the soybean grower associations, who are funding the creation of a soybean expressed sequence tag (EST) database that forms the foundation of this project. The specific objectives and approaches are: \r\n1. To develop the tools of functional genomics for use in soybean. These will include testing of the feasibility of high-density arrays, DNA microarrays, and SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) techniques with appropriate tools for data analysis. \r\n2. To apply the tools of functional genomics to develop baseline, global expression data for certain tissues and stages of development to aid in identification of useful promoters and genes and to test these approaches for selected biological questions. Identification of genes involved in biological pathways unique to plants including cell wall synthesis and flavonoid metabolism, is a specific focus as is developing detailed expression pattems in root development under different stress conditions. \r\n3. To create a framework for physical mapping and comparative genomics of soybean with other plants by isolation and end sequence analysis of bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) that represent loci identified and mapped by simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) that are dispersed throughout the genome. \r\n4. To host workshops on functional genomics approaches in order to stimulate transfer of the technology to other soybean researchers and thus enhance application of these approaches to a wide range of biological problems. \r\nThe proposed research will result in development and distribution of tools for global gene expression and physical mapping. Public information to be derived from the project includes release of: (a) baseline global expression data for different organ systems in soybean; (b) a set of 3' sequences from 30,000 unique soybean cDNAs; and (c) genomic sequence data that will mark over 1000 positions on the soybean genetic map. Many questions of biological importance can be gleaned from the development and wide distribution of these tools to be used for global analysis of gene expression and organization by any researchers who address fundamental problems on the organization and expression of plant genes.\r\nDeliverables and data for the project will be posted at the following web sites: http://web.ahc.umn.edu/biodata/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/index.html for sequence and SAGE data and analysis and http://soybeangenomics.cropsci.uiuc.edu and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ for microarray data. \r\n\r\n",
