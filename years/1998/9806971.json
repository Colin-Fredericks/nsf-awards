 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Inca Empire was the largest state to develop in the pre-Columbian New World. The last in a series of complex Andean societies, it emerged in the central Andean highlands of Peru, expanded across the western highlands and coast of South America and ultimately encompassed a territory that stretched from modern day Columbia to Chile. By the time of European contact, the Inca ruled a population of at least eight million people from their capital city in the Cusco Valley. Despite the importance of the Cusco Valley in the prehistory of the Americas, it remains the last great center of civilization in the New World to be systematically surveyed, and many of its archaeological remains are rapidly being destroyed by urban growth. While best known for the Incas, the Cusco Valley has a long prehistory and data from this area are relevant to a number of research questions. It was occupied by at least 1000 BC by small groups of agricultralists and underwent various periods of indigenous development and foreign influence. At least two other highland Andean empires had an impact on the valley.  With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Brian Bauer will continue his survey of this region. Building on two previous field seasons, he will complete his 100% surface examination of the Cusco region. He will document the location and distribution of all visible archaeological sites in the Cusco valley and also collect surface materials at all  in order to date and determine their function. Survey teams will also note the location of culturally significant prehistoric features such as agricultural and habitation terraces, canals, roads bridges and storehouses. Spanish eyewitness accounts provide the best available information to on the Inca and Dr. Bauer and his colleagues will continue their examination of these chronicles. They will attempt to match archaeological and written data. On the basis of this work they will attempt to gain insight into how complex societies and early states emerge and are maintained. The data they collect will be widely used by other archaeologists.",
