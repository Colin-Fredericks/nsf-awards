It is a five-year career development plan that integrates research and teaching goals.\r\nThe major scientific objective is to provide a quantitative process model for the phase changes (solid or liquid) of internally mixed inorganic atmospheric aerosol particles.  The model will consider water-soluble compounds (e.g., ammonium sulfate) and water-insoluble chemical substances (e.g., titanium dioxide).  A series of laboratory experiments will be carried out to provide empirical input to the process model.  The investigator will study the efflorescence, the deliquescence, and freezing properties of the mixed-phase aerosol particles.  Infrared spectroscopy (IR) will be used to investigate phase transformations of the internally mixed aerosol systems.\r\nThe educational plan consists of three goals: (1) curriculum development to produce two new courses; (2) instructional tool development to consist of an electronic teaching module on surface chemistry that is linked to the internet; and (3) undergraduate research training.  Two innovations proposed as part of the teaching activities are: (1) a summer research experience for two undergraduate students; and (2) incorporation of internet-based technology as part of the course content.  The summer research experience will include a summer short course on research methodology.  Results from the summer research will be linked directly in electronic format to the new courses.\r\n",
