 "awd_abstract_narration": "The foci of this research are two-fold.  First, a novel two stage process   will be developed for the preparation of carbon networks.  The initial   step involves organization/orientation of polyvalent monomer units in a   lattice.  The second step consists of polymerizing and crosslinking the   monomers in their lattice positions.  Materials reminiscent of zeolites   should result.  The second area of emphasis is on diamond film growth.    Small organic substrates will be used to probe hypothesized carbon   incorporation mechanisms.  With this renewal award, the Organic and   Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Ken S.   Feldman of the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State University.    Professor Feldman will focus his work on the design and synthesis of   covalently linked, periodic one-,two- and three-dimensional networks,   composed mainly of carbon.  Theses systems have potential to address   specific goals in separations and catalysis technology.  In addition, the   mechanism of carbon incorporation during Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)   diamond film growth will be pursued.  This knowledge will provide a   foundation from which subsequent studies on substrate compatibility and   film surface modification can be initiated.",
