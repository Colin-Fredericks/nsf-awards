Asymmetric quinols, polysubstituted hydroquinones and alkylated   quinones are the target molecules to be prepared.    With this Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) award, the Organic   and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research and   educational efforts of Dr. Carl T. Wigal of the Department of Chemistry   at Lebanon Valley College.  Professor Wigal will focus his work on   developing methodology for the use of organocadmium reagent for the   synthesis of quinols and quinones.  The The results from these studies   will provide the basis for designed syntheses of new materials and   natural products important to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.    Dr. Wigal will carry out the research with the help of undergraduate   students.",
