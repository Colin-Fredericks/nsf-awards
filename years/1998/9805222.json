 "awd_abstract_narration": "Qiu  9805222  This is a fundamental research project in the field of magnetism.  The  research  is  focused  on  the  properties  of  artificially  structured thin magnetic films. The objective is an understanding  of   the  role  of  lattice  symmetry-breaking  on  the  magnetic  anisotropy in these materials. The magnetic anisotropy is a major  determinant   of  the  magnetic  properties  of  the   materials,  particularly there properties as candidates for magnetic  storage  media. Nanometer-sized atomic steps on a controlled surface  will  be  created to break the four-fold rotation symmetry to induce  a  uniaxial  magnetic anisotropy within the film plane.  This  step-  induced magnetic anisotropy and its effect on the two-dimensional  (2D)    magnetic   phase   transition   will   be    investigated  systematically as a function of the step-density. A novel  aspect  of  the  project is to employ a curved substrate  as  a  possible  means  of  controlling the step-density in a continuous way.  All  samples  will  be  grown  by Molecular  Beam  Epitaxy  (MBE)  and  characterized  by  Reflection  High-Energy  Electron  Diffraction  (RHEED),  Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), Auger  Electron  spectroscopy (AES) and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy  (STM).  The  magnetic  properties  of the films will be measured  in  situ  by  Surface Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (SMOKE) technique.  %%%  This is a fundamental research project in the field of magnetism.  Rapid  development in the information storage technology  demands  an  understanding  of the magnetic behavior of materials  at  the  atomic  scale.  The goal of this proposal is  to  gain  a  deeper  understanding on how the magnetic anisotropy of a magnet will  be  affected  by  limiting  the size of the magnetic  at  the  atomic  scale.  To realize this goal, well-defined atomic steps  will  be  used  to  break the rotation symmetry of the continuous  surface.  The  step  induced magnetic anisotropy and its effect on  the  2D  magnetic   pha se   transition   will   then   be   systematically  investigated  as a function of the step-density. State-of-the-art  techniques such as the Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) and  Scanning  Tunneling  Microscopy (STM) will be applied to  this  project  to  fabricate  and  characterize the thin films at the atomic  scale.  Success  of  this  project  will be important  not  only  to  the  understanding  of  two-dimensional magnetism,  but  also  to  the  development of new magnetic devices for practical applications.  ***",
