 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAPO  9809837    This award supports a partnership between the Carnegie Museum of Natural History (CMNH) and the University of Pittsburgh Department of Geology and Planetary Science (G&PS).  The primary objective of the partnership is to provide an understanding of geology and the environment, including the role of geologic processes on human activity, and the impact of humans on the biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and global climate, to a broad spectrum of the general public.  CMNH has excellent facilities, a large and diverse audience, and a strong staff involved in Earth science research and exhibit development.  Collaboration with G&PS would expand this base of expertise to include an earth science group involved in research and teaching in three primary areas: (1) geologic and environmental hazards, (2) planetary science, and (3) plate tectonics.    This collaboration will take advantage of the strengths of both institutions to link graduate and undergraduate training with precollegiate aand non-classroom geoscience education.  Specifically, an integrated approach will be taken that involves partnering for (1) development of earth science-focused museum exhibits; (2) a distinguished geoscience lecture series aimed at the general public, and   (3) involvement of talented minority high school students as interns in this process.  These activities will enhance earth science education outside the classroom, involve students from high school to graduate level with interdisciplinary earth systems science research, and aid in development of programs to encourage minority high school students to pursue careers in geoscience.  Educational materials developed will be extended to a worldwide audience through WWW site development and interactive museum exhibits.",
