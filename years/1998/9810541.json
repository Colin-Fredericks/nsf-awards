 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810541  Pierson   This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project aims to develop a portable fiber-optic biosensor that has the potential to provide rapid and sensitive procedures for pathogen detection.  A fluorescence biosensor has been developed to detect Salmonella in food samples and will be converted into a viable commercial product.  The instrument will utilize immunomagnetic microspheres to capture pathogens and fluorescent labeled antibodies in a one-step operation for detection.  After labeling the target cells on microspheres, the complex will be magnetically focused in front of optical fibers for excitation and detection of the fluorescence labeled organisms.  A modulated diode laser will be sued to decrease interference from ambient light and increase sensitivity.  Focusing the immunomagnetic beads has the potential to eliminate interference from the background solution, and increase the sensitivity and speed of the assay, making this applicable for detection of pathogens in the field.  The USDA Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) program is designed to ensure safe food supplies and food production operations.   This program is designed to prevent contamination during processing and will require monitoring of E. coli and Salmonella at slaughterhouses and raw meat processing operations.  Current microbial testing methods are either sensitive or rapid, but the combination of both qualities is an unfulfilled goal.   This project will result in both rapid and sensitive testing for Salmonella and other food pathogens such as E. coli Camplobacter, and Vibrio sp.",
