One of the most important is the Student Paper Competition at the IMS. This selective program brings the world's best students together in an integrated program in which they present their work not only to a technical audience but again to a group of judges.  The program helps develop the students' technical acumen as well as their communication and presentation skills.   It also helps introduce then to the international technical community and helps to build a community students who will lead the next generation of microwave engineers.\r\nThe IMS provides financial support of various forms but does not reimburse travel expenses.  Travel support from NSF will ensure that the program is open to the widest range of interested applicants from U.S. Universities.\r\n\r\n",
