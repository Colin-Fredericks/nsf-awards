 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802997  Freiman    A conference will be held December 14-18, 1997 on  theoretical and experimental aspects of molecular  electronics with an emphasis on material science  considerations. As the microelectronics field looks beyond  silicon to evaluate different emerging fields for possible  future technology, and as atomic level resolution probes  have become available for accessing and manipulating  individual molecules and molecular assemblies, molecular  electronics has become a timely topic. New techniques will  be discussed for making precise size oligomers, as well as  new techniques for attaching them to designed surfaces. The  conference will also concentrate on possible techniques for  creating molecular circuits and methods needed to be able to  interact with single molecules. The program is organized  around 31 invited speakers, and both contributed papers and  posters are scheduled. Special efforts have been made to  recruit a diverse group of participants, including foreign  and American scientists, younger and older researchers, and  industrial, national laboratory and academic researchers.  Objectives are to stimulate communications among the  chemistry, physics, engineering and materials science  communities working in this and related fields, and to  formulate and delineate critical research necessary to move  molecular electronics concepts closer to technological  success. The conference is expected to provide an effective  forum for discussion of critical scientific issues and  directions in Molecular Electronics. Along with the  opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is  expected that new ties will be established between  universities, research institutions, and industry.  %%%   An evaluation of the progress and status of Molecular  Electronics and related materials issues, especially  critical materials and device related research areas, and  the relationship of materials research to device fabrication  along with current assessments of the most importan t  developments in this field will be of great value to the  understanding and enhanced utilization of materials in  computing, data processing, and communications.  ***",
