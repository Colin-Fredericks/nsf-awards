 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9733475  Chong  Microprocessor performance continues to increase faster than  memory performance, so that computer systems face a memory  bottleneck.  The goal of this project is to distribute logic  within memory systems so that some computations can be  performed in the memory system without transferring data to  the processor. By fabricating field-programmable gate arrays  and memory on the same chip, computations for fine-grained  data manipulation can be distributed to the memory system at  run time to speed up specific applications.A crucial  research issue in such a design is the partitioning of  computations between high-performance processors and the  distributed logic. This project is investigating this  partitioning on a range of appilications, including integer  programming for compiler register allocation, filters for  image and video editing, internet routing, graph matching  for intrusion detection, and protein sequence matching.  Educational plans include the updating of several existing  courses in computer architecture, the development of new  courses in reconfigurable computing, and the incorporation  of undergraduate research into the project.  Expected  outcomes of this project include a methodology for designing  reconfigurable memory systems and using them in  computations, an infrastructure of simulation tools and  hardware prototypes, students trained in applications-driven  system design, and web-based educational software to support  collaborative projects in computer architecture.  ***",
