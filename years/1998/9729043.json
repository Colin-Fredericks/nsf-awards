 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues the preparation of a linguistic  database of the languages of the minority peoples living in the  Vietnam-China Borderlands, with special reference to phonological  and lexical features of groups who have migrated from China into  Vietnam.        This project is significant because it addresses historical  and migratory questions about the arrival of the Tai and Kadai,  Hmong-Mien, and Tibeto-Burman groups in northern Vietnam (Haut  Tonkin). Brethren of these peoples were to become the nation  states of Thailand, Laos, and Burma (Myanmar). Northern Vietnam  has served for centuries as a first station on a grand  Volkerwanderung of many ethnic groups from their original  homelands in South China to sites further south; indeed 25 out of  30 of northern Vietnam's minority groups are also found in China.  The Thai end of this chain has been studied in some depth by Thai  and foreign scholars over the course of the last 35 years. To a  lesser degree, the Chinese end has been investigated by many  since 1982. The middle portion, however, \"the Vietnam  connection\", has remained linguistically poorly known up to now.       The data gathering process of the project will involve  making high quality tape and DAT recordings with microphones,  performing computerized speech analysis with the CECIL  software-hardware package, and studying voice quality (phonation  type) by means of the Rothenburg Mask.        The end product of this study will be: (a) a CD-ROM with  digital audio files of all recorded lexical data readable by both  DOS and Mac platforms, (b) a website at http:\\\\ling.uta.edu\\  where all this audio data, transcribed forms in MS Excel format,  and analyses can be downloaded from any location worldwide, and  (c) a third volume in the series of books Comparative Kadai to  complement the first two volumes on Tai and Kam-Sui languages.",
