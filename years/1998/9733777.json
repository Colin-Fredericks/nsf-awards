 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shultz  9733777      The arthropods (arachnids, crustaceans, insects, centipedes, etc.) are  a very ancient and diverse group of animals that use many different  methods of locomotion. In all cases, locomotion depends on the  efficient interaction of two systems, namely, a skeletomuscular system  that provides the mechanical structures used in propulsion and a  neuromuscular system that controls the timing of movements. Recent  research on a wide range of animals suggests that evolution in the  skeletomuscular system is relatively fast and evolution of the  neuromuscular system is relatively slow. The PI will test this idea by  examining relative rates of evolution in skeletomuscular and  neuromuscular features of the locomotor mechanisms of two arthropod  groups, the chelicerates (spiders, scorpions, etc.) and the  centipedes. This will be accomplished by mapping skeletomuscular and  neuromuscular features on phylogenetic trees and determining the  relative placement of the two types of characters in evolutionary  history. Fast-evolving characters are expected to appear near the ends  of the branches in the tree, while the slowevolving features are  expected to appear near the base. The results of the project may show  that there are general patterns in the evolution of form and function.",
