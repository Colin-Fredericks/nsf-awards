 "awd_abstract_narration": "Time varying environments and limited battery energy are two key hurdles on the  route to distributed multimedia systems with wireless network links.  This  project is exploring architectures, protocols, and algorithms to overcome these  hurdles for mobile users.  In particular, the research is exploring the use  reconfigurability in wireless nodes to allow algorithms and protocols to adapt  to evolving environments.  The reconfigurable wireless node leads to interesting  system-level concepts such as hardware applets, in which hardware datapaths can  be downloaded and instantiated on demand from network servers.    The educational component of the project is based on tightly integrating the  proposed research with new graduate and undergraduate courses.  The research  topics will be explored in project-oriented graduate courses on mobile multimedia  information systems and wireless terminal design.  Selected prototyping tasks  will be used as projects in undergraduate design courses.",
