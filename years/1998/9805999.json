 "awd_abstract_narration": "The somatosensory system involves the sense of touch, and the  term haptic perception includes how objects are recognized by  touch, as well as their spatial relations.  In an interesting  parallel with visual processing, there is evidence that the brain  contains two pathways for information about touch, one for  perceiving 'what' an object is, and the other for 'where' it is.  This project will utilize current imaging technology (brain  scanning by fMRI and MEG techniques) with human subjects to  identify and localize the neural activity in tasks designed to  utilize primarily one or the other pathway in response to tactile  stimuli.  Differences in the two types of tactile processing will  reflect functional specialization in the somatosensory system.     This award is in the Professional Opportunities for Women in  Research & Education (POWRE) activity of NSF.  It will provide a  young woman a unique opportunity a a different campus to broaden  her technical expertise in the field of cognitive neuroscience by  getting training in neuroimaging, and bring that expertise back to  enhance her teaching and research at her home institution, and so  will have a significant impact on her career and on the home  institution.   The scientific results also will have an impact  because a better understanding of haptic perception is important  to sensory neuroscience in general, and could lead to substantial  advances in artificial or assistive technologies, such as aids for  the blind and for robotics.",
