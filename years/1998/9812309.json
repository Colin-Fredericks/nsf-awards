Klamut of the Institute of Low Temperature and Structure Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences as Wroclaw.  Two years ago, the first workshop in this series provided a unique opportunity for Polish and U.S. scientists to meet and develop lasting interactions.  It also provided for a young Polish researchers forum to meet with the leaders in this field, attend their lectures and learn of the latest developments.  The second workshop is tentatively scheduled to be held in Poland on August 17-21, 1998.  Six of the twelve U.S. speakers will be with the Science and Technology Center for Superconductivity.\r\n\r\nThis research in physics fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
