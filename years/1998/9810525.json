 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mike Snyder, Director of the Pacific Rim Initiative, and other staff of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) will provide logistical support for a group of 20 high school students and their chaperones to attend a Youth Science Festival sponsored by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC), hosted by Korea in Seoul,  August 14-20, 1998. The U.S. students will be selected from nominations provided by PI's who have received NSF Young Scholar awards.  At this event, they will join contingents from the 18 member economies of APEC.  The Festival's objectives include introducing young people to various fields of science and technology as future career possibilities, and fostering mutual understanding and future cooperation among budding scientists and engineers of the region.   The  Festival will feature exhibits, demonstrations, presentations and experiments in a wide range of science and technology fields, some by senior researchers and educators and some by the young participants, as well as cultural events, field trips, and social activities.   The PI will work with the U.S. travelers to fulfill all requirements and arrangements for the delegation to travel to Korea and participate in the festival. In addition, through guidance before and during the trip and follow-up afterwards, the PI will endeavor to ensure a meaningful cross-cultural experience for the participants.",
