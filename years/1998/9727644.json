 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727644  Strickland  The Atlanta Urban Systemic Initiative (AUSI) proposes to aggressively advance the educational system in mathematics science and technology for all its students.  The AUSI will accomplish this task through a strategic plan adopted by the Atlanta Board of Education (ABE).  The new strategic plan includes provisions to provide all K-12 teachers of mathematics and science with the knowledge, skills, curriculum, assessment, equipment, and materials necessary to implement a standards-based mathematics and science program for all students.  Administrators, instructional specialists, counselors, and paraprofessionals will be included in professional development activities to ensure implementation of a standards-based approach to the teaching and learning of mathematics and science.  To facilitate this change district-wide policies have been adopted to support reform activities. The ABE has reallocated significant funding to support the integration of technology into the teaching and learning of mathematics and science.  Special efforts have also been undertaken to garner and maintain support from the community to promote educational reform and help sustain support and enrichment for all students.    To accomplish the goals of the new strategic plan, the AUSI will provide all APS students with the fundamentals of mathematics and science so that their understanding, ability, and academic achievement enables them to perform at or above their peers from around the world while experiencing success in the 21st century.  Five objectives will support proposed goals: (1) the institution of a stimulating learning environment which builds upon personal and cultural experiences of each learner in achieving success in a standards-based approach to the teaching and learning of mathematics and science;    (2) an array of assessment measures to gauge student progress; (3) continuous improvement in the mathematics and science instructional workforce, inclusive of teachers, administrators, and other  school staff: (4) the adoption or mending of policies and procedures to ensure implementation of AUSI; and (5) the development of a community support system that actively engages all members of the learning community in contributing to the mathematics and science achievement of all students.",
