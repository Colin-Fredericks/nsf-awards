The  work  focuses  on  anisotropy  of  electrical  conduction   in  in-plane  and  out-of-plane  directions,   using  extremely high quality and well-characterized single crystals  of  doped  cuprates. The PI will measure the doping, temperature  and  magnetic  field  dependences of these conductivity  anisotropies.  The  data  will  be  analyzed  for information  about  electronic  structure   and   conduction  mechanisms.  Single   crystals   of  YPrBa2Cu3O7  and  TlSr2LuCaCu2Oy  of  variable  dopings  will  be  investigated. C-axis transport mechanisms will be investigated by  comparing  behavior in systems with and without chains.  Evidence  will  be  sought  for a possible energy gap in the  normal  state  spectrum  of the CuO chains. Normal state conduction in  strongly  off-stoichiometry (under-doped and over-doped) cuprates  will  be  probed  by  suppressing superconductivity with  magnetic  fields.  Some  of  the  work  will  be carried out  at  the  NSF-supported  National  High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee FL.  This  work  is  expected  to advance fundamental understanding  of  the  normal  state  conduction properties and electronic structure  in  the   cuprates.  More  broadly,  the  results  from  this   basic  investigation  may include fundamental new physical  effects  and  also  may  provide  insight into appropriate  doping  schemes  to  facilitate  applications of cuprates for  electronic  sensors  or  devices.  This highly interdisciplinary project strongly involves  minority-group  graduate students who pursue thesis  research  at  both   laboratory  locations,  and  receive  excellent   training  beneficial  to  a  future  career  in  industry,  government   or  academia.  %%%  This experimental research project is concerns the  unusual  electrical properties and behavior of metallic oxides containing  copper oxide planes. Some of these materials are high temperature  superconductors, for example YBa2Cu3O7 which has a  superconducting transition temperature of about 92 degrees on the  Kelvin scale. The \"normal state\" properties of these conducting  oxides at high temperatures or when the superconductivity is  destroyed by an applied magnetic field, are the topics of this  research. There are suggestions that these materials, even in the  normal state,  conduct electricity in ways that are very  different from typical electrical conductors such as copper and  silicon. Clarifiying these novel electrical behaviors may  contribute to eventual applications of these materials in  electronic devices such as magnetic field sensors or even  computer logic devices. Some of the work will be carried out at  the NSF-supported National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in  Tallahassee FL. This highly interdisciplinary project strongly  involves minority-group graduate students who pursue thesis  research at both laboratory locations, and receive excellent  training beneficial to a future career in industry, government or  academia.  ***",
