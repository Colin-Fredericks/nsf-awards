 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the next century university education will be dramatically transformed by computer networks. Students may eventually be able to attend e university of their choice electronically while still living at home, something which could favorably impact families of modest means,. students with disabilities, or servicemen and women at military installations. Particular interest and attraction would be to work-at-home parents interested in pursuing a bachelors or advanced degree. Satellite transmission and multimedia displays have already begun this process. One difficulty that remains will be converting laboratory experiences to remote access. By their nature, laboratories remain in the curriculum because they teach the student many practical sills not found in other courses. Laboratories stress the importance of experimental methods such as instrumentation, measurement, and error control. This proposal focuses on one laboratory whose experiences could be encapsulated for remote leg. The approach is fairly generic and provides a model or how such techniques could be applied across a spectrum of laboratories. The courseware which we will develop will make the lab remotely accessible. This will enable students to create designs at home, implement them in a distant laboratory, and verify correct or incorrect operation with remotely accessible instruments. In the near term this will permit students on campus to have much greater access to the lab. but once the linkage works. students not on the main campus will be able to use it also. This remote distance access mode. long with various on line documents. will automatically guarantee that he concepts developed will be accessible to our colleagues over the internet. This will increase the impact of the SF investment, assuring that the results, code. and techniques would be readily disseminated to other institutions on a national scale, with man features of the approach being generic and applicable to other labs.",
