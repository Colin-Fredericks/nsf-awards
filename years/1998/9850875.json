 "awd_abstract_narration": "The students n undergraduate chemistry courses need exposure to modem computer controlled instrumentation in order to be properly trained to enter the work force. Modernization of our undergraduate curriculum is planned concurrent with the implementation of such instrumentation. Experiments not previously possible should become routine for a wide variety of our undergraduate students both chemistry majors, and non-majors. This particular program is targeted toward sophomore, junior senior classes and undergraduate research students.  The curriculum will be developed by replacing or upgrading two different t o spectrometers. Funds are requested for the purchase of a ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer to be used in physical and analytical laboratories for data acquisition and processing. This will allow the development of both kinetic and equilibrium experiments not possible currently through the computer interface of this instrument. The modernization of our superconducting nuclear magnetic resonance by replacing the controlling computer and modernization of the software will allow organic chemistry students to acquire spectra themselves or a number of organic experiments. This will also allow remote operation of the instrument and provisions are made so that our smaller sister institutions within the region will be able to carry out their own spectral determinations via the internet.  Integration of these instruments into our own undergraduate laboratory curriculum will significant facilitate the modernization of physical and analytical chemistry courses for both chemical engineer and chemistry majors students from the sophomore to he senior level. The development of hands on NMR spectral determination both here and by remote operation at smaller schools unable to afford NMR spectrometers, will significantly enhance organic chemistry for sophomore through senior students at all e schools involved.",
