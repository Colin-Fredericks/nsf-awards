 "awd_abstract_narration": "9734527  Short  The importance of studying cellular and physiological processes in higher organisms has become increasingly apparent as a way to discover how living organisms respond to their surroundings, how malfunction of these processes affects the organism, and how manipulation of these systems can yield important benefits.  Light regulation of development and gene expression has been the target of intensive research because of light's importance in the control of numerous processes at all stages of the plant life cycle.  The research undertaken in this project examines the interactions among light, sugar availability, and developmental stage in controlling accumulation of the family of pigments called anthocyanins. Anthocyanins and their precursors have been implicated in protection from damaging ultraviolet light, defense against herbivores and pathogens, interaction with beneficial microbes, floral coloration, and pollinator attraction.  They have also been suggested as potential tools to reduce heart disease and some cancers.  In this study, control mechanisms for anthocyanin production are being examined with a combination of molecular, genetic, and physiological tools.  By studying responses to light and sugars in existing and newly isolated mutants, the signal transduction pathways for these gene regulation mechanisms will be investigated, with the goal of determining how the pathways are integrated within the plant cell to modulate gene expression.  These studies will be performed within the context of teaching graduate students state-of-the-art methods in physiology, genetics and molecular biology, allowing these graduate to mentor undergraduates and improve their teaching abilities, and using the isolated mutants as part of an introductory undergraduate course in molecular plant physiology.",
