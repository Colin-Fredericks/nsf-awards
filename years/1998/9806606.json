 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806606  Anderson  The concept of tradeoff between current and future reproduction is central to life history theory, and so to our understanding of the evolution of reproductive characteristics. For birds, existing empirical demonstrations of this tradeoff are all flawed by poor choice of experimental species, short-term experiments, and drastic manipulations. Hence a fundamental tenet of evolutionary theory remains to be tested rigorously in this group. This research will continue an experimental test of the hypothesis that the cost of reproduction is a significant selective agent in the evolution of reproductive rate. Specifically, the study will test the hypothesis that adding only one additional offspring to a brood imposes a cost of reproduction large enough to impose natural selection against that experimental brood size. By using and appropriate study species yielding large samples and adopting a long-term perspective, this study avoids the flaws of previous work in this area. This study builds on 15 years of field work. Continuation of this research will allow the investigators to measure the direct cost of reproduction to parents, and the indirect cost of reproduction through offspring performance. These measurements will occur through climatic extremes, including El Ni o and La Ni a years, which will permit the analysis of climatic extremes as variables in this long-term study.",
