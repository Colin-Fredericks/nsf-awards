 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the second semester introductory physics laboratory, college sophomores confront several challenges to learning electricity and magnetism. These challenges include the abstract nature of the theory, the necessity of constructing specific mental visualizations, the invisible nature of the electric and magnetic forces, sophisticated mathematics, an unfamiliar vocabulary and lack of motivation. This project's primary goal is to redesign this laboratory's curriculum to increase the number of students who successfully meet these challenges.  The requested equipment includes laboratory apparatus, microcomputers, data acquisition hardware, and computer software. The strategies to achieve this goal include: (1) By automating selected experiments, students will complete this hands-on work more efficiently than at present. These time savings will allow the development of a series of Conceptual Computational Activities (CCA's) where students will construct and analyze many of the key visualizations inherent to electromagnetism. (2) Several new experiments are being developed so students may gain hands-on experience with important pieces of contemporary electromagnetic technology. These technologies are the building blocks for many of the appliances students use daily, but do not understand. This strategy improves the motivation and enjoyment students derive from this laboratory course. This project expects to achieve these outcomes:      Reorienting the traditional laboratory toward a greater emphasis on concept development.    Measuring the improvement in students' conceptual understanding.    Using educational research to guide development of new curricula which integrates computer data acquisition and interactive, Conceptual - Computational Activities (CCA's).    Making these curricula available to the national physics education community.    Strengthening Florida Tech's ability to serve as a resource to local high schools.",
