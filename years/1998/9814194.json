 "awd_abstract_narration": "SUMMARY    Support is provided for a two-part public workshop to consider the future  database needs of biologists studying Arabidopsis and other higher plants.  The emphasis will be on defining the needs of those who utilize high  density genetic maps, physical maps, YAC and BAC contigs and genomic or  cDNA sequence information to clone or characterize genes from intensively  studied organisms such as Arabidopsis. In addition, rapidly expanding  interest in the use of high density gene chips or gene microarrays will  create novel data management problems that if not addressed will limit the  utility of this emerging technology. The first session of the proposed  workshop will be focused on identifying the perceived future needs of the  Arabidopsis community. A group of sixteen to twenty people representing  various sectors of the community will discuss the various kinds of  information that is or will be available. This session will be held as an  adjunct workshop to the American Society of Plant Physiologists Meeting in  Madison, Wisconsin, USA on June 28. Written comments from the community at  large will be solicited via the Arabidopsis newsgroup, and all other plant-  related newsgroups, and made available to the participants in the workshop.  A written summary of the session will be prepared and submitted to the  participants and the community at large for comment. The second session of  the workshop will take place approximately two months later and will be  focused on the technical issues associated with addressing the needs  identified in the first session, and with reconsideration of any issues  raised during the public discussion of the proceedings of the first  workshop session. Approximately ten participants representing people with  extensive biological database experience and a subcommittee representing  the user community will discuss possible options for implementing an  information resource that will best meet the needs of the community as  described in the report of the first  session and the associated commentary  from the community. A subcommittee of invited participants representing the  two sessions will draft a consensus document representing a best effort  attempt to describe the current and future needs of various sectors of the  plant biology community, and to propose a realistic plan of action for the  next five to seven years.",
