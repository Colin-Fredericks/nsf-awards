The PI intends to study nonlinear elliptic and diffusion equations by   investigating the singularities their solutions may have. The particular   equations to be studied include Curve Shortening (and variations thereof)   Mean Curvature Flow, the Harmonic Map Flow, the Ricci Flow and the  Porous Medium Equation. The proposed method is to find formal asymptotic   expansions of solutions near their singularities, and then to devise analytical   methods to decide whether or not solutions with the found singularity types  can exist or not.    A good understanding of nonlinear diffusion equations and the singularities  of their solutions may lead to the resolutions of old problems in differential   geometry, as it has done in the past. Apart from this purely mathematical   interest, nonlinear diffusion equations appear in a wide range of science and   engineering contexts. E.g. the Porous Medium  Equation describes the flow  of a viscous material (like oil) through a porous medium (sand). So-   called \"Curve Shortening \" has been used both for enhancement and for   automated analysis of video images, and in particular medical MRI images.   A good understanding of nonlinear diffusion equations provides computer   scientists and engineers with a new set of mathematical operations which   they can use in image processing.       --Sigurd Angenent",
