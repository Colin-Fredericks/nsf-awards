Vijay              Abstract                     Proposal No:                       9726143                Proposal Type:             Investigator Initiated       Principal Investigator:    Steven Strauss       Affiliation:                       Colorado State University                               This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification        Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations        Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The principal        investigator is Dr. Steven Strauss from Colorado State University. The        research will develop a series of redox-active metal-complex        extractants to  extract target ions from aqueous waste streams. The        novelty of the research is the fact that the proposed technology may        lead to extractants that are recyclable, with contaminant recovery in        concentrated form, thereby minimizing disposal volumes. The        extractants are ferrocenes and the target ions are typically ionic        species.   The closed cycle scheme proposed involves recognition and        linking of the contaminant  ions to the  ferrocene extractant, removal        of the ionic species,  and reactivation of the ferrocene. The        extraction selectivity can be modified through chemical modifications        of the ferrocenes, and the PI proposes to study a class of polydentate        ferrocenes where the ligands can be chemically modified by design to        target specific ions.                 The development of molecular recognition compounds is of tremendous        importance to separation and extraction processes associated with        environmental technologies. The development of rugged, recylable        extractants wi th molecular recognition characteristics can have a        major impact on separations technology and pollution prevention.",
