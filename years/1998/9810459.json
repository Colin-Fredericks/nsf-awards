 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Phase I Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project aims to develop a simple, compact, easy-to-use microbial detection system consisting of application specific sample preparation kits, selective enrichment broths, and fiber optic biosensor instrumentation for real time detection and identification of the targeted pathogens in food.  With this integrated microbial detection system, the initial biosensor result (5 to 10 min) would identify the presence of the pathogen.  Subsequent selective culture (0.5 to 3 hrs) and a post-culture assay measurement would determine pathogen viability.  Foods such as beef, poultry, and seafood harbor a wide variety of microorganisms derived from the animal itself, the environment, and equipment/human contact during processing.  Some of these microbes are pathogens and can be potentially deadly to humans.  These microbial pathogens include E. coli 0157:H7 in beef, Salmonella in poultry, and Vibrio vulnificus in shellfish.  Recent food-borne outbreaks by these and other microbes underscore the importance of food safety and the critical need for rapid and accurate tests to identify food-borne pathogens.       The system can be utilized for pathogen detection in the food, food processing, water quality, and pharmaceutical quality control industries.  It may also be used for the detection of terrorist-released biowarfare weapons in public facilities such as subways and arenas.",
