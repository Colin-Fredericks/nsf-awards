The principal investigator is Dr. Yi Hua Ma at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The conference is the Fifth International Conference on Inorganic Membranes, Nagoya, Japan, June 22-26, 1998. A This is a topical area fully relevant to the Interfacial, Transport and Separation Processes Program. The objective of the   conference is to bring together international researchers and  industrial practitioners to present and   discuss their results on inorganic membranes, which is a   relatively new technology for high temperature separations. The conference will provide and for the U.S. participants to gain an understanding of the inorganic membrane activities relating to separations technology in the Pacific Rim. ~        The conference will cover both theoretical and experimental aspects of inorganic membranes with topics encompassing membrane preparation, membrane transport phenomena, characterization, membrane reactors and process systems. The conference will include plenary  lectures, and oral and poster   presentations.      ~ '          it",
