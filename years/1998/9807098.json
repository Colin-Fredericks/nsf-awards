 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor William H. Fenical, of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography,   Geochemistry, and Marine Chemistry at the University of California at San   Diego, is supported by the Organic Synthesis Program for his studies of   chemical defense in marine organisms.  Professor Fenical explores the   chemical ecology of marine plants and animals in order to expand our   knowledge of the sources, types, and reactivities of molecules produced   by marine organisms and to explore the natural functions of these   molecules in interspecies interactions within marine habitats.  Following   isolation and structure determination of new bioactive natural products   from ascidians, gorgonians, bryozoans, and other marine organisms, the   regioselective reactivities and skeletal interrelationships of selected   secondary metabolites are explored.  This project, emphasizing   ecologically relevant testing of pure substances using natural predators,   seeks to explore the chemical behaviors of new classes of natural   products from marine organisms, to establish the specific roles these   compounds play in interspecies interactions, and to define the influence   of these organic molecules on the biological composition of tropical   marine environments.  Marine organisms, both plant and animal, produce an astounding array of   organic compounds.  With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program,   Professor William H. Fenical, of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography,   Geochemistry, and Marine Chemistry at the University of California at San   Diego, explores the chemical means by which marine organisms effect their   defense.  Through isolation, structure determination, and testing of   molecules produced by various classes of marine organisms.  Professor   Fenical establishes the nature of the organic molecules used for chemical   defense and the influence of these organic molecules on the biological   composition of tropical marine environments.  In addition, these   fundamental studies of marine chemical defense are resulting in the   isolation of compounds of potential biomedical and commercial   significance, including antiflammatory agents.",
