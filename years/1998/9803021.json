 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803021  Browning    This project will study the structure/property relationships in  order to determine the optimum microstructure for the  incorporation of high-TC superconductors into viable devices.  The electronic conduction of these materials is extremely  sensitive to atomic-scale defects that are introduced during the  processing of the oxide material.  The relationship between the  atomic-scale defects and the electronic conduction can be  determined by atomic resolution Z-contrast imaging and electron  energy loss spectroscopy in the scanning transmission electron  microscope (STEM).  These techniques can be performed  simultaneously in the STEM, with the image being used to  determine the atomic structure and the spectrum being used to  determine the electronic structure.  Features of the spectrum can  be correlated with the charge carrier concentration, allowing  weak-links to be quantified on a scale below the coherence  length.  The atomic resolution analysis techniques will be  applied to two systems that are currently being developed for  power transmission and high-magnetic field applications.  In  collaboration with American Superconductor Corporation, a major  thrust of the proposal is to investigate the properties of  defects in Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu308 (2223) tapes and relate them to  processing conditions.  Building on an established successful  collaborative program, this project will investigate the  distribution of defects within the tapes and the relationship  between the formation of the 2223 phase and the tape  microstructure.  The second goal of this proposal is to  investigate the properties of YBa2Cu307 films produced on  textured metal substrates.  Although further from a viable  product, this recently developed fabrication procedure offers a  possible alternative to the 2223 tapes.  Research will focus on a  comparison of properties with the results from individual grain  boundaries and single crystals, with the aim of determining the  route to large-scale fabrication of t hese materials.  %%%  Since the discovery of high-TC superconductivity in the ceramic  oxides, these materials have held the promise of efficient,  powerful and sensitive electronic devices and power transmission  wires.  The results of this research will help determine the  processing route to produce improved tapes suitable for  commercial applications. The research will have a significant  impact on the applications of high-TC superconductors.  ***",
