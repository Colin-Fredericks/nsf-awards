 "awd_abstract_narration": "Britt Thomas of the University of Wyoming is supported by the   Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to investigate phospholipid   tubule self-assembly and phospholipid membrane-protein interactions using   X-ray scattering techniques.  The self-assembly studies will explore the   roles played by molecular tilt, twist, conformation, and chirality in   tubule formation.  A comparative study of various genetically-engineered,   membrane-bound proteins will extend the X-ray diffraction techniques used   to elucidate characteristics of these more complex systems.  The   education plan of this CAREER award involves the creation of an   interdisciplinary teaching program, in which two complementary upper   level courses are developed and added to the Chemistry and Molecular   Biology Department curricula.  The hallmark of nearly all technologically useful biomaterials is the   self-assembly of highly-ordered supramolecular structures from simpler   components.  Phospholipid membrane structures serve as the stage upon   which some of the most important processes of life occur, including many   catalytic reactions, protein production and folding, and photosynthesis.    Results from this study will be used to improve the understanding of   lipid membrane properties, and could subsequently impact the   technological development of membrane-based optical switches, molecular   electronics, molecular sieves, and chemical/biological sensors.  The   educational component of this award will encourage collaboration among   students and faculty in two separate academic departments at the   University of Wyoming, by enhancing cross-disciplinary teaching and   research efforts.",
