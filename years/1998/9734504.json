 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  research examines telepresence, \"the sense of being present  at  a  remote site,\" which has been identified as a design  ideal  for  teleoperators and virtual environments.  It is  intended  to  resolve extant confusion as to the origins of telepresence and to  develop a plausible and parsimonious telepresence model.  This is  to  be  accomplished by empirical investigations of teleoperation  system  and  human  factor  effects  on  subjective  measures  of  telepresence  along with studies of physiological  variables  and  mental  constructs, including attention and situation  awareness,  for objectively representing telepresence.  The research involves  developing  a descriptive model of telepresence in attention  for  understanding  the  phenomenon  and  predicting  its  effect   on  teleoperation  performance.   Design  guidelines  for   synthetic  environment configuration are also to be formulated based on  the  model.   The  effort  is  expected to  serve  as  a  vehicle  for  promoting  the  effective transport of human  perceptuo-cognitive  capabilities into remote environments through unique teleoperator  applications, such as the exploration of Mars, by encouraging  in  operators a sense of being at the remote site.  Outcomes  of  the  work  are  anticipated to be applicable to design of the spectrum  of  teleoperators and virtual environments and will be integrated  in  graduate student education in cognitive engineering  for  the  21st Century.",
