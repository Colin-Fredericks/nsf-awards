 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731013  Hahn    This award supports the participation of thirteen U.S.  researchers in the \"1998 U.S.-Korea Seminar on Composites,\"  to be held in Seoul, Korea, September 7-11, 1998.  The U.S.  and Korean Coordinators are, respectively, Dr. H. Thomas  Hahn, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department,  University of California, Los Angeles, and Dr. Chul Rim  Choe, Polymer Hybrids Research Center, Korea Institute of  Science and Technology, Seoul.  This seminar will bring  together leading scientists/engineers to discuss and  exchange information in this area of research and to  identify topics which may be suitably addressed in future  cooperative activities.    As a result of extensive research efforts over the past  three decades, a variety of composites have become  available which can provide the kind of unique performance  that conventional materials cannot.  Unfortunately,  however, such unique performance is frequently obtained at  a high cost, hindering wider application of these  materials. Nevertheless, cost can be brought down by using  an integrated approach to the development and production of  composite products.  The necessary integration requires  collaboration of engineers from diverse areas of composites  science and technology.  Thus, the main purpose of the  proposed joint seminar is to provide a forum for  researchers/educators from widely different backgrounds to  exchange information and explore the possibility of future  cooperation between the U.S. and Korea to realize mutual  benefits from the technology of composites.  This project  is relevant to the objectives of  the U.S.-Korea  Cooperative Science Program which seeks to increase the  level of cooperation between U.S. and Korean scientists and  engineers through the exchange of scientific information,  ideas, skills, and techniques and through collaboration on  problems of mutual benefit.  This project will provide  international training and experience for one U.S. graduate  student in an important area of res earch.  Korean  participation is supported by the Korea Science and  Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  The Korean Society for  Composite Materials (KSCM) will serve as host.  ***",
