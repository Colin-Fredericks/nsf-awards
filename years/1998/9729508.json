The workshop will identify policy and legal aspects of such regimes and asess their importance for science and technology; identify and analyze benefits that might accrue to science and technology from these regimes and issues that might impact science and technology negatively as a result of such regimes; and develop conclusions and recommendations that might assist in addressing these issues.  The workshop is expected to include presentations on the key issues; panel and general discussions; and development of conclusions and recommendations.  The workshop is expected to result in a report to sponsors and to the research community.",
