 "awd_abstract_narration": "9816616  Trivelpiece  Long-term seabird research conducted at Admiralty Bay, which  is located on King George Island in the Antarctic Peninsula  region, has documented annual variability in the life  history parameters of the breeding biology and ecology of  the Adelie, gentoo and chinstrap penguins.  Twenty-year  records acquired on these species, including survival and  recruitment, population size and breeding success, and diets  and foraging ecology have enabled scientists to test key  hypotheses regarding the linkage between these predator  parameters and variability in the Antarctic marine  ecosystem.  This project will focus on understanding the  linkages between the physical environment and the population  biology of penguins, in particular, sea ice coverage and its  impact on krill availability as a food source for penguins.  Krill is a key food web species in the Antarctic oceans and  accounts for nearly one hundred percent of the prey eaten by  dominant predators such as baleen whales, seals and  penguins.  Analysis of long-term data sets has suggested  that years of heavy winter sea ice favor krill recruitment,  as larval krill find refuge and food in the sea ice habitat.  It has also been observed that years of heavy sea ice favor  Adelie penguin recruitment and not that of chinstrap  penguins.  Aspects of the work include analysis of diet  samples, shipboard krill sampling, survival and recruitment  studies of penguins, satellite tracking of penguins during  the breeding season, and analysis of satellite sea ice  images.  Penguins are the key species used to monitor the  impact of commercial fisheries activities in the region, so  this study will provide useful information to the Convention  for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources,  which is the part of the Antarctic Treaty System which  focuses on fisheries management.",
