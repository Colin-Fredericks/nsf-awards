 "awd_abstract_narration": "9734804  Reddi    This award provides funds to permit Dr. Lakshmi Reddi,  Department of Civil Engineering, Kansas State University,  to pursue with Professor In-Mo Lee, Department of Civil  Engineering, Korea University, for 36 months, a program of  cooperative research on the impact of particle transport in  soils on filter performance.  The present collaboration  will add an international cooperative dimension to Dr.  Reddi's research presently funded under NSF Grant No. CMS-  9713708.  This research addresses problems arising from the  fact that a number of soil structures need filters for  protection against erosion and piping which can damage  adjacent structures, and the fact that damage may result if  these filters become clogged.  The domestic (CMS) project  involves fundamental studies on physicochemical and  biological mechanisms of filter clogging.  A complementary  study being undertaken by the team at Korea University  focuses on particle mobilization in residual soils (and  filter clogging associated with this mobilization) and  field investigations on failed filters.    The broad objective of the cooperative research effort is  to link up the U.S. and Korean domestic studies in order to  achieve a comprehensive and complete understanding of the  filter clogging mechanisms.  Specific objectives are: (1)  to exchange the experimental data on particle mobilization  from base soils and particle entrapment in filters; (2) to  share the data on field investigations; and (3) to  generalize and validate the filter design criteria in the  US domestic research project in light of field  investigations made in Korea.  Mutual benefit from the  collaboration is expected because results from the Korean  research will aid in validation of the theoretical and  laboratory investigations being undertaken in the United  States.  At the same time, both teams will benefit from the  theoretical treatment of data collected by the Korean team.  Thus, the collaboration will provide a unique opportunity  t o integrate two different perspectives of the problem,  one, a fundamental laboratory scale study, and the other, a  field-scale and practical study.  This project is relevant  to the objectives of  the U.S.-Korea Cooperative Science  Program which seeks to increase the level of cooperation  between U.S. and Korean scientists and engineers through  the exchange of scientific information, ideas, skills, and  techniques and through collaboration on problems of mutual  benefit.  This project will provide international training  and experience for a U.S. graduate student in an important  area of research.  Korean participation is supported by the  Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (KOSEF).  ***",
