 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports US-France cooperative research among Joseph Kearney   and James Kremer at the University of Iowa and Stephane Donikian at the Institute for   Research in Informatics and Random Systems (IRISA) in Rennes, France.  IRISA is   affiliated with INRIA, which is the French National Institute for Research in Informatics   and Applied Mathematics.  The objective of the research is to investigate scene and   scenario modeling for simulating large-scale virtual driving environments.  These   computer simulations are useful for studying driving behavior and conducting experiments   on the influence of drugs and disease, the effectiveness of computer-assisted driving aids,   and the impact of new in-vehicle technology.  The University of Iowa and IRISA groups   have developed independently driving simulators for rural and urban environments.  Their   work is supported by US and French governments respectively and Ford (in US) and   Renault (in France).  They have extensive and complementary expertise in system building,   dynamic simulation and control programming.  The project will advance knowledge of   virtual prototyping and the development of computer tools for understanding crashes and    crash prevention.",
