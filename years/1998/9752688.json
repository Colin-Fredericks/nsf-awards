 "awd_abstract_narration": "As technology diffuses through local government agencies and industries, the need for trained Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technicians and analysts continues to expand, as does the need for individuals in other fields to become aware of GIS and how it applies to their workplace.    This project, developed jointly by Erie Community College (N.Y.) and the State University of New York at Buffalo's Geography Department, addresses this need using a two-pronged approach. First, the GIS Curriculum Development Project will create a GIS Certificate Program for students to complete as part of their two-year degree program, or as a stand alone certificate. The project will develop a core of three (3) GIS-specific courses and a three (3) credit hour internship to provide students with a field experience component in their GIS Studies.    Secondly, this project will establish a GIS Infusion Program to train faculty in a variety of curricula to use GIS in their own courses within specific modules or applications. This will allow ECC students to develop experience and awareness of GIS and to learn how GIS technology relates to their own field of study. The GIS Infusion program will also develop a process for supplying GIS output directly to faculty for use in their classroom. This will allow GIS technology to reach a broader audience.      Two leading GIS educational institutions, the State University of New York at Buffalo and the University of California at Santa Barbara have agreed to lend their expertise in GIS technology, GIS curriculum development and faculty training to this project. The National Center for Geographic Information and Analysis (NCGIA) at the University of Buffalo will be also serve as project site for ECC students enrolled in the newly created GIS courses.",
