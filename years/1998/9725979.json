 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725979  Cava    The discovery of high temperature superconductivity in complex  copper oxides led to the widespread realization that the  relationships between the chemistry, crystal structure, and  electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal oxides was  understood at only a cursory level. Due to the presence of strong  interactions between the d electrons, and the interactions  between the electrons, magnetic spins, and the underlying atomic  lattice, the usual band structure based picture (which, for  example, does not include the effects of electronelectron  correlations) often can not properly describe the observed  electronic and magnetic properties. This research program in  solid state chemistry has the goal of discovering new complex  oxides with exotic electronic and magnetic properties due to  their proximity to insulator-metal transitions. Two classes of  chemical compounds are considered in detail. The research program  consists of: (1) The discovery and characterization of new  ternary and quaternary ruthenium oxides, oxyhalides, and related  compounds. Taken as a whole, previous studies strongly suggest  that ruthenium and oxygen represent one of the pairs of atoms in  the periodic table for which unusual physical properties result  due to the characteristics of the metal-oxygen bond and the types  of crystal structures which occur when compounds with ternary  elements are formed. (2) The discovery of new copper oxide  superconductors and related materials with low-dimensional copper-  oxygen arrays. This program searches for new copper based oxides  synthesized at high oxygen pressures, in which the copper-oxygen  plane does not have the usual Cu02 checkerboard geometry. New  materials are sought in which the CuO geometry is electronically  \"simpler\" than the Cu02 plane. The characterization of these  materials will allow direct comparison to the predictions of  models for the behavior of quantum mechanical spin systems, an  area of intense theoretical activity, whic h many believe may hold  the key to the microscopic mechanism of high temperature  superconductivity .  %%%  Many of today's technological systems are based on the use of  sophisticated electronic materials. As those systems increase in  complexity, the types of materials they are based on also  increase in complexity. This project uses the methods of solid  state chemistry in the search for new materials at the borders of  our understanding of the fundamental relationships between the  chemistry, crystalline structure, and electronic and magnetic  properties of solids. Two promising classes of transition metal  oxides will be studied, with the hope that the insight gained  will ultimately help define the future directions of both  condensed matter science and electronics technology.  ***",
