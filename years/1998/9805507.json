 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reiter  9805507    Chaos and Crystallographic Symmetry    Recent investigations have led to illustrations of attractors arising  from the iteration of functions that are measurably chaotic but  nonetheless have specified nontrivial symmetry.  This requires  determination of classes of functions with suitable equivariance  properties along with searches for parameters yielding nontrivial  behavior and visualization techniques suited to the attractor.  This  investigation is designed to advance that work to the crystallographic  space groups.  The classes of equivariant functions need to be  identified, nontrivial parameters located and the attractors  visualized.  It is expected that viewing parameters can be changed in  real time at low resolution and fixed images and animations routinely  created at high resolution.  This task is challenging and interesting  because of the mathematical complexity of the 230 crystallographic space  groups and the difficulties in rendering attractors in three dimensions  in a manner in which the symmetries are apparent.  It is expected that  this work will allow viewers to experience the features of these  symmetry groups in new ways.    The general focus of this project is to find and visualize certain  complex mathematical objects in three dimensions using a high  performance workstation; the particular objects are chaotic attractors  with crystallographic symmetry.  These mathematical objects have an  underlying chaotic structure while at the same time exhibiting a high  degree of symmetry.  The symmetries which will be considered are those  associated with crystals; these symmetries have been of great interest  to chemists for that reason.  Similar two dimensional objects have been  the subject of considerable recent study by mathematicians and this  project is designed to extend our understanding of objects of this type  to three dimensions.  A graphics workstation with massive memory will be  used to create high quality images of these complex objects.  Sin ce  these complex objects are the result of literally millions or billions  of data points, creating insightful, meaningful visual representations  of the data is essential to understanding them.  The high level  visualization techniques and the resulting insights into the three  dimensional symmetries of these objects should be of interest to  mathematicians and others, like chemists, who can benefit from  understanding these symmetry groups.  The project is designed to fully  involve several undergraduate students in the research and hence these  students will not only gain valuable experience with using this high  performance workstation but they should also be among the first to view  these symmetry groups in the new ways resulting from this research  project.",
