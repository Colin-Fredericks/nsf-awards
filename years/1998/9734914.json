 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9734914  Tu  High speed machining is a technology that has the potential of drastically reducing machining time, improving product accuracy and surface finish, and eliminating some finishing processes. One of the major problems in high-speed machining is the development of spindles with sufficient reliability to afford the high machining speed. The objective of this GOALI project is to develop a high-performance spindle prototype which is inherently reliable with high forgiveness for production error, and to study issues related to its implementation to high-speed, high-reliability processes.  The research tasks include: 1) Development of an electro-thermo-mechanical model of an entire motorized spindle system for design sensitivity analysis, 2) Development of an inherently reliable spindle prototype using the model and new designs, and 3) Development of a Multiple-sensor based spindle/process monitor. The project will be performed jointly by Purdue University and Cincinnati Milacron Inc.  The project is expected to have significant impact on the design of next-generation, high-performance machine tools.  The knowledge of spindle dynamics, thermal behavior, and process factors critical to spindle reliability obtained from the project could reduce the cost of lost production, spindle inventories, and spindle rehabilitation due to unexpected premature failures.",
