 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will investigate, design and deploy a suite of novel\r\nmulticast protocols aimed primarily at ad hoc networks.  The investigators\r\nmaintain that, due to the inherent broadcast capability, wireless networks\r\nare well suited for multicast communication.  The contributions of the\r\nproposed suite of multicast packet routing and forwarding protocols (IMAHN)\r\ncan be summarized as follows: (1) design, evaluation, prototyping and\r\ndeployment of a suite of multicast routing and packet forwarding protocols\r\nfor ad hoc networks, and (2)  development of an integrated multicast\r\nrouting solution for the mixed-media internetwork of the future; this\r\nincludes investigation, evaluation, prototyping, and deployment of\r\nmechanisms providing seamless multicast service.\r\n\r\nIMAHN will emphasize the following: (1) robustness vs efficiency: many\r\nexisting multicast routing approaches rely on state in routers to keep\r\ntrack of multicast group members. This, coupled with the high volume of\r\nrouting information exchanges and slow convergence, makes traditional\r\nmulticast approaches untenable in highly dynamic ad hoc networks (AHNs)\r\ncomposed of anemic (low-power, low storage capacity) hosts. We propose a\r\nnew technique, adaptive flooding, that stresses rapid and robust delivery.\r\nIMAHN will consist of a suite of adaptive protocols addressing a range of\r\nAHNs and mobility patterns. In constantly changing AHNs, redundant\r\nbroadcasting may be appropriate, while, in less dynamic AHNs, a range of\r\nmore bandwidth-efficient multicast protocols will be considered; (2)\r\nadaptability: hosts should be able to (and will) migrate freely among ad\r\nhoc, fixed-infrastructure mobile, and traditional wired networks.  In order\r\nto function appropriately -- when faced with changes in the underlying\r\ninfrastructure -- hosts need switch on-the-fly among multiple multicast\r\nmechanisms; (3) unlimited mobility: some existing solutions are geared\r\ntowards discrete mobility where periods of movement are interspersed with\r\nperiods of rest. Others assume certain limits on direction, speed and\r\nnumber of simultaneously moving hosts. In contrast, we stress universal,\r\nunlimited mobility of all network components; (4) integrated multicast:\r\nmulticast solutions for AHNs will most likely differ substantially from\r\nthose for fixed networks (one of the main reasons is the marked difference\r\nin transmission rates). In order to offer seamless and integrated multicast\r\nservice for the mixed-media internetwork of the future, IMAHN will develop\r\nnovel mechanisms for inter-operation of fixed and wireless multicast\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\n",
