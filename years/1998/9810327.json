 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN(MCB)-981027  Beverly C. Delidow, P.I.      The goal of this proposal is to examine the regulation of a  pituitary hormone gene,  prolactin, by cell-cell contacts. Preliminary data show that  prolactin (PRL) gene  expression increases when rat 235-1 pituitary tumor cells  experience  greater levels  of cell-cell adhesion. In contrast, PRL levels decrease when  the cells are exposed  to glucocorticoids, which decrease both the levels of cell-  cell adhesion molecules  and cell reaggregation. The cell adhesion molecules involved  are the cadherin-catenin system of calcium-dependent cell  adhesion proteins.  These proteins participate in both  forming stable cell-cell contacts and in intracellular  signaling. Prolactin levels decrease profoundly in cells in  which the DF-catenin levels have been decreased by exposure  to antisense oligo-nucleotides. These observations led to  the hypothesis that cell-cell contacts mediated by cadherins  serve a regulatory function in PRL gene expression. In  completion of  the proposed work, the hypothesis will be  tested in the following ways: 1. The data strongly imply  that 235-1 cells contain cadherin-like proteins, but their  identity is not  known. The identification of these molecules is essential  because the cell surface  cadherin interacts with a like molecule on a neighboring  cell to initiate stable cell-cell adhesions. It is also  necessary characterize the cadherin(s ) expressed so that  their function may be perturbed specifically. Both RNA and  protein analyses will be carried out using existing cadherin  probes or antibodies to determine which cadherin-related  genes are expressed in 235-1 cells. 2. To determine the role  of cadherin proteins in PRL gene regulation, the Tet-on  system, a new means of stably introducing inducible genes  into mammalian cells, will be used to generate sublines of  235-1 cells that contain an inducible gene for the  inhibitory fragment of cadherin. When the cadherin fragment  gene is induced, the cells shoul d lose  cell-cell adhesion,  allowing a detailed investigation of effect of that loss on  PRL gene expression. 3. Finally, glucocorticoid treatment of  235-1 cells leads to a  decrease in the expression of catenins; the mechanism of  this decrease will be examined. Catenins are regulated at  multiple levels in other cells. The potential targets for  regulation are RNA levels, protein levels and protein  modification. All of these possibilities will be examined.  The information gained from these studies will add to the  growing evidence for a regulatory role of cell-cell adhesion  molecules in differentiated cell types. In addition, novel  data will be generated on the regulation of lactotrophs,  versatile endocrine cells with roles in reproduction,  osmoregulation and behavior across many vertebrate species.",
