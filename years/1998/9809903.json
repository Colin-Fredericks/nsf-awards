 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award is for the support of collaborative research between Dr. Hitay Ozbay, Professor of Electrical Engineering at Ohio State University in Columbus, and Dr. Altug Iftar, Professor of Electrical Engineering at Anadolu University in Eskisehir, Turkey.  The scientists plan to study the development of dynamic routing and flow algorithms for high-speed data-communication networks.  A team of researchers from Turkey will investigate specific routing problems, and the US team will concentrate on flow control issues.  For flow control, specific robust control techniques will be developed for a generic mathematical model, which is a varying time delay system.  The routing controller will be designed with the aim of minimizing total delay and queue length, and maximizing the throughput in the network.  The ultimate goal of this collaboration is to integrate routing and flow control under one design paradigm.  Scope:  This project involves two scientists with complementary qualifications.  They will work on different aspects of a complex scientific problem to obtain integrated algorithms for high speed data-communication networks.  They will study the implementation of these algorithms in several important applications.  The two scientists have already established a working relationship, so that this collaborative project should proceed smoothly and successfully.  The Turkish scientist works at a relatively smally university in Turkey, and this project will help establigh its linkages to researchers in the United States.  The project fits well within the objectives of the Division of International Programs.",
