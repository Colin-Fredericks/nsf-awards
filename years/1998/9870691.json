 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award will support the establishment of a multidisciplinary graduate training program in integrated chemical sensor design.  This activity is a joint effort of nine faculty from the Departments of Chemistry, Chemical and Materials Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. This group of scientists and engineers has established research collaborations and their collective expertise will provide the intellectual underpinning for the training of seventy-five graduate students over the five-year duration of the award.  Students will have multiple mentors in this cross-disciplinary research setting and their graduate training will include multidisciplinary courses, workshops, and seminars; problem-based learning; and internships in industrial and government laboratories.  Areas of research focus include molecular recognition, polymer design, genetic engineering, organized protein assemblies, new transduction principles, micromachining, integrated chemical sensor electronics, and signal processing.  IGERT students will be recruited nationwide with emphasis placed on identifying and recruiting qualified individuals from underrepresented groups in science and engineering.  IGERT is a new, NSF-wide program intended to facilitate the establishment of innovative, research-based graduate programs that will train a diverse group of scientists and engineers to be well-prepared to take advantage of a broad spectrum of career options.  IGERT provides doctoral institutions with an opportunity to develop new, well-focussed multidisciplinary graduate programs that transcend organizational boundaries and unite faculty from several departments or institutions to establish a highly interactive, collaborative environment for both training and research.  In this first year of the program, support will be provided to seventeen institutions for new or nascent programs that collectively span all areas of science and engineering supported by NSF.",
