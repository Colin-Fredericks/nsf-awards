 "awd_abstract_narration": "The somatic sensory system carries information on touch,  temperature and pain to the brain.  Nerve cells innervating the  skin called 'first-order' neurons send signals to the spinal cord  segments, where they make functional connections called synapses  to neurons that carry information up and down the spinal column.  Biochemical compounds called neurotransmitters are released by the  first-order cells to activate or inhibit these target 'second-  order' cells, and an important class of these signaling molecules  is known as peptides.  This project addresses the role of the  peptides enkephalin, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and calcitonin-gene  related peptide (CGRP) in this neurotransmission.  Particular  genes or anti-sense constructs will be delivered by a novel  methodology utilizing modified viruses, to increase or decrease  the production of these peptides in the first-order sensory  neurons.  Molecular analysis of gene expression, a behavioral  assay for sensation, and pharmacological manipulation will  determine how the peptides act, and what receptor molecules on the  cell surface membranes are responsible for their action.  Results  are expected to clarify how enkephalins and NPY inhibit sensory  transmission, while CGRP facilitates it.     This project will have impact beyond simply somatosensory  transmission, because it will clarify mechanisms of action for  particular neurotransmitters used in other parts of the brain, and  the gene-delivery methods to be perfected here will provide a  powerful tool to study the roles of other molecular components in  neuronal function.",
