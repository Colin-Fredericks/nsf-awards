 "awd_abstract_narration": "The St. Croix Watershed Research Station (SCWRS) is the biological  field station of the Science Museum of Minnesota (SMM). The  facilities of the SCWRS are located along the St. Croix River and  within the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway at the boundary  between Minnesota and Wisconsin, 48 km northeast of St. Paul, MN.  The SCWRS provides opportunities to conduct research on a large  midcontinental river system and associated habitats. Through its  parent facility, the SCWRS provides a powerful public education  outlet for field science.    The  SCWRS  was established in 1989 and has greatly  expanded  its  physical facilities, staffing,  and  research activity in the intervening nine years.  An  initial  strategic  planning  effort was conducted in 1992.  The  resulting  plan  guided  the development of a modern 6200 ft Research  Center  and  a  year-round housing facility for visiting scientists,  both  completed  in 1995. The SCWRS has expanded its permanent  staffing  complement  from three to nine positions, including five  research  positions.  The  scientific staff were specifically  recruited  to  create   a  core  research  program  focusing  on  landscape-level  problems  in  land-water interaction. The current  research  staff  have   expertise  and  training  in  aquatic  biology,  limnology,  hydrology, soil science, chemistry, and GIS management. This  base  of  scientific expertise complements a visiting researcher program  that focuses on ecology and biology.    The SCWRS has entered a phase of accelerated program growth, which  will increase its ability to make significant contributions to  national and international field research. The original facilities  and research plan is over five years old, and a new vision is  needed to carry the SCWRS into the future. Planned program  initiatives coupled with facilities changes and equipment  procurement will be needed if SCWRS is to meet its full potential  as a regional and national field faci lity. The SCWRS has now  reached a critical point of accelerated development that will set  the future of long-term use and development at the site.    This project will support a planning effort that will set a new  SCWRS research and facilities trajectory for the future. Funds  would be used to support the development and implementation of a  facilitated planning workshop. The final product will be a new  research and facilities plan that will guide facilities  development, sting, and research of the SCWRS for the next ten  years and provide a long-range vision for research and program  development.",
