 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806000  Sharma  This research addresses the thermodynamics, kinetics, reaction  path, structure and composition of intermediate phases, atomic  level structural mechanism of the reaction of Zr containing  compounds with N2 and NH3. In situ x-ray diffraction studies will  be conducted at the University of Tubingen, and transmission  electron microscopy at Arizona State University. The approach is  to synthesize zirconia phase(s) with randomly ordered oxygen  vacancies by anion (N for O) substitution. Most of the studies of  zirconia stabilization are concentrated on cation substitution,  preferably by a lower valent ion such Y or Ca, to create randomly  ordered oxygen vacancies. Some zirconium oxynitride with ordered  oxygen vacancies in the lattice have been synthesized, but  randomly ordered vacancies are required for a material to be used  in solid oxide fuel cells. The present project is directed  towards a preliminary study that will lead to a detailed  systematic investigation of the Zr-O-N system. Various Zr  containing compounds such as ZrO2, Zr(SO4)2, Zr(OH)4,  Zr(NO3)4.6H20, ZrOCl2 and (NH4)3ZrF7 will be heated in a N2 or  NH3 atmosphere, and time, temperature resolved x-ray diffraction,  electron diffraction, high resolution electron microscopy and  electron energy loss spectroscopy will be used to elucidate the  reaction path and identify all phases.  %%%  This is a research enhancement grant made under the Professional  Opportunities for Women in Research and Education (POWRE)  program. The research will contribute new materials science  knowledge at a fundamental level. Progress in understanding the  reaction path is expected to advance the potential to synthesize  technological important materials by design.",
