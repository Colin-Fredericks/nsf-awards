The  original  consolidation  theory for fine-grained soils cannot  predict  the   influence  of  creep  deformations  that  occur  under  constant   effective  stress  levels.   This  has   led   to  significant  practical  problems,  including  difficulty  in  predicting   field   consolidation  settlements   based   on  laboratory tests.  It has also led to research and debate on  the  nature  of creep during consolidation.  One  hypothesis  predicts no influence of creep deformations until after  all  loading-induced  pore water pressures  are  dissipated;  the  other hypothesis includes creep throughout the consolidation  process.    There   are   substantial  data  and  prominent  researchers  supporting  each  of the two theories, but little  agreement  between them.    This   research   will  investigate  the   validity   of   a  consolidation  model  that  can potentially  unify  the  two  hypotheses and explain both sets of  apparently conflicting data.  This research is not aimed  at  proving  one  of  the hypotheses, but toward  measuring  the  contribution  of each consolidation component (due  to  pore  pressure  dissipation  and  due to  creep)  to  the  overall  behavior.    The  research will be executed through a partnership between  Northeastern University and the University of Massachusetts-  Amherst.   The  UMASS-  Amherst  partner  will  obtain  high  quality  block samples of four natural soils, each with  its  own  particular structure, and will perform short- and long-  term  conventional, incrementally loaded tests  to  evaluate  creep  behavior  and conventional consolidation  parameters.  At    Northeastern,    a    computer-automated,    specially  inst rumented consolidation cell was developed under a  prior  NSF  award.   This device will be used to perform controlled  gradient  tests with feedback provided by mid-specimen  pore  pressure probes.  ***",
