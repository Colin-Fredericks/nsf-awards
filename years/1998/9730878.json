The vent communities originated earlier  than the Silurian, at least 430 million years ago.  Because  of the largely local production of food, the organisms are  independent of surface produced organic carbon.  One genus,  the polychaete Alvinella, is found at modern vents and  apparently has been a member of this community since the  beginning.  The members of this genus are characterized by a  living habitat in close proximity to black smoker effulent  which is exposed to extremely high temperatures of up to 80  oC.  We propose to build a heated pressure retaining  container to collect live alvinellids and use these for  shipboard experiments in already existing pressure vessels.  We will test their temperature tolerance and verify  measurements made in situ.  This should provide access to  the apparently most heat tolerant animal known and allow us  to begin to investigate the mechanisms allowing this  phenomenon.  As a final goal, we will describe conditions  and metabolic responses which may have developed during the  early period on earth and may have been carried over in a  refuge from surface extinctions; the hydrothermal vent  community.",
