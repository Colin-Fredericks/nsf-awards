 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics Accessible to Visually Impaired Students (MAVIS)  is an access project dedicated to ensuring that communication  between mathematics faculty and their blind students is clear and  meaningful.  Two major problems exist when attempting to establish  this communication.  First, faculty cannot easily make their  mathematics and science instructional and assessment materials  accessible to these students.  Second, blind students cannot  independently communicate their course work with faculty in print,  and few teachers will be proficient in Braille codes.  The goal of  the proposed research is to give better access to visually impaired  students to the educational domains of science, engineering,  mathematics and technology.  The objectives of the MAVIS project  are to ensure:      o  that tools and channels are available to instructors       nationwide so that they may be able to give their students       quality materials at the same time as their sighted peers;     o  that tools are available to visually impaired students so they       can produce quality standard print technical documents for       their instructors;     o  that in-class electronic devices are accessible, and    o  that all of the above are not only usable, but also are       intuitive to learn.       MAVIS proposes to support and conduct research and development  projects in the following areas:  (1) LaTex to Nemeth code  translation filter; (2) Back-translation filter; (3) Math screen  readers and equation browsers, and (4) Testing and evaluation of an  accessible graphing calculator and other non-MAVIS access  technology.  MAVIS will also use its Braille and tactile image  production lab for science, mathematics, engineering,  and  technology (SMET) courses offered at New Mexico State University.",
