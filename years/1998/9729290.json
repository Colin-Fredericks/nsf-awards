In many of these applications the control system is so essential that the system simply cannot operate without it.  On the other hand, failure of the control system can have dire consequences.  Graphic examples include the Chernobyl disaster and Airbus crashes.\r\n\r\nIn recent years it has become clear that one of the principal challenges facing control reseaxchers is the need to transition theoretical advances to operational systems.  To address this challenge, I am proposing to expand my control laboratory by extending current experiments and by developing new experiments.  These experiments provide motivation for theoretical control concepts and help to transition control theory to practice.\r\n\r\nUnder prior NSF support we have developed five control experiments, namely, the acoustic duct experiment, the rotating actuator experiment, the rotating imbalance experiment, the control-moment gyro experiment, and the autonomous aircraft experiment.  Under the proposed program all of these experiments will be extended to increase their versatility and to provide additional challenges.  In addition, we propose to develop three additional experiments, namely, control of three-dimensional acoustic fields, electrostatic control of a membrane, and control of combustion.  These additional experiments provide a significant expansion of our prior experimental activities into new and more challenging applications of control.\r\n\r\nThe equipment to be purchased under this grant includes a high-speed real-time parallel processor along with supporting infrastructure which includes sensors, actuators, filters, amplifiers, and power supplies.  \r\n***  \r\n",
