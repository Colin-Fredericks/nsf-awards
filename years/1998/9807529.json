 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9807529  Kostelich    This project is an application of chaos theory from mathematics to electric power engineering.  The project focuses on the research on the design, formulation, and performance of electrical load models that employ chaos.  The objective is to design a load model for certain highly varying loads such as AC electric arc furnaces, steel rolling mills, plasma torches and certain other mining loads, and electric arc welders.  These loads have been shown to have load currents that are time series that exhibit chaos: that is, tests for chaos have been applied to field measurements and it appears that the load current data are consistent with a chaotic system as the generating source.  The principal investigators span two universities (Arizona State University and Iowa State University) and two departments (Electrical Engineering and Mathematics) with the plan to combine facilities, talents, and capabilities to study chaotic models for the cited application.  The research plan is to test chaotic models for applicability and accuracy with respect to field data and other models (namely, the stochastic model).  The method of comparison and evaluation is through the use of advanced power quality indices, measures from the mathematics of chaos, and time and frequency domain evaluations.  Actual AC arc furnace data shall be used in the evaluation and accuracy assessment.    This project builds on the work of the co-principals.  Some application oriented work was completed for the Electric Power Research Institute; however, that sponsor was primarily interested in applications and software development.  Virtually no theoretical work nor fundamental research was done. This project proposes the fundamental research on the use of chaos models for highly varying electrical loads.    The practical impacts of this work are: the utilization of chaos for a load model which may represent certain load types more accurately and more like the actual physical process; the development of accurate lo ad models for certain types of highly varying loads; and a new application of chaos theory for the measurement of the impact of highly varying electrical loads.  Also, there is an educational component to the project and there is expected to be an impact on the students, both graduate and undergraduate, who are involved in the project.  This will be in the understanding and utilization of chaos theory.  Part of the implementation of the educational component of the project is the development of a classroom study module on chaos.",
