 "awd_abstract_narration": "Musson, 98-01151    Abstract      This proposal will deal specifically with several problems concerning  primitive ideals in the enveloping algebra of a classical simple Lie  superalgebra.  The methods to be used include those developed by the PI  and results from representation theory.  In addition geometric methods   will be used to study the center of the enveloping algebra, and the  associated variety of a primitive ideal.  Differential operators on  invariant rings of tori are studied in a forthcoming joint memoir with  Michel van den Bergh, and we hope to extend some of this work to actions  of other reductive groups.  The PI also plans to study Hopf algebra duality  and cliques in quantum function algebras. He also plans to study  nonstandard quantum groups such as the Cremmer-Gervais examples.      There is motivation from Physics for this line of research since differential   operators which are invariant under various groups of symmetries are   important in quantum mechanics.  Finally, quantum groups have become  extremely important in recent years in both Mathematics and Physics.  Numerous connections have been found with such diverse areas as group  theory, low dimensional topology, combinatorics, number theory, conformal  field theory and statistical mechanics.",
