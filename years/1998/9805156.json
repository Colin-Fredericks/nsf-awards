Funds will be distributed by the two co-convenors of the conference, and it is their intent to support young scientists who can provide some of their own costs on a matching basis. The attendance of young scientists at this meeting is important because they bring new and innovative ideas to the science, and because they are responsible for future research in the field. Attendance at the conference will provide these young scientists with the opportunity to learn from established international leaders in fluid inclusion research, and to initiate collaborative projects with other researchers in academia, industry, and government agencies and laboratories.",
