The PI  in  previous   work  has  shown  that  in  Tl-2201   and   YBCO   the  redistribution of oxygen defects can alter Tc by as much as  40K.  The present project will make use of unique apparatus including a  pressure cell incorporating a SQUID detector, to measure the time  dependence  of  relaxational changes  in  transition  temperature  following application of hydrostatic pressure. The goals  of  the  project   are:  (a)  establish  in  which  oxides  and  at   what  stoichiometries important relaxation effects occur, and in  these  cases to measure the T and P dependences of the relaxation times;  (b) to determine through diffraction studies and NMR measurements  the nature of the defects involved; (c) through correction of the  measured   pressure  dependence  of  Tc  for   these   relaxation  processes,  to  determine at varying doping levels the  intrinsic  dependence of Tc on lattice parameter. This project also includes  high   pressure   magnetization  studies  on  several   fullerene  superconductors. The goal here is to clarify anomalous properties  which     include     pressure-induced     monomeric-to-polymeric  transitions,   orientational  ordering  effects,  and   covalency  effects    in    the   bonding.   This   research   program    is  interdisciplinary  in nature and involves one  or  more  graduate  students,  who  receive  excellent training  in  preparation  for  careers in industry, government laboratories or academia.  %%%  This experimental research project is concerned with the role  of  crystalline defects in setting the transition temperature of  two  interesting types of superconductor, the cuprates and fullerides.  The    cuprates   are   the   highest   transition    temperature  s uperconductors known, in some cases superconducting up to  160K.  The fullerides, also known as Buckminsterfullerenes, are recently  discovered  superconductors up to about  30K,  formed  by  adding  alkali metals such as Na or Rb to carbon-sixty molecules. The  PI  in  previous  work  has shown that in certain cuprate  cases  the  redistribution of oxygen defects can alter Tc by as much as  40K.  The present project will make use of unique apparatus including a  pressure cell incorporating a SQUID detector, to measure the time  dependence   of  changes  in  transition  temperature   following  application  of  hydrostatic pressure.  The  time  dependence  is  observed  in  some  cases  even at very low  temperatures,  which  strongly  indicates that crystalline defects  are  involved.  For  example, the oxygen in the cuprate can transfer from one location  to  another, following the application of a change in hydrostatic  pressure.  Two goals of the project are: (a) establish  in  which  oxides  and  at  what  compositions important relaxation  effects  occur, and in these cases to measure the temperature and pressure  dependences  of  the  relaxation times;  and,  (b)  to  determine  through  diffraction studies and NMR measurements the  nature  of  the   defects   involved.  These  studies   are   important   for  applications   of  cuprate  superconductors,  because   in   most  applications it is desirable to select compositions for which the  transition  temperature will be stable over  time.  This  project  also  includes  high  pressure magnetization studies  on  several  fullerene  superconductors. The goal here is to clarify anomalous  properties  which include pressure-induced monomeric-to-polymeric  transitions,   orientational  ordering  effects,  and   covalency  effects    in    the   bonding.   This   research   program    is  interdisciplinary  in nature and involves one  or  more  graduate  students,  who  receive  excellent training  in  preparation  for  careers in industry,  government laboratories or academia.  ***",
