 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the renormalization theory of critical circle mappings.  This theory has developed in parallel with the renormalization theory of unimodal maps, which has enjoyed spectacular progress since Sullivan's ground-breaking work in the late 1980's.  The work of Sullivan, McMullen, and Lyubich culminated in establishing the global hyperbolicity of the renormalization operator, thus providing the mathematical basis for the universality phenomena in unimodal dynamics.  Yampolsky will attempt to settle the corresponding Hyperbolicity Conjecture in the theory of circle maps, as well as investigate matings of quadratic polynomials with Siegel disks.   One of the reasons why fractal shapes are so eye catching is their self-similarity: when appropriately magnified, the fragments of the fractal resemble the whole. It often happens that iterations of this procedure, i.e. consecutive enlargements, converge to a certain  limiting ``universal'' shape. Such convergence of rescalings or ``renormalizations'' of  a complicated object is a fundamental principle of various physical theories, for example, with the dynamics of gases and fluids and in quantum mechanics. Particularly simple models for renormalization convergence exist in the framework of one-dimensional dynamics. For one such model, the Feigenbaum renormalization, the phenomenon of convergence has been established recently by rigorous mathematical methods. This convergence manifests itself through universal properties of the fractal Mandelbrot set and is also experimentally observed in hydrodynamics. Yampolsky will investigate this convergence in the other one-dimensional model, the renormalization of circle maps. This  problem, which was formulated in the late 1970's, has been the object of attention of various authors, and several beautiful mathematical theories were built to explain the empirically observed convergence of renormalization. Proving the convergence of renormalization in this context may contribute to a solid mathematica l foundation for the phenomenon of the convergence of renormalization in other problems of modern physical science.",
