 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the studies of   Professor Chrys Wesdemiotis on the synthesis of neutral, gas-phase   intermediates and their characterization by neutralization-reionization   mass spectroscopy.   Neutral intermediates, such as carbyne, silanone,   amino acid radicals and hypermetalated species, will be prepared from the   corresponding mass-selected cations or anions under conditions of   endothermic neutralization at low kinetic energy.    Ionization energies,   proton affinities and heats of formation of these neutral intermediates   will be extracted from the measured neutralization endothermicity.    The   different stabilities and reactivities of amino acids and peptides   neutralized by proton attachment will be exploited to distinguish proton   binding sites and their relative proton affinities in multi-functional   biomolecules.   Graduate and undergraduate students carrying out the   experiments will be exposed to the construction of the   neutralization-reionization mass spectrometer, its application to   different chemical systems, and the analysis of the resulting data.    With this New award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports the research and educational activities of Professor Chrys   Wesdemiotis of the University of Akron.   Professor Wesdemiotis will   focus his research on the synthesis and characterization of neutral   intermediates that are currently thought to be short-lived intermediates   in a number of chemical transformations.  A number of intermediates will   be prepared in the gas phase and examined under low-energy neutralization   conditions in order to obtain long-sought thermodynamic parameters.   The   educational activities of Professor Wesdemiotis will include the training   of undergraduate and graduate students in the theory and applications of   neutralization-reionization mass spectroscopy.",
