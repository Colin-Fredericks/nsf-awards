 "awd_abstract_narration": "9805900   HOSKINS      In the study funded by this POWRE award,  Dr. Hoskins will examine the molecular basis of changes that occur  in the frog eye during metamorphosis.  The eyes of young tadpoles  are situated on the sides of the head and the two eyes view non-  overlapping regions of the visual world.  During metamorphosis,  the head changes shape, and the eyes move together, with the  result that adult frogs have binocular vision -- parts of the  visual world are seen with both eyes, as is the case in humans.  During the transition from tadpole to frog, which is brought about  by thyroid hormone, numerous changes occur both within the eye and  in the connections between the eye and the brain.  Previous work  from the Hoskins laboratory showed that thyroid hormone induces a  specific new pattern of retinal growth, and that a new set of  optic nerve axons are produced during metamorphosis.  These new  studies will address the question of how thyroid hormone triggers  changes in retinal growth, and how the new axons formed during  metamorphosis are able to connect to their proper targets, which  differs from the pattern of connections made by tadpole axons.  Thyroid hormone acts through a receptor that is capable of  changing the pattern of gene expression; it therefore seems likely  that hormone-induced genes expressed in the retina will play a  role in the metamorphic transformations in the visual system.  The  nervous systems of all animals, including humans, are dependent on  thyroid hormone for proper development.  Dr. Hoskins' experimental  system offers a uniquely accessible and manipulable model for  examining the mechanisms of thyroid hormone action during  development, and the results of these studies are expected to be  relevant to its general roles in neuronal development.    This POWRE award will allow an excellent investigator with  substantial teaching duties to begin a research project using new  molecular methodology on a system and a question with in which she  has had a long -standing interest.",
