An ultrabroadband femtosecond terahertz (THz) probe  pulse (generated by optical rectification of a 50fs optical  pulse) will be used to spectrally time resolve the far-infrared  transient response of high-TC superconductors induced by an  optical pump pulse through the change in the reflectivity  produced by the perturbed complex conductivity. Since the  spectral extent of the linearly polarized THz probe pulse  includes the superconducting gap 2A, this technique will be used  to monitor directly the optically-induced perturbations to the  anisotropic order parameter A, the pseudogap in under-doped  materials, and transient inter- and intra-plane coupling between  Cu-O layers and chains using untwinned Yttrium- and Barium-based  cuprate crystals. In addition, to aid the understanding of the  time-resolved THz spectra, two-photon excited-state  angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy will be employed to  determine the relevant characteristics (lifetime and momentum) of  the optically-coupled unoccupied states above the Fermi level.  All measurements will be performed as a function of TITC to  elucidate temperature dependencies. The results from these  carefully designed ultrafast spectroscopic measurements should  have a great impact on our understanding of the unique properties  of high-TC superconductors in a manner parallel to that provided  by similar femtosecond optical techniques in semiconductor  physics. The educational component will involve both  undergraduate physics majors and students from Chicago area high  schools in research in the investigators laboratory that is  connected to the goals of the project.  %%%  This is a CAREER Award which uses sophisticated optical methods  to study high temperature superconductor s. The discovery in 1986  of copper-oxide-based ceramic materials, which exhibit zero  electrical resistance at liquid nitrogen (-3 F) (rather than  liquid helium (-450 F)) temperatures, has ignited technological  interest in superconductivity as a means of dramatically reducing  energy distribution costs, developing efficient high-speed  levitating transportation, and making ultrafast electronic  switches. However, despite a decade of exciting research into the  properties of high-temperature superconductors (HTSCs), a  definitive experiment leading to a clear understanding of the  physical mechanism responsible for superconductivity in these  unique materials has not been forthcoming. The goal of this  research program is to exploit the sub-picosecond (shorter than  one-thousand-billionth of a second) temporal resolution provided  by today's laser technology to study the fundamental physical  processes occurring in HTSCs. Specifically, ultrashort pulses of  far-infrared radiation will be used to monitor the response of  HTSCs in an effort to time-resolve the mechanism responsible for  superconductivity in these ceramic materials. These ultrafast  optical investigations will open a new regime of study for  superconductivity in which radiation is used to monitor directly  the electronic dynamics of the superconducting state. The results  from these novel spectroscopic studies should have a significant  impact on our understanding of the unique properties of HTSCs  which, in turn, may lead to the development of superconductors  operating at even higher temperatures. Indeed, similar ultrafast  optical techniques have already improved our understanding and  design of everyday semiconductor devices. The educational  component will involve both undergraduate physics majors and  students from Chicago area high schools in research in the  investigators laboratory that is connected to the goals of the  project.  ***",
