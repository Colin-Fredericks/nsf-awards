 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9870013  Li  The objectives of this research project is to further  develop a recently proposed passive velocity field control  (PVFC) paradigm for the control of mechanical systems,  through the application to two concrete domains; robotic  debarring and teleoperarted manipulator. The new control  paradigm has two unique features, namely that i) it makes  explicit any coordinate requirements of the task for the  system, and ii) it aims to preserve the passivity property  of the closed loop system. Most previous strategies involve  the decomposition of the control task into the design of a  timed trajectory, and the design of a controller to track  the trajectory at each instant in time. This paradigm is  expected to be suited for applications where there is a  strong coordination requirement and where the stable and  intimate interactions with uncertain physical environment  are needed for safe operation. Since the robotic debarring  and teleoperated manipulation applications share these  salient features, these will be suited simultaneously. In  robotic debarring, the coordination requirement requirement  is imposed by the constraint that the tool must follow  precisely the prescribed tool path to avoid unintended  material removals.. Moreover, the debarring tool must  interact with the work piece to be debarred. Inappropriate  interaction between the tool and the work can lead to  instability, damage to the tool, and poor debarring quality.  On the other hand, the coordination requirement for  teleoperated manipulator systems is imposed by the fact that  the motions of both the manipulator that interacts with the  human and of the manipulator performing the actual  manipulation must  mimic each other. In addition, a  teleoperated manipulator must physically  interact with both  the human operator and the work environment. A combine  theoretical and experimental approach will be taken in this  project.***",
