The bottle-neck problem currently exists with hybrid estimation is that existing techniques are not cost-effective enough for most real-world hybrid estimation problems, which involve a large set of modes.  The most serious barrier for the further development of hybrid estimation is associated with the fact that existing techniques are confined to a fixed structure.  In other words, existing hybrid estimation has a fundamental limitation, inherent to the fixed structure, in that it cannot handle effectively problems involving more than just a few modes, which is, unfortunately, the case for most real-world problems.  This limitation stems from the fundamental assumption of the existing techniques that the system mode at any time can be represented accurately by one of a small and fixed set of models that can be determined a priori.  As a result, existing hybrid estimation with a fixed structure has arrived at such a stage that great improvement can no longer be expected within its fixed structure.  Nevertheless, existing research effort is confined almost entirely to this fixed structure.  In this proposal, an investigation of the theory and application of hybrid estimation techniques is proposed.  The theoretical research proposed includes the development of several promising and complementary variable structure algorithms that are highly cost-effective, uncomplicated and general enough to be applicable to most hybrid estimation problems, and some work toward the development of a unified theory of hybrid estimation.\r\n\r\nThe technical approach that will be undertaken for the proposed research is to use variable structure in hybrid estimation:  The set of models, rather than the models themselves, may be made adaptive based on measurement sequences, which carries valuable information about the system mode currently in effect.  This is a promising new direction for improving significantly on the existing techniques, which was initiated by the PI recently.  Its great potential has been demonstrated by the recent development of such an algorithm by the PI that is uncomplicated, generally applicable, and significantly more cost-effective than the state-of-the-art fixed structure hybrid estimators.  This project is expected to have a significant impact on the theoretical and applied research in estimation, decision and identification, and their application areas.  In the short term it will advance significantly the state-of-the-art hybrid estimation techniques, and in the long term, it will provide insight and thrust to future investigation in stochastic systems theory, random signal processing and statistical inference.\r\n\r\nEducation and human resource development are integrated components of the proposed career development plan.  The primary education objective of this plan is to train students to develop ability, knowledge, and skills for scientific inquiry and technological discovery and invention, hence preparing them well for their pursuit of an engineering career.  This is achieved by the following: 1) Provide students opportunities to participate in advnced research projects under innovative and close guidance of the PI; 2) Develop new graduate and undergraduate courses for better educating and training students; 3) Disseminate results from the proposed reseach by textbook writing to reach out to more students.\r\n*** \r\n",
