 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses three areas of research in information-  based complexity:Theory, Applications, Software.    THEORY: A major theme is the study of the computational  complexity of multivariate problems in a large number of  variables.  In particular, the computational complexity of path  integrals, that is, integrals in an infinite number of variables,  will be studied.  Often high dimensional  multivariate problems are intractable in the worst case  deterministic setting.  The research emphasis will be on  conditions which yield tractability and strong tractability in  various settings.    A second research area is to explain why low-discrepancy  sequences are excellent for computing the high dimensional  integrals (often, the dimensionality is in the hundreds) of  mathematical finance.  This belief is based on extensive software  testing but there is no satisfactory theoretical explanation.  The goal is to characterize very high dimensional integrals for  which low-discrepancy sequences are superior  to Monte Carlo.  A third area is to continue research on the  computational complexity of implementation testing for continuous  problems.    APPLICATIONS: The theory will be applied to a number of  application areas, including computational complexity and new  algorithms for combinatorial circuit verification.    SOFTWARE: The FINDER software library contains modifications of  low-discrepancy sequences.  FINDER has been made available to  researchers in various disciplines.  Further improvements, tests,  and dissemination of FINDER are planned.",
