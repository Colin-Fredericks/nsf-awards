 "awd_abstract_narration": "9712141  Takacs    This grant investigates the mechanochemical processes  involved in the initiation of combustion by ball milling.  When a highly exothermic powder mixture is milled, the  mechanical agitation ignites a self-sustained combustion  after an activation time.  Milling is the ideal tool with  which to study the mechanism of mechanochemical reactions  because the ignition phase is a well-defined critical state  in the activation process.  The theoretical modeling  includes consideration of the initiation of combustion by  single collisions of the milling balls and the propagation  of the combustion front away from the impact sites.  The  modeling of ignition is supported by experimental studies of  the interrupted combustion effect, the mutual suppression of  combustion in a mixture of combustive powders, and the  repeated combustion effect.  Reactions with titanium,  zirconium, and hafnium and the formation of chalcogenides  are among the reactions to be examined.  Measurements  include the temperature of the milling vial and activation  times to combustion.  X-ray diffraction and electron  microscopy are used to characterize the powder at different  stages of the process with emphasis on samples taken just  prior to combustion.  The thermal ignition of combustion and  the relaxation of activated samples are studied by  differential thermal analysis and heating curve  measurements.  %%%  The initiation of chemical reactions by ball milling is used  in several technologies, including the preparation of  metastable alloys, refractory powders, and nanocrystalline  materials.  Further advancements depend on improved  fundamental understanding of the complex processes involved.  ***",
