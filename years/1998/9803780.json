One important class of structures is that of self-organizing  data structures, which dynamically maintain a file of records in  easily retrievable order while using up little memory space and which  have been investigated by probabilists and computer scientists for  more than 25 years.  Such self-organizing systems have been applied  to problems in very large-scale integration (VLSI) circuit simulation,  data compression, communications networks, and genetics.  The research  analyzes more realistically complex probability models than have  heretofore been treated, and in doing so provides a unifying framework  for previous studies.  Trees form another important class of  combinatorial structures.  The investigator analyzes the \"shape\" of  random m-ary search trees, fundamental structures in computer science  that also arise naturally in connection with self-organizing data  structures.  The work involves generalizing and analyzing the already  large class of recursive trees, which have been used to model such  things as the spread of epidemics, family trees of ancient  manuscripts, and pyramid schemes.  The researcher also develops a   continuous-time model for pyramid schemes and derives for it  operational characteristics which have not been obtained under the  corresponding discrete-time model.  Another facet of this  work is a generalization of the analysis of the height  of an incomplete digital search tree, or trie; the generalization has  applications to the election of multiple leaders in a computer  network.  This work relates clearly to the Federal  Strategic Area of high-performance computing and communi cation.",
