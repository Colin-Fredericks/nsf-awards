 "awd_abstract_narration": "9801742  Reich    This is an experimental research program designed to characterize  magnetized   states  of  quasi--one--dimensional   quantum   spin  systems, and the critical properties associated with the magnetic  field--induced  T  = 0 phase--transitions into such  states.  The  goals of this work are to (i) determine whether magnetized states  of  spin  chains  share an incommensurate length scale  which  is  inversely  proportional to magnetization as predicted  by  theory  and  (ii)  to provide an experimental counterpart to the  growing  body  of  theoretical  results about quantum critical  phenomena.  This  work  involves  a series of detailed experiments  on  well-  characterized  model systems where the spin  Hamiltonian  can  be  varied  reproducibly through the application of a magnetic field,  and where disorder can be introduced in a controlled fashion.   A  number  of different quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnets  will  be investigated, including linear chains with spin S=1/2 and S=1,  linear  chains  with  bond alternation,  and  spin  ladders.  The  research  involves both graduate and undergraduate  students  who  obtain   a  broad  education  in  experimental  condensed  matter  physics,  from  sample  preparation  through  various  types   of  experiments and analysis to the dissemination of results.  %%%  The goal of this research is to increase the understanding of the  fundamental behavior of many-body quantum physics through  detailed experimental studies of simple magnetic systems. Quantum  spin chains are magnets in which the atomic-scale magnetic  interactions are strong only in one direction in the material.  This one-dimensionality coupled with quantum mechanics produces  systems with novel and beautiful properties where highly  sophisticated theoretical concepts can be put to rigorous  experimental tests. The research involves both graduate and  undergraduate students who obtain a broad education in  experimental condensed matter physics, from materials pre paration  and a variety of cutting-edge experimental techniques to  sophisticated data analysis and the dissemination of results.  ***",
