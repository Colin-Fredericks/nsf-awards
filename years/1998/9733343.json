 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research and education projects will be  carried out under the support of a CAREER award for a period  of five years.       The research component is aimed at the theoretical  study of hadronic structure and dynamics at low and  intermediate energies.  In these domains of energy the  fundamental theory of the strong interactions Quantum  Chromodynamics (QCD) is in a non-perturbative regime making  the use of effective theories necessary.  Among the  effective theories to be utilized are Chiral Perturbation  Theory (ChPT), the 1/N expansion in QCD, and in some cases  dispersion relations.  The topics of research include: a)  low and intermediate energy spin structure of the nucleon,  in particular the study of the generalized Gerasimov-Drell-  Hearn sum rule that will be tested experimentally at TJNAF;  b) tests of chiral symmetry and applications of ChPT to  mesons and baryons (K-meson decays, Goldberger-Treiman  discrepancy, weak decays of baryons, decays of heavy mesons  involving emission of low energy pions or K mesons, etc.);  c) studies involving the expansion in the inverse of the  number of colors in QCD (1/N expansion), in particular  applications to (excited) baryons with the aim at  understanding more clearly the pattern of masses, mixings  and decay widths; d) further study possible improvements to  the mentioned effective theory methods.  The research  component addresses topics of high current experimental  significance at facilities such as TJNAF, and close contact  and collaboration with experimentalists at TJNAF will be  pursued.       The education component is aimed at improving the  teaching of graduate courses in Physics. In particular, the  improvement of material presentation in the class through  the use of computers.  Computers will be used to present  graphical demonstrations in class with the aim at enhancing  the intuitive understanding of the subject discussed.  Material for use in such demonstrations will be developed  first in a Quantum Theory course  and later in others, and  efforts will be made to make such material widely available  to other teachers.  Students will be encouraged to actively  participate in this initiative. The impact of this education  component is expected to be very significant in the further  development of the young Ph.D. program in Physics at Hampton  University.",
