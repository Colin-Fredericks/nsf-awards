The Pecos pupfish, native to the Pecos river, is curently in  jeopardy of extinction due to hybridization with a closely  related introduced species, the Sheepshead minnow.  Within  five years of the introduction, hybrids replaced the native  species in over half of its istoric range.  Several factors  may contribute to the success of hybirds; they may survive  better, grow faster, and be more attractive as mates than  either of the parental species.  Experimental studies of  female mate choice and competitive interactions among males  of the two parental species and their hybrids will determine  whether hybrids have a mating advantage.    Life-history traits, such as growth rate, size at maturity,  and the number of eggs roduced, will be measured to  determine whether they influence the rate of hybridization.  Many native southwestern fishes are threatened by extinction  through hybridization with introduced exotic species.  This  research will provide information about the behavioral and  ecological processes that promote hybridization with  introduced non-native species and more generally, the role  of these processes in sexual selection and species  formation. This research has applications for conservation  and restoration of populations of native species.",
