 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to \"reconnect\" to the mathematical sciences enterprise two and four year college faculty who lack the time to keep up with research developments. The workshops expose them to current research topics in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science that are relevant to their teaching by involving them in a research center where much of the relevant research is being carried out. The project aims to enhance the ability of faculty to transform their classrooms into places that connect up to modern uses of mathematics and computer science and to help them produce classroom materials that reflect current research. Both summer conferences and a sequence of two-day conferences are taking place. The summer conferences, national in scope and directed at two and four-year college faculty with some prior exposure to discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science,  present recent research results in topics such as computational molecular biology, network visualization, clustering, and visibility in geometry, and divide the participants into writing groups. The two-day conferences, regional in scope and directed at two year college faculty with little prior exposure to discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science, present an introduction to these fields, with connection to topics of current research interest, and also involve the participants in writing materials in a six month period between two two-day conferences. Participants in both the two-day and two-week conferences are expected to use the materials they have written as vehicles to bring discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science into their classrooms. Participants are encouraged to make their materials available to a broader audience through developing and publishing them in the DIMACS Undergraduate Module Series.    *",
