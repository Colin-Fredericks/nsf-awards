 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810678  Kutter  centrifuge model testing is an important tool for earthquake  engineers to help understand the engineering deformation and  failure of soils and foundations and their interaction with  structures.  Physical models of these failure and deformation  problems can be constructed and tested while they spin on a  centrifuge.  The centrifuge acceleration field increased the  \"self weight\" of models so that stresses in the model are similar  to those in typical prototypes.  Because soils have nonlinear  material properties, the similarity of stresses in model and  prototype greatly enhances the accuracy of the model tests.  The  centrifuge is an extremely valuable tool for systematic studies  of the effects of earthquakes on soils and soil-structure  interaction.    The new geotechnical centrifuge in Hong Kong will provide a  unique opportunity for engineers to obtain data to study the  effects of two directional (2-D) shaking on soils and soil-  structure systems.  This project will organize an international  symposium to allow researchers in Asia and the U.S. and other  parts of the world to exchange experiences in soil dynamics  research in general and centrifuge model testing in particular.   The workshop will open the possibility of future collaboration  including the sharing of data and facilities and the planning of  complementary research programs.  The possibilities and plans for  networking of the Hong Kong centrifuge with U.S. and  international geotechnical earthquake engineering facilities, as  an extension of the MRE/ 15 HPS concept, will also be discussed  in the symposium.  ***",
