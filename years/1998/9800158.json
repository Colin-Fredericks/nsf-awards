 "awd_abstract_narration": "GERSTEN, 98-00158      Gersten plans to continue his work on homological  invariants in geometric group theory.  He has   given both homological and cohomological characterizations  of hyperbolic groups and a homological characterization  of distortion of a subgroup of a group.  He plans  to use these invariants to study open questions  concerning Gromov's bounded cohomology, the word  problem for finitely presented groups, and the isomorphism  problem for hyperbolic groups, among others.      The area of geometric group theory uses the methods of  geometry to study symmetry.  This turns upside down  F. Klein's Erlanger Program of the 19th century,  which proposed studying a geometry by means of its  symmetries.  For example, in Klein's program the  geometry of the Euclidean plane would be studied  by means of its symmetries, whose generators are  rotations, reflections and parallel motions, whereas  in geometric group theory, one would study which properties  of the symmetries one could recover from Euclidean geometry, when one  ignores small-scale features and concentrates only on what  is visible to a distant observer.  It is a remarkable fact  that the word problem, which concerns  writing a computer program to decide when two symmetries  are the same when they are written in terms of generators,   depends only on the large-scale geometry.  The word problem is  a paradigm for a large class of problems which  can be studied by the methods of this area.",
