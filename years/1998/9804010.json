 "awd_abstract_narration": "9804010  Project LEAP investigates the use of lightweight, empirical,  anti-measurement dysfunction, and portable approaches to  software developer improvement. A lightweight method involves a  minimum of process constraints, is relatively easy to learn, is  amenable to integration with existing methods and tools, and  requires only minimal management investment and commitment. An  empirical method supports measurements that can lead to  improvements in the software developers skill. Measurement  dysfunction refers to the possibility of measurements being used  against the programmer, so the method must take care to collect  and manipulate measurements in a ``safe'' manner. A portable  method is one that can be applied by the developer across  projects, organizations, and companies during her career.  Project LEAP evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of this  approach by creating a LEAP-compliant toolset and method for  process data entry and analysis. The toolset and method will  be experimentally evaluated at a number of industry sites,  and used to explore the effects of the toolkit on the quality of  empirical data collected by the Personal Software Process. Web-  based materials for distance-based education on empirical  software engineering will be deployed using the toolset.***",
