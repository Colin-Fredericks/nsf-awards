 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intercellular communication is essential to the development of numerous cell types in every metazoan studied. Often, such communication is achieved through the action of growth factors (GFs) that are expressed by cells adjacent to their target cells, and that bind to and activate specific receptors located on the surface of the target cell. The receptor then activates a series of downstream signaling molecules that ultimately act to alter gene expression and cellular functions. In lower eukaryotes, the analysis of mutants that are defective for various signaling molecules have provided valuable information about structure-function relationships of different signaling molecules and about interactions between different components of signaling pathways. However, similar genetic analyses in higher eukaryotes are usually much more limited.  The proposed research focuses on the role of mast cell growth factor (Mgf), the ligand for the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase, in development of several cell lineages in mice. Both Mgf and Kit are highly conserved in all vertebrates and are structurally and functionally related to other GFs and receptors. Interestingly, the Mgf/Kit pathway is required for development of diverse types of cells, including erythrocytes, mast cells, melanocytes and germ cells. While many functions of Mgf and Kit in these different cells must overlap, there is accumulating evidence for some cell-restricted functions. A powerful genetic resource for studying this pathway is a large collection (>40) of different mouse alleles at the locus encoding Mgf, called Steel (SI), and the locus encoding Kit, called Dominant spotting (W). Such large allelic series are unusual in the mouse, as only a few other loci in the mouse have more than one or two mutant alleles. Furthermore, this is the only mammalian receptor-ligand pair where large numbers of mutant alleles of each gene are available. The studies described in this proposal are aimed at understanding the molecular and developmental deficiencies in 16 different SI mutants. Based on the results of these studies, future experiments will characterize the biochemical defect(s) associated with each mutant. Ultimately, all of these studies should provide a wealth of information on the functions of this important signaling molecule during in viva development of diverse types of cells.",
