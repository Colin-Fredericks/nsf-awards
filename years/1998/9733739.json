 "awd_abstract_narration": "Telephone call centers constitute a large, but hidden, industry in the United States   (US), and their use continues to grow rapidly.  They are used extensively for reservation-taking in the travel industry and for providing customer services in retail financial services and telecommunications.  `Inbound` call centers, which provide customer service and take orders for customer-initiated sales, are queueing systems: a customer phones in; if all customer service representatives (CSRs) are busy, she waits in queue; when a CSR becomes free she is switched to the CSR and service begins.  Relatively little research in the management science literature has been devoted to the   analysis of call center performance and control, and important features of call center   operations have not been addressed by this literature.  Many of those features have to   do with the fact that it is people, rather than `jobs,` that require service and that it   is people, rather than equipment, that do the processing.    Research questions include the following.  (1) How much does customer waiting time cost   an organization?  Little work has been done to model the costs that congestion incurs   through the erosion of consumer satisfaction.  (2) A typical center fields many types of   calls, and CSRs may be cross-trained in a number of types of call.  How should one train   workers for this environment?  Of the many workers that may be qualified to handle an   incoming call, to whom should that call be routed?  (3) Workers learn on the job and get   better as they accumulate experience.  They also `turn over` (quit or are fired).  In this   case, what are the tradeoffs among direct labor costs, costs associated with turnover,   and customer waiting costs?  The call center environment is a fascinating vehicle for these lines of research precisely   because it is an example of a relatively simple production system in which marketing,   human-resource, and operational problems are all intertwined.  We think of the telephone   call center as a simple model for more complex systems and believe that a better understanding   of call centers will ultimately offer insight into how important human factors should be   accounted for in the management of a broad range of modern service systems.  The project's educational plan also seeks to foster students' understanding of how human   factors should be accounted for in the management of service systems.  To achieve this   goal, research findings and insights will be incorporated into the curricula of a number   of introductory undergraduate and masters courses.  Similarly, integrative materials,   such as cases and simulation exercises, will be developed to help students in more advanced   courses to better understand these problems.  Finally, Ph.D. education and training will   help to promote the integration of traditional management science models with more   behaviorally-oriented decision sciences.",
