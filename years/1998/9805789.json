 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has long been suggested that stress, especially chronic  stress, can alter the way in which our bodies normally  function.  Stress (both physiological and psychological)  alters various immune functions, which could potentially be  an important factor in linking chronic stress to a variety  of physiological abnormalities.  More recently, scientists  have become interested in the interactions between stress,  the immune system, and the brain.  There is a growing body  of evidence that stress can stimulate chemical secretions  from immune cells (these chemicals are called cytokines),  and that these cytokines can in turn alter specific brain  functions. This POWRE award will investigate the  relationship among immune, neuroendocrine and brain  function. This project is particularly suited  for a POWRE  award because it will allow exploratory work to determine  the feasibility of a new line of inquiry for Dr. Wayne. The  purpose of the proposed work is to investigate the effects  of cytokines on the function of a subset of cells from the  brain - neuroendocrine cells that are responsible for  secreting a hormone that controls reproductive behavior. An  animal model with a simple nervous system, the marine  mollusk Aplysia, will be used.  The rationale for using  Aplysia in the proposed studies is that, unlike with most  higher organisms, their neuroendocrine cells can be easily  identified in living tissue.  That means that we are able to  monitor the physiological response of these brain cells to  cytokines; we can measure changes in both their electrical  and secretory activities in response to chemicals that are  secreted by stress-activated immune cells.  Furthermore,  marine invertebrates have a primitive immune system that is  functionally analogous to that of mammals, including  cytokines and stress-related hormones that appear to be  structurally similar to their mammalian counterparts.  The  objective of this proposal is to develop the reproductive  neuroendocrine cells of Aplysia as a  model system to  understand the effects of cytokines, and in particular  interleukins and neurotrophins, on membrane excitability and  downstream neuroendocrine cell functions by addressing the  following specific aims: 1) determine the effects of  interleukins and neurotrophins on neuroendocrine-membrane  excitability and hormone secretion, and 2) determine the  effects of interleukins and neurotrophins on hormone mRNA  levels and hormone biosynthesis in Aplysia neuroendocrine  cells.",
