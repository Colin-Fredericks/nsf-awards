Clements of Worcester Polytechnic Institute to work with  Professor Antonio Simoes Costa at the Universidade Federal  de Santa Catarina in Florianopolis, Brazil on the study of  optimal power flow methods in competitive electricity  markets.    Optimal power flow is a tool which can be used to look at  the problem of figuring the marginal costs of electricity.  In computing these costs, several constraints must be taken  into account such as physical lower and upper limits for  individual generators, security-related transmission loading  limits of transmission lines, and the required amount of  reactive support.  By developing this tool, they can model  consumer demand elasticity as well as consumer energy use.  They will develop models in parallel in Brazil and the  United States.  Both sides have been working on this problem  and by joining research teams and facilities, they can  advance their research more quickly and efficiently.        ***",
