The final product of this planning will be an exhibit with a traveling component and additional complementary activities that will heighten the public's understanding of the processes of science.  It is the Smithsonian's intention that visitors will experience the processes of science by direct inquiry into the nature of science as a way of thinking and knowing the world.  With this award, they will plan the 8000 sq. ft. permanent exhibit, a smaller scale traveling exhibit, various public programs, and an Icon.  The large exhibit will consist of five stations: What is Scientific?,  How is Science Done?, What Influences Have Tool and Instrumentation Had on Science?, How is Science Used?, and How is Science Communicated?.  Managed by the Office of the Provost, the planning activities will include 1) meetings of SI staff and advisors that have diverse perspectives including scientists, educators, exhibit designers, and evaluators, among others; 2) charettes on the exhibit design and visitors perceptions and expectation of science issues, 3) the drafting of concepts and text for the exhibit activities, and 4) final review of all elements by SI management.  At the end of the planing period it is their intention to have all the plans in place in order to move forward on the implementation phase.",
