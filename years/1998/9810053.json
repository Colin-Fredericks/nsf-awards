 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Suppes - 9810053  In organic chemistry, solvents can have a large impact on reactions.  Free radical reactions are considered to be less dependent upon the solvent; however, even free-radical reaction rates can vary by greater than three orders of magnitude.  The ability to use solvents is a powerful design degree of freedom when designing processes, due to the solvent's ability to reduce required reactor sizes as well as the solvent's ability to change selectivities.  The electronic properties of the solvent tend to dominate trends in performance.    Much work has been done on methods to predict chemical phenomena such as phase equilibrium, reaction equilibrium, and reaction rates.  These efforts have resulted in the development of models which can, for example, rapidly predict vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibrium data with a reasonable degree of certainty.  This work will be an effort to develop such models for predicting reaction rates in supercritical fluid solvents.    Ideal gas reaction rates will provide reference states that are perturbed to non-ideal reaction conditions in supercritical fluids.  Molecular modeling will be used to model and then predict changes in ideal gas reaction rates which have been used successfully in software called CHEMKIN to model hydrocarbon oxidation in water near the critical point.  The reaction rates will be perturbed into and through the supercritical region --- as close to liquid phase reactions as is practical.  The research approach includes:     o gathering sufficient reaction rate data on two model reactions in near- and supercritical water and supercritical carbon dioxide,     o using available CHEMKIN software to evaluate detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms used to model the systems which are experimentally investigated, and     o using molecular modeling techniques to model and predict the impact of the solvent on the potential energy surface, thereby improving the rate constants of key reactions in the kinetic mechanisms.",
