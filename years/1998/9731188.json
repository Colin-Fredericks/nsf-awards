 "awd_abstract_narration": "9731188  CARIGNAN  This proposal requests support for shipboard scientific support equipment for the research SAVANNAH to be operated by the  Skidaway Institute of Oceanography, and dedicated to use in  support of ocean science research.      The Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment Program provides funds for ship equipment deemed essential to the proper and safe conduct of ocean science research. This Program provides support for such  items as deck equipment including winch systems for the deployment and retrieval of scientific instruments, navigational equipment such as radars, gyroscopes and earth satellite receivers to pin  point the location of research sites, communication equipment including radio transceivers and satellite transceivers for voice and scientific data communications and other equipment such as motorized workboats for transporting scientists to and from data retrieval sites.    The Project Director, Steven J. Carignan is fully qualified to direct this project having had considerable experience in overseeing the acquisition and installation of shipboard equipment.    This project will assist the institution in the outfitting of the R/V SAVANNAH which will replace the R/V BLUE in 1999.  The R/V SAVANNAH is being built with institution funds.  NSF funds will be used to acquire an A-Frame, a J-Frame, a CTD winch, a workboat and several safety related items.    ***",
