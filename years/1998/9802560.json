The goals are to find ways to fabricate and  assemble  simple  circuits  from nanotubes, and to assess  the  properties.  Samples of single wall nanotubes will be synthesized and supplied  for  these studies by research groups at Rice University and  the  CNRS  group at Montpellier, France. The experimental program will  structurally  characterize samples using  X-ray  diffraction  and  electron  microscopy,  explore  modification  of  the  electronic  properties  by  chemical doping, and develop  new  protocols  for  separation,   manipulation,  and  assembly  of   nanotube-derived  structures using advanced electron microscopy and scanning  probe  manipulation. New methods for establishing electrical contact  to  tube-derived  structures  will  be  developed.  Theory   of   the  electronic phenomena in these structures willl be studied with an  emphasis  on  understanding the effects of intertube interactions  in  tube  clusters and tube bundles, and the effects of  contacts  and   linkages  between  tubes  on  the  experimentally  observed  electronic properties. This research program is interdisciplinary  in  nature  and  involves one or more postdoctoral  and  graduate  students,  who  receive  excellent training  in  preparation  for  careers in industry, government laboratories or academia.  %%%  This experimental focused research group project seeks to explore  ways   of   making  nano-meter  -scale  electron   devices   from  \"nanotubes\".  Nanotubes  are hollow cylinders  of  carbon  atoms,  arranged  in chemical bonds similar to those in graphite  (pencil  lead).  Nanotubes are closely related to \"buckyballs\", which  are  hollow  balls composed of 60 carbon atoms, arranged in a  fashion  resembling a (nano-meter-scale) soccer ball. A nanometer  is  one  bil lionth  of a meter, or about 10 atomic diameters or  about  20  millionths  of  the  diameter  of a  human  hair.  Nanotubes  are  electrical conductors and are considered to have potential for  a  nano-meter  scale  electronics technology  of  the  future.  This  research  project  is  devoted  to  manipulation,  assembly   and  electronic properties of carbon nanotubes. The goals are to  find  ways  to  fabricate and assemble simple circuits from  nanotubes,  and  to  assess the properties. Samples of single wall  nanotubes  will  be  synthesized and supplied for these studies by  research  groups  at  Rice University and by the CNRS group at Montpellier,  France.
