 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditional composite shear walls consist of a plate with a concrete wall on one or both sides of the steel plate and boundary columns and beams.  By properly combining the advantages of the reinforced concrete and steel plate shear walls, and by eliminating or reducing their disadvantages, and efficient composite shear wall system can result such as innovative version of the composite shear wall systems, had great potential to become a very efficient and high performance lateral lead resisting system.  This project will study and develop seismic design recommendations for the wall systems.  \r\nThe following interrelated analytical and experimental investigations will be conducted.\r\n\r\nInelastic finite element parametric studies of the traditional composite shear walls and the new system,\r\n\r\nParametric inelastic time-history analyses of the global and local seismic responses of structures with both types of shear walls\r\n\r\nCyclic tests of four two-story specimens representing composite shear wall systems,\r\n\r\nDeveloping seismic design recommendations for composite shear wall systems,\r\n\r\nFinally, after design recommendations have been formulated, the recommendations will be applied to design of at least two structures with composite shear walls.  Then, inelastic time history response analysis of the structures will be conducted to verify desirable performance of the structures. .\r\n\r\nThis \r\n",
