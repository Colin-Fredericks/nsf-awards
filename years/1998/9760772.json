 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9760772  Kittrell    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to establish the technical and economic feasibility of an Adsorption-Integrated-Reaction (AIR) technology, and provide a system to destroy volatile organic compounds (VOCS) in applications with high flow rates of air and dilute contaminant concentrations.  The research program will provide a new, multicomponent, zeolite-based photocatalytic adsorbent, shown to be much more active than traditional titania photocatalysts. It will consist of synthesis and evaluation of catalyst compositions, kinetic studies of destruction efficiency on representative classes of VOCS, and a comparative cost analysis of the resulting photocatalytic technology relative to other emissions control alternatives.  It is anticipated than an effective dilute phase pollution control concept will be developed, which will provide a cost-effective technology for destroying VOCs in high flow rate air with dilute VOC concentrations.    The commercial applications for the concept will be for control of air pollution (a) by destruction of air emissions of VOCs from soil and groundwater remediation, (b) from industrial emissions, and (c) for enhanced indoor air quality. The technology will reduce the costs of air pollution control, enhance environmental quality, and improve economic competitiveness.  ***",
