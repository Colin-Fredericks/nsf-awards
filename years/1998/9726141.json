 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726141  Marsh    Systematics of the Parasitoid Wasp Subfamily Doryctinae in Costa Rica (Insecta, Hymenoptera, Braconidae)    Wasps of the family Braconidae are parasites of other insects and are therefore important in the biological control of agricultural and forest pests. The first step in any successful control program is knowledge of the parasites and of which pests they are effective in controlling. Yet our knowledge of these particular parasites is very meager. The purpose of this project is to study one group of these wasps and to provide a workable classification, and to produce identification aids for the genera and species found in Costa Rica. Most of the specimens to be studied are located in the collection of the Instituto National de Biodiversidad in San Jose, Costa Pica (INBio). Specimens from this large collection, as well as from collections from other parts of the world, will provide the basis for this study. These wasps usually attack bark beetle pests in forests, and knowledge of their classification and identification will provide new information for potential forest biological control programs in the United States as well as in Central America. Furthermore, this study will provide valuable information for biodiversity studies in endangered habitats in Costa Pica as well as in all of Central America.",
