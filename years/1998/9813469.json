 "awd_abstract_narration": "Julius H. Jackson & Patricia A. Herring    Summary      The  goal  of  the  proposed study is to  identify  the  genomic  origin  of  any prokaryotic gene based solely upon the  nucleotide  sequence.  Protein-coding nucleotide sequences  characteristically  contain  bases  that  tend to repeat at three-step  intervals,  or  period-3  base  repeats.  Based upon  prior  work  revealing  that  heterologous genes from an individual bacterial chromosome  tended  to  construct the period-3 base repeats using a pattern common  to  genes  from  the same chromosome, we propose to determine  whether  patterns   of  period-3  repeats  constitute  genome  labels   for  phylogenetically distinct bacteria. The hypothesis  to  be  tested  is:  The pattern of bases comprising a period-3 repeat pattern  in  protein-coding genes is measurably similar to that of other  genes  from  the  same genome. A component signal analysis  of  the  base  composition  of  period-3 repeats will be used as  inputs  for  an  artificial  neural  net to assist in analyzing  the  relationships  between  the  periodic information and the genes and genomes  that  are  sources  of  the  data. Possibly, such  a  signal  marks  the  evolutionary  and genetic history of a gene. Reading that  history  might tell where the gene has been and for approximately how long.  In  addition to characterizing system labels for chromosomes, this  study   could   potentially   provide  information   critical   to  understanding  the early history of chromosome formation  and  the  impact  of  gene  flow  on  gene and  genome  assembly.  A  nearly  immediate impact could be the detection of informational labels to  track gene flow, and determine the hosts of origin of genes moving  through  cell  populations  in nature.  This  study  may  make  it  possible  to identify the prokaryotic host of origin for any  gene  found anywhere.",
