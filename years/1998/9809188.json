 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of defensive projection suggests that when people are motivated to avoid seeing certain faults in themselves, they contrive instead to see those same faults in others. This concept helps to explain why many people regard their rivals and opponents as exploitative and unscrupulous, and also how people form stereotypes of groups whose members they scarcely know. In this project, a new framework is being developed for understanding when and how people become prone to seeing in other people the qualities they would least like in themselves. The research is aimed at developing a deeper understanding of the relationship between trait possession and defensive projection. Projection plays an important role in interpersonal problems. Similarly, other social scientists have speculated that projection is a psychological process that contributes to intergroup hostility and conflict. Designing effective interventions to ameliorate the pain and distress caused by projection will depend on a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying it and the circumstances in which it is likely to occur.",
