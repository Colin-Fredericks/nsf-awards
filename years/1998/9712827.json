The AWM will hold six additional  workshops in conjunction with major mathematical meetings during  1998-2000: each of the annual joint meetings of the AMS and MAA  and each of the annual SIAM meetings.  The workshop participants  will be selected by a panel of mathematicians on the basis of a  competitive application process.  They will be asked to present  their research at the workshop in a manner suitable for a general  mathematical audience.  They will have the opportunity to meet  and interact with each other and with assigned mentors, as well  as with other established women mathematicians.  The workshops  will also include panels, discussions, an informal luncheon, and  a dinner.    In addition, a minisymposium is planned for the International  Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM) in  Scotland (summer 1999).  The minisymposium will consist of  research presentations by four outstanding women mathematicians  who have received the Ph.D. degree within the past five years.",
