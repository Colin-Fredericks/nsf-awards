 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reversible Cellular Automata (RCA) are locally computed parallel  one-to-one mappings of cellular space onto itself.  They provide  a solid theoretical model for massively parallel non-dissipative  computation.  This project investigates the theory of RCA and  closely related Quantum Cellular Automata (QCA), and introduces  new applications in image compression and cryptography.  The main  theoretical goal is to understand the structure of RCA and find  new representations of RCA in terms of simple local operations.  The representations should allow easy generation of new RCA rules  that can be used in the applications.  Most useful  representations are ones that allow desired properties to be  programmed directly into the RCA.  Quantum CA are generalizations  of RCA.  The first goal is to find a correct definition of QCA in  the sense that it is realizable in the actual physical world with  quantum interactions.  The definition should be also general  enough to allow implementations of arbitrary quantum algorithms.  Then the relation between QCA and homogeneous arrays of finite  quantum gates will be determined.  Image compression applications  arise from analogy to subband coding.  Reversible Cellular  Automata are interpreted as non-linear versions of perfect  reconstruction filter banks.  Energy compaction by linear  transforms is replaced by the idea of information compaction by  RCA.  The new compression techniques will be most suitable for  efficient lossless compression but also lossy image compression  applications are considered.  In addition, analogy to RCA theory  provides new insight into the theory of higher dimensional filter  banks.  In cryptography the project continues investigating the  feasibility and security of RCA based cryptosystems.  Applications to image compression and cryptography, together with  related results on finite automata in fractal image generation  and compression will be introduced to the computer science  curriculum through standard computation theory cou rses.  They  provide practical examples of how automata theory can be useful  in seemingly unrelated fields, and increase student motivation to  study challenging theoretical concepts.  A new graduate course  and seminar on image compression will be developed with emphasis  on algorithmic aspects of compression in addition to the  traditional signal processing approach.",
