 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 1996 Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) makes fundamental changes in national goals with respect to pesticide regulation and use.  This project will analyze the normative and conceptual issues underlying the shift, particularly with respect to `consumer right-to-know` provisions.  The multi-disciplinary team of investigators will identify the nature and kinds of values to which the legislation responds, examining values ranging from trespass and wrongful harm to efficiency and wealth production, in relationship to right-to-know provisions in the law.  They will review federal and state programs and policies, as well as the food information and consumer right-to-know literatures, with particular attention to measures of effectiveness and perceptions of fairness, and to ways to adapt lessons from published experience to the FQPA requirements.  This comprehensive catalogue of consumer right-to-know strategies and federal and state programs and policies will be classified according to which values and interests they serve.  The investigation will discuss the civil, social, economic, industrial, and moral implications of the analysis and propose guidelines for consideration by legislators, regulators, and others.  It will identify a series of qualitative and quantitative research projects whose results could help to support, refute, or augment the recommendations.  The project will result in papers, presentations, and a book.",
