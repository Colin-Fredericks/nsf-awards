 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800561  Engel  The  construction industry can benefit from  the  novel  FRP  architectures and structures that result from  the  flexible  manufacturing   processes  associated  with  the   composite  manufacturing  industries.  Certain methods,  like  filament  winding,  pultrusion and fiber placement lend themselves  to  the   production of grid or cage structures  that  are  well  suited  as reinforcements in beams and columns.  The project  goal  is  to extend the previous work of a Small  Grant  for  Exploratory Research (SGER) wherein 2-D grids were designed,  manufactured  and  tested  in an effort  to  understand  the  effect  of joint architecture on the ability of the grid  to  transmit load.  Various architectures with different degrees  of interconnectivity between layers and between longitudinal  and transverse grid elements were manufactured and tested in  concrete  via pullout tests as well as bending tests.   That  initial work will be extended to investigate the effects  of  other  design  parameters,  in particular  combined  loading  (flexure  and shear) with emphasis shifting from grid  joint  architecture to overall grid structure.    The investigation will include the following tasks:          Task  1:  Development  of  design  procedures  for  2-  dimensional  grid reinforced beams subjected to flexure  and  shear.            Task   2:   Development   of   2-dimensional    grid  configurations to resist flexure and shear.          Task  3: Identification and implementation of a  field  trial of FRP grid reinforcement.         Task 4: Three dimensional grids will be formed from the  2-D  grids,  and 3-D grids will be produced as a  continuous  cage.    The  education  plan  focuses on establishing  an  FRP  grid  database,   and   encouraging  composite  manufacturers   to  continue  their  development of  products  relevant  to  the  reinforced concrete industry.  ***",
