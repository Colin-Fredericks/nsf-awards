 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported in the   Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focuses on the development of   new optical microscopy methods, based on near field optics, which allow   the direct, in vivo imaging of biological processes on the cellular and   sub-cellular scales.  Professor Tan and his students at the University of   Florida will develop a suite of analytical methods which hold the promise   of monitoring biological events with nanometer-range spatial resolution.    Optical sensors of this scale will be developed for representative   mineral and enzymatic species, calcium ion and glutamate.  This CAREER   research project will expose students to the interdisciplinary aspects of   biomedical sciences and chemical instrumentation.  Professor Tan will be   a key figure in the development of a joint bioanalytical chemistry   program between the Department of Chemistry and the University of Florida   Brain Institute.  One of the long standing issues in the area of cellular biology has been   the desire to observe chemical phenomena on the single-cell level.    Professor Tan and his students at the University of Florida are   developing imaging techniques based on near field optical methods which   address this very important area of research.  Instrumentation having   sub-micrometer spatial resolution and microsecond time resolution would   impact a number of disciplines.  The multidisciplinary aspects of the   instrumentation development portion of the project are complemented by   Professor Tan's new `Bioanalytical Chemistry` course for graduates and   advanced undergraduates and the establishment of a collaborative program   with the University of Florida Brain Institute.",
