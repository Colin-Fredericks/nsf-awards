 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802423  Rozovskii   Each time an outfielder tracks and catches a fly ball, he intuitively solves  a   problem of target tracking. That problem has stymied engineers,  mathematicians, and   computer scientists for years. Two great  mathematicians, American, Norbert Wiener and   Russian, Andrey Kolmogorov,  first approached the problem during World War II. Rather   than catching fly  balls, Kolmogorov and Wiener were trying, in the days before   computers, to  develop mathematical algorithms that would help to track enemy aircraft   by  radar. The research started by Kolmogorov and Wiener has developed into a  thriving   area of applied mathematics known as Filtering Theory.  Filtering,  estimation of a signal   or an image from noisy data, is the basic component  of the data assimilation in target   tracking. It is of central importance in  navigation, image and signal processing, control   theory, automatic tracking  systems and other areas of engineering and science. This   research is a joint collaborative effort between researchers at the Institute of  Mathematics   and Informatics, Vilnius, Lithuania, and researchers at the University of Southern   California. The project is devoted to  applications of stochastic partial differential   equations to nonlinear filtering. The focus of the research is twofold: (1) Cauchy-  boundary  problems for parabolic partial differential equations arising in nonlinear  filtering   of stochastic processes evolving under some constraints; and (2)  nonlinear filtering with   distributed observation and applications to  tracking of low-observable targets in images.   The research will also consider the  numerical aspects of nonlinear filtering. It is expected   that relatively simple nonlinear filtering algorithms which are not too demanding in    computational and memory requirements for on-line implementation and yet  are nearly   optimal from a statistical viewpoint will be developed for a wide variety of applications.   The applications include air traffic  control,  human-computer interfaces based on motion-  capture, and advanced optical and  magnetic registration systems.",
