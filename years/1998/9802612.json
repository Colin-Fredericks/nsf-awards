Of primary interest are  versions of the Gromov-Witten and Seiberg-Witten invariants for  families of symplectic structures.  Bryan's project will apply  these invariants to various problems in enumerative algebraic  geometry, symplectic geometry, and low-dimensional topology.  Specifically, he will use his techniques to solve large classes  of enumerative problems for K3 surfaces, Abelian varieties and  other elliptic surfaces.  He will extend these techniques to  compute Gromov-Witten invariants for higher dimensional varieties  in order to verify predictions made by mirror symmetry.  He will  use Seiberg-Witten theory for families to investigate the extent  to which the K3 surface is characterized by its twistor family.  He will extend his techniques developed in earlier work for  studying cyclic group actions on 4-manifolds using Seiberg-Witten  theory.  The extended techniques should apply to other groups,  to 3-manifolds, and to real structures on algebraic surfaces.    Recent progress made by theoretical physicists in super-symmetric  string theories have led to many intriguing and largely  conjectural interconnections between very different aspects  of geometry and topology.  Bryan's project will elucidate  some of the geometry that underlies these physical theories;  physicists hope super-symmetric string theory will eventually  give a complete theory of the universe.",
