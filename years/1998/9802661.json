 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design of application-specific embedded computing  systems is done as hardware/software co-design to jointly  optimize the hardware platform and software executing on  that platform.  This research is investigating two aspects  of the co-analysis of embedded computing systems: memory  systems and sensitivity analysis.  The goal is to obtain co-  synthesis analysis methods which can guide synthesis  decisions.  Embedded computers have hierarchical memory  systems with caching to keep the processors busy.  Since  these systems are often real-time, the software must execute  to performance bounds even in the presence of caching to  keep the processors busy.  Models for finding bounds  on  execution time in the presence of caches, and make effective  use of available hardware, are being studied.  Also, co-  synthesis algorithms need to analyze the sensitivity of the  system to the characteristics of the components.  Sensitivity analysis can tell how much system performance  changes as the execution speed of a component changes.  Sensitivity measures, which can be used in the inner loop of  co-synthesis to help guide optimization choices, are being  explored.  The co-analysis methods are being evaluated in  the context of co-synthesis algorithms.",
