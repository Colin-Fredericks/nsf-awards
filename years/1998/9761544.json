 "awd_abstract_narration": "***   9761544  Park    The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop core software modules for burr prediction in metal cutting, which are part of an integrated suite of specialized software tools for design and manufacturing.  These tools are aimed at 1) predicting and minimizing buff formation in machining and 2) selecting and planning deburring operations, based upon these predicted buff characteristics.  Buff prediction models and corresponding model-driven burr prediction software modules will be developed.  These modules (one for milling and another for drilling) will serve as the basic buff prediction engines of the \"Edge Finishing Master\", a comprehensive burr minimization and deburring process planning software tool.  This software will support the design for manufacturability of mechanical components by introducing burr minimization during design and process planning.    Potential commercial applications are expected in industries with burr problems.  These manufacturing industries include aerospace, automotive, computer components, biomedical, chemical, heavy equipment, and optical.  This software is will be integrated with commercial computer-aided design (CAD) packages, commercial process planning packages, and commercially available tooling and material databases.  The burr prediction and minimization capabilities of this software can be utilized in the early design and process planning stages of a part, allowing the maximum flexibility for adjustments to the part design and manufacturing plan before major resources have been committed.  ***",
