 "awd_abstract_narration": "9714311  Webster   The objective of the research is to develop theoretical  tools for the feasibility study and the design of a floating  runway for commercial air traffic in protected waters.  There are three technical issues which govern the  feasibility of a floating runway: structure, dynamic  response and mooring.  Since the light structures of shallow  depth like floating runway are typically very flexible, the  dynamic response of these runways to a variety of loads  including waves, earthquakes, and the landing and taking off  of aircraft needs to be small enough to avoid the structural  failure and not to affect the airplane operations.  Finally,  mooring system must resist loads resulting from the action  of wind, waves, currents and tides without failing.    In the proposed research the runway will be modeled as  orthotropic plate which we can use to analyze and optimize  the horizontal distribution of the stiffness.  The motion of  the plate will be dynamically coupled with hydrodynamic  loading from the free-surface motion of the surrounding  fluid and with the mooring system.  For determination of the  hydrodynamic loads, the fluid region under the runway and  outside the runway will be modeled by Green-Naghdi theory.    The research will provide designers of these new platforms  the tools necessary to analyze critical problems associated  with these new platforms: motions and structural  optimization, effects of earthquakes and tsunamis, mooring  loads and localized slamming loads.  All of these problems  must be addressed before a design can be considered feasible  and at the present time are no comprehensive tools available  to perform this analysis.  ***",
