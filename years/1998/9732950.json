 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of methods for the assembly   of porphyrin building blocks into multi-component arrays and materials.    Discrete, ordered arrays of five to ten porphyrins will be self-assembled   and characterized using coordination of exocyclic ligands on the   macrocycle to metal centers with appropriate coordination geometry,   complimentary hydrogen bond molecular recognition groups and a hybrid   metal ion and hydrogen bond mediated approach.  One- two- and   three-dimensional porphyrin films, polymers and crystals will be prepared   and new methods developed for the characterization of these materials.    Also, new photonic materials will be prepared via self-assembly.  The   focus of the educational activities will be the development of a course   in supramolecular chemistry and efforts geared to high school science   outreach.  With this Faculty Early Development (CAREER) award, the   Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research   and educational activities of Dr. Charles M. Drain of the Department of   Chemistry at CUNY Hunter College.   Professor Drain will focus his   research efforts on the synthesis and characterization of new materials.    Arrays of five to ten porphyrins will be self-assembled to evaluate the   possible formation of these materials, the mechanism of electron and   energy transfer via non-covalent interactions and the process of   self-assembly.  The overall hypothesis to be evaluated is that highly   ordered photo-active films, polymers and crystals may be systematically   engineered by programming the correct bonding code into self-assembling   monomers.  The educational activities in the project include course   development  and out reach to high school students.",
