 "awd_abstract_narration": "Reilly  9727212         In vertebrate locomotion there is a general paradigm  that limb postures in tetrapods have evolved from a  sprawling posture, with the limbs held laterally to the  body, to an erect posture, with the limbs held directly  under the body.  Accordingly, a three grade system  (sprawling, semi-erect , and erect postures) has been widely  used to categorize locomotor anatomies and their presumed  functional mechanisms in tetrapods.  However, to define and  understand this biomechanical transition, we need data on  the ground reaction forces generated by the footfalls of a  variety of animals using different postural grades to be  able to understand how the dynamics of propulsive forces  change with limb position during locomotion.       The goal of this project is to develop a four-step  force plate system to record ground reaction forces from  small vertebrate animals.  The system will be designed for  the size and gait characteristics of a series of vertebrates  representing all of the classes.  Force plates will be  constructed and calibrated and then preliminary studies of  representative species will be undertaken to demonstrate the  utility of the system and to prepare for larger scaled  integrative studies that will simultaneously record ground  reaction force , kinematic and electomyographical patterns  in species spanning the sprawling to erect transition.",
