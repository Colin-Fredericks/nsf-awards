 "awd_abstract_narration": "Groundwater contamination impacts a significant portion of  our nation's water supply.  In-situ air sparging has proven  to be both an efficient and a cost-effective method for  remediating saturated soils and groundwater contaminated  with volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including light  nonaqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) such as benzene as well as  dense nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) such as  trichloroethylene.  The current design of field air sparging  systems is empirical, based solely on pilot tests and past  experience.  As a result, the present implementation of  field systems often requires extensive modification in  design during the remediation program in order to improve  air sparging performance - leading to larger expenditures of  time and money.  This research will develop a rational design basis for air  sparging field operations by:  1) conducting controlled,  idealized laboratory experiments to investigate air flow  patterns and the resulting mass transfer/transport processes  that occur during air sparging; 2) developing a  comprehensive mathematical model that accurately  incorporates the major contaminant mass transfer/transport  mechanisms and validating it using the results f the  laboratory testing; 3) assembling and assessing the  performance of air sparging systems implemented in the field  under different geologic and contaminant conditions, and 4)  using the extensive field air sparging data to validate the  numerical model.  The laboratory experiments will have the  following specific objectives:  1) investigate the effects  of soil stratigraphy and groundwater flow on air sparging  performance; 2) evaluate the effects of VOC type, form, and  location, including LNAPL and DNAPL pools on air sparging  removal efficiency; 3) verification of laboratory studies  through the laboratory remediation of actual field soils,  and 4) perform a comparison on laboratory simulation results  with field performance data and develop a conceptual air  sparging model.  The resulting conceptual model can be used to develop or  validate mathematical models, permitting field systems to be  designed on a rational basis in the future.  Because air  sparging is a viable remedial option at so many contaminated  sites, an optimization of the design process that this  research will provide will offer enormous financial  benefits.",
