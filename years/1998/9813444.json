 "awd_abstract_narration": "During its first three years of existence, NJCATE has made substantial progress in reshaping technology education, broadening awareness of the role technicians play in the global economy, and expanding partnerships in Center activities.  Through the development of the Mecomtronics Engineering Technology Program, NJCATE has produced a model that provides a unique approach to the creation of curriculum for technician programs.    The NJCATE curriculum model provides a process and the procedures for the creation of integrated, interdisciplinary engineering technology programs.  The development of the new Mecomtronics Engineering Technology program was the vehicle for the design and testing of the curriculum development model which is transferable to all other engineering and science technology disciplines.    NJCATE will continue serving as a resource and catalyst for the continuous renewal and improvement of technician education to prepare graduates for successful employment in a globally competitive marketplace.  This will be accomplished by creating and disseminating innovative curricula and instructional materials, providing high quality professional development programs for academic and industry personnel and technical assistance services to the educational community.    Over the next three years, a major focus of Center activities will be to position NJCATE as a national provider of quality educational products and services, moving the Center toward an increasing level of self-sufficiency.  Working with a business consultant, NJCATE staff analyzed potential markets for NJCATE products and services, identified and described products and services, and developed a series of strategies to move NJCATE forward.  The activities outlined in this proposal result from planning effort.",
