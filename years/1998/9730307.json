 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730307  Bjork    \"BioLogica\" (TM) is a Java-platform, computer-based manipulative that enables students to explore a variety of different genetic phenomena building their own knowledge through direct observation and manipulation.  As the successor to GenScope, it allows high school and middle school students to conduct real experiments in a virtual environment through the observation and study of Mandolin genetics in real or imaginary organisms at six different levels: DNA, chromosome, cell, organism, pedigree, and population.  This project develops scripted software called interactivities that applies the BioLogica engine to different organisms.  These interactivities can be customized to treatments in specific texts and provide alternative learning consistent with wet labs and other hands-on activities.  The project integrates software with biology curricula to produce materials that allow teachers to introduce the software into their practice and students to reap the benefits of using complementary ways to learn.  Teachers can use the scripts to develop their own materials or use them in conjunction with proven texts.  The materials also provide teachers logs of student work and embedded assessments.  The new materials are developed with the input from teachers and tested in schools.  An extensive evaluation provides data on student learning.",
