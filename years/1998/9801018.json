 "awd_abstract_narration": "9801018\r\nMcMahon\r\nThis proposal is on research which would use broad comparisons and analytical methods from continuum mechanics to identify the best design strategy for a fall-safe floor pad to prevent hip fracture.  The goal is a pad system to be laid over existing floors that behaves like a conventional hard floor for ordinary walking, but collapses locally beneath a bony prominence upon impact.  Three alternative design strategies will be investigated.  These strategies include the investigation of: (1) rigid and elastic foams, (2) rigid and elastic honeycombs, and (3) a new concept introduced in this research called \"GranulAir\".  The GranulAir concept features a top layer of granular material under compression, supported on an inflated bag containing baffles acting as tensile elements.  The goal of all three designs is to have an extremely nonlinear force-deflection curve, with a very steep slope for low stresses and a pronounced yield at a controllable applied stress.  Methods for comparing performance among the design alternatives include finite-element analysis for simulated impacts, testing of granular materials in direct shear, and testing of prototypes using both a servohydrolic tester for quasistatic measurements and a specialized impact tester (surrogate pelvis) for dynamic measurements.  In addition, the practical and economic aspects and an educational component are part of the proposal.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
