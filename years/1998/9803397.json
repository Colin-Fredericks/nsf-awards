 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI intends to continue his study of uniqueness and stability for certain \r\nimportant inverse problems. The contemporary methods of the theory of \r\npartial differential equations will be used. Those include Carleman type \r\nestimates, the Fourier integral operators, potential theory, and general \r\nfunctional analytic approach. An emphasis is on inverse problems with \r\nlocal/partial boundary measurements, on increasing stability by isolating \r\nill-posedness in a simple linear transform, on recovery of non-linear \r\nequations, and on interaction between inverse problems and optimal \r\ncontrol theory. Based on the theory the PI plans to develop efficient \r\nnumerical algorithms for the following important applied inverse \r\nproblems.\r\n      The applied focus of the project will be on \r\n-     the problem of electromagnetic detection of the active part of human \r\nbrain\r\n-     identifying a source of acoustical noise located on the surface of an \r\naircraft cabin from interior measurements\r\n-     finding constitutive laws for complicated non-linear physical systems, \r\nincluding underground flows in porous media and chemical reactions\r\n-     reconstruction of the volatility coefficient of options trading from \r\ncurrent market data.\r\nThe second problem is of immediate importance in designing less noisy \r\ncars and midsize aircraft. The fourth one is about prediction of the future \r\nstate of the very important financial area influencing the life of \r\ncontemporary society.\r\n",
