 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Visiting Professorship award at the California Institute of\r\nTechnology will allow the investigator to broaden and strengthen\r\nher research.\r\nResearch will be conducted in two areas of mathematics, combinatorics\r\nand cryptography. Both of these fields are interdisciplinary and\r\nfall in the intersection of mathematics and computer science.\r\nThey have important applications in Information Theory.\r\nThe research projects in combinatorics are on existence problems\r\nin combinatorial design theory and applications of decompositions of\r\nedge-colored complete graphs in design theory. The emphasis is\r\non explicit constructions using both recursive and direct, efficient\r\ncomputational methods. Applications of combinatorial designs can be\r\nfound in cryptography, scheduling, coding theory, statistics,\r\ncomputer science, and molecular biology.\r\nThe projects in cryptography are of two types. The first is research\r\nin the intersection of combinatorics and cryptography: an investigation\r\nof combinatorial constructions for authentication schemes and of\r\ndesigns which provide important cryptographic properties.  The second\r\nis to expand and broaden the investigator's research in cryptography.\r\nAreas of particular interest for research include applications of\r\nfinite field theory, finite geometry, and other combinatorial\r\nconstructions used for public key cryptography.\r\nAn extended visit to the new Center for Applied Cryptographic Research\r\nat the University of Waterloo will provide a unique opportunity for\r\ncollaboration and research in cryptography.  This POWRE project is jointly supported by the MPS\r\n     Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of Mathematical\r\n     Sciences (DMS). \r\n",
