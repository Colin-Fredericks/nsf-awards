 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research(SBIR) Phase II project describes development of a new method for the in situ formation of impermeable and/or reactive barriers in soil for potential applications in environmental cleanup technologies and geophysical engineering. The placement of such barriers in soil as well as the formation of horizontal or vertical impermeable barriers is performed by pressure injection, which is limited by short grout permeation distances and shallow injection depth.  The proposed method was successfully tested in Phase I for the formation of reactive, permeable zero-valent iron barriers and impermeable cementitious barriers. It provides an easy control of soil conditions as well as a distribution of the reagents to control the barrier permeability through gelling and/or polymerization. It can be applied in saturated soils of low or high hydraulic permeability where injection grouting is not efficient. Phase II will focus on the optimization of the parameters governing the process of controlled transport of colloidal particles        through the soil and on-the-field demonstration of the formation of both the impermeable and reactive barriers in soil.  Initial markets for the impermeable barriers will include repair and maintenance of clay liners in leaking landfills, soil containment, consolidation and improvement in under-water-constructions and construction below the buildings. Reactive walls, consisting of zero-valent iron or microorganisms prepared by the proposed method will find applications in treatment of polluted groundwater and soil at both industrial and military sites. The EPA estimates the use of in situ formation of `reactive walls` in which chlorinated solvents are converted from toxic to benign substances in situ, could save $ 1 billion in cleanup of contaminated sites.",
