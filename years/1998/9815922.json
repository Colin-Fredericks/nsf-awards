 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support several areas of global change  research in the Caribbean.  An existing precipitation data  base for the Caribbean will be expanded.  This precipitation  data set currently consists of monthly average station data,  and was compiled from the Climate Prediction Center CAMS  station precipitation data for January 1851 through  September 1994 and CDIAC Global Historical Climatology  Network data base for precipitation for October 1832 through  October 1990, with duplicate data ignored. Precipitation  data and other data will be augmented by the use of NCEP and  ECMWF re-analysis data and TRMM data if available.  CDIAC  monthly temperature, sea level pressure and station pressure  data will be added. SST data will also be incorporated by  using the GISST 2.3 data set from the Hadley Centre.  Other  data sets, including upper air data and soil moisture, from  relevant world-wide and Caribbean institutes, including the  Caribbean Meteorological Institute (CMI), which have been  checked for quality control will also be incorporated.  The  combined data set will be gridded using an area weighting  average in the GrADS R40 format.  A preliminary version of  this data set has already been used for analyses, but the  full version will be checked for validity over the ocean by  comparing it with the Xie-Arkin data which has a shorter  time span (1997 onward), but includes observed data over the  ocean.  Satellite imagery and data will be obtained from the  University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez (UPRM). The regional  climate model MM5, in collaboration with the Department of  Meteorology, University of Maryland, will be used to study  climate variability in the Caribbean.  The University of the  West Indies has created a 2 year post in Climate Modeling  for this purpose, and a student presently completing his  Ph.D. at the University of Maryland will return to continue  the work of the climate modeling at the end of 2 years.  The  project will provide part of the backbone for a data and  information system for the exchange of global change data  resulting from IAI-sponsored research between members of  research teams in the Americas, including the USA and  Canada.  This project will specifically give US researchers  access to data sets from the rest of the Americas that have  previously been inaccessible.  The National Science  Foundation is the designated U.S. Government agency to carry  out U.S. responsibilities within the IAI.",
