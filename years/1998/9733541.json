 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basic research component of this project is concerned  with transient faults and unexpected environmental changes  that occur in distributed systems and networks.  Transient  faults include spontaneous data corruption and any temporary  deviation from software specification. The project explores  how effects of transient faults can be contained within  desired boundaries of time or application-specific  objectives. Using methods of stabilizing algorithms, which  automatically recover from transient state disruptions,  issues of containment will be studied. Basic research  investigations will yield new algorithms for tolerating  transient faults and will demonstrate the inherent resource  conflicts between stabilization and containment objectives.  Another goal is to alleviate compute-intensive and  complexity disadvantages often associated with stabilizing  algorithms, using methods of encapsulation and probabilistic  approaches.  The potential significance of the new  stabilizing containment techniques will be demonstrated by  case studies: interfaces between software layers that  contain effects of faults are simplified; optimistic  treatment of faults improves efficiency of recovery;  distributed programs can manipulate objects while limiting  contamination due to temporary object corruption.  The  impact of the basic research and its case studies will be to  bring stabilization and containment techniques closer to  widespread application in new generations of distributed  systems.  The plan's applied research and educational  components emphasize student projects implementing recent  distributed computing algorithms.",
