 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803249  Pemantle   The PI will study several problems on the interface between probability theory and   discrete mathematics.  One of these problems is essentially combinatorial, having to do   with enumeration of lattice paths and with solving a class of recursions arising in this   problem. The problem arose from an application in computer science, but the applications   of this combinatorial analysis extend to particle systems, and to many other enumeration   problems. The second research area is the theory of random processes on countable   groups.  Many basic processes such as percolation, random walk, and Markov random   fields are symmetric with respect to the action of some group.  When the geometry of the   space is hyperbolic, the group is typically non-amenable, and the symmetry of the process   under the action of such a large group forces the process to be at least somewhat well   behaved.  The PI will attempt to exploit some recently developed mass transport methods   to obtain such results. Finally, he will continue research into random processes on trees,   and in particular, the examination of the rotor model, the contact process, branching   random walk, and invasion percolation.   Often quantities of mathematical and physical interest are encoded in a power   series, which is a very powerful tool for obtaining expressions for the quantities of   interest, provided one can in the end decode the information.  It is known how to do this   for power series in one variable, but relatively little is known when there is more than one   variable.  Even a reasonable approximation is in general unknown.  The results from this   research are expected to include a reliable method for approximating the coefficients of   power series in more than one variable. This will then allow approximate solutions to   problems that range from path enumeration, to queuing problems (computing efficiency of   networks of production), to analysis of the speed of algorithms (the original motivation for    this project).",
