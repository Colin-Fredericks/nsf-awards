 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Proteins are aptly referred to as nature's building blocks.  Understanding how these proteins function is key to  understanding life's processes.  On the other hand,  understanding why these proteins do not function, or function  incorrectly, tells us much about particular diseases and  illnesses.  Therefore, it is not surprising that the amount of  experimental data available on proteins, like most other  biological data, are growing exponentially as we attempt to  unravel these mysteries.  Effective use of these data requires  usable and current databases.  Most public databases contain  only one form of data, either sequences, structure, and to a  lesser extent functional information, on a large variety of  loosely classified proteins.  While these resources are  clearly very useful, other types of resources are needed that  are publicly available yet can be maintained at very low cost.  This project encompasses the development of one such database  that will contain an automated classification of proteins  based on an extensive set of properties more properties than  considered by any other resource.  The Database of Classified  Proteins (DCP) is a generalization of previous work for  supporting information specifically on the protein kinase  family of enzymes (see http://www. sdsc.edu/kinases).  The DCP  will contain an extensive set of physical and derived  properties (a composite property description) including  sequence, structure, evolutionary information (e.g.,  correlated mutations) and functional sites (initially derived  from structure but later predicted from the composite  description).  New protein structures deposited with the PDB  will be, where possible, aligned to an existing composite  property description defining a protein family.  The outcome  of this work will be an all-by-all comparison of proteins for  which structures are known derived using the compute resources  of the National Partnership for Advanced Computational  Infrastructure (NPACI).  That comparison wil l be publicly  available as the DCP and maintained on a 7/24 basis.  The DCP  will provide new opportunities for comparing proteins and  visualization tools are pro-posed to make this possible  through the Web.  The DCP should provide new insights into  protein function by revealing hitherto undiscovered functional  sites.  Furthers the DCP should be useful as a fold  recognition database for use in threading sequences with  unknown structure on to known folds.  The DCP will contain  much more information than could hitherto be applied to the  structure prediction problem.  ***",
