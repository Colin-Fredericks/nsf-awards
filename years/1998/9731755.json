 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on the free radical oxidation of organic compounds.     Isotopically-labelled hydroperoxides will be used to detail the   mechanism of the radical oxidations of biologically relevant media such   as micelles, lipid bilayers and lipoproteins.   Chiral metal complexes   capable of acting as Lewis acids will be bound to appropriately   functionalized alkenes and used in a novel manner to impose   enantioselectivity on the radical reactions.   Lastly, new free radical   copolymerization procedures will be examined as a route to   stoichiometrically well-defined alternating copolymers.   Graduate and   postdoctoral students will be introduced to the synthesis and   characterization of isotopically-labelled compounds, and the use of these   and other specifically designed reagents as mechanistic probes of the   reactions.  With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports the research and educational activities of  Dr. Ned Porter of   Duke University.  Professor Porter will focus his research on garnering   fundamental information on free-radical oxidations.  Although known for   some time, recognition of the role of organic free radicals in different   biochemical processes, as well as their increasing applications in   organic and material syntheses creates the need to elucidate the   chemistry of these reactive intermediates.  This research utilizes unique   isotopically-labelled molecules to probe the mechanisms of free radical   oxidations of organic substrates, and novel organometallic adducts to   examine an innovative approach to imposing stereochemical control on the   reactions.   Professor Porter's educational activities involve the   training of graduate and postdoctoral students.                                                    u\u00ac",
