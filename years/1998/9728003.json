 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728003  BENSON     The long term goal of this research is to  understand how the axons of neurons are guided to particular parts  of their target cells, and once there, how they assemble synaptic  contacts.  Several classes of adhesion molecules, such as  cadherins, integrins and members of the immunoglobulin superfamily  are known to generate junctions between cells, and recent research  has shown that these same molecules are also localized at synaptic  junctions in the central nervous system (CNS).  These new data  strongly suggest that the mechanisms by which pre- and  postsynaptic membranes adhere to one another in the CNS may be  substantially similar to those that generate intercellular  adhesion in other, non-neural tissues.  Consistent with this  hypothesis is the following evidence:  Immunolocalization of N-  and E-cadherin at synaptic junctions; the tight adhesive nature of  cadherins and their resultant intermembrane distances correlate  well with biochemical properties and calculated intermembrane  distances described for synapses; and both synapse formation and  targeting to the appropriate cellular domain (somata, dendritic  shafts, spines) occur in the absence of neural activity.  Synapse  development and organization are well-characterized in the rat  hippocampus and in hippocampal neurons grown in culture.  Together  they make an excellent model system in which to examine  interneuronal synapse formation and targeting.  The first aim of  Dr. Benson's research is to test the hypothesis that cadherin  incorporation is critical for synapse formation.  This will be  accomplished by examining the deposition of cadherins at synapses  in cultured hippocampal neurons in relation to other well-  characterized synaptic markers, in the presence and absence of  inhibitors and antisense oligonucleotides that block the  production of cadherins.  The second aim is to examine the  relationship between different cadherins and functionally distinct  synapses.  Co-localization of cadherins or ca tenins and  transmitter-specific synaptic markers will be assessed in vivo and  in vitro.  Together, data from these aims will be used to describe  the dynamics of cadherin localization during synapse development  and will have broad implications for the mechanisms underlying  synapse assembly in CNS.",
