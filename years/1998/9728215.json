 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728215  Stojiljkovic   Biosynthesis of heme in bacteria requires a significant amount of cell energy and uses 1 to 10% of the total cell iron content. The high energy costs of heme biosynthesis coupled with the constant famine which bacteria face in their natural environments has favored the development of heme scavenging systems. Gram-negative bacteria express heme-specific outer membrane receptors that allow usage of heme compounds as sources of iron and porphyrin. Protein domains and amino acid residues involved in binding, extraction, and transport of heme by any heme receptor are currently unknown. The Y. enterocolitica HemR receptor will be studied as the model of a heme-specific outer membrane receptor. HemR is unique among Gram-negative receptors since it enables usage of a wide variety of heme-protein complexes. In aim 1 of the project the role of conserved histidine residues and \"FRAP\" and \"NPNL\" boxes in HemR function will be studied by site-directed mutagenesis and epitope tagging. In aim 2 of the project the molecular basis for the extraordinarily broad spectrum of usable HemR ligands will be studied using PCR mutagenesis and toxic compounds that specifically inhibit growth of HemR+ cells. Research described under aim 3 of the project will quantify defects in ligand and TonB binding by the mutant HemR receptors and will study the mechanism by which the HemR receptor releases heme from heme-protein complexes in vitro. These studies will, for the first time for any heme receptor, identify and characterize receptor domains that are involved in binding and utilization of different heme-protein complexes and determine the mechanism by which heme receptors extract heme from different protein complexes.     The heme molecule is one of the most important enzyme cofactors in nature. Heme is an essential cofactor in oxygen transport, oxygen metabolism, and electron transfer in the majority of living beings. Because of the importance of the heme molecule, the majority of organisms have develo ped systems for heme scavenging from the environment. Although ubiquitous in nature, these systems are poorly understood. The goal of this project is to understand the mechanism of action and identify functionally important protein domains of the first bacterial heme receptor to be characterized, the HemR of Y. enterocolitica.",
