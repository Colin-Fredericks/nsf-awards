This  fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain  additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue innovative and imaginative research into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular, cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out with a sponsoring scientist.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled genetic and  molecular analysis of brassinosteroid regulation of plant  development by light.  Many developmental processes of  plants are regulated by the environmental light conditions;  and this light regulation involves the phytohormone  brassinosteroids (BR). Genes mediating the BR response are  being isolated as those that, when activated or mutated, can  complement the developmental defects caused by insufficient  synthesis of BR, such as in the det2 mutant. A putative  receptor of BR (BRI1) is a membrane bound receptor kinase.  Proteins that interact with or are phosphorylated by the  BRI1 kinase are likely to mediate the transduction of BR  signals.  These proteins are being isolated using the yeast  two-hybrid or phosphorylation cloning methods. Effects of  light treatment on the modification and activity of BRI1  protein are being analyzed to determine how BR mediates  light regulation of plant development.",
