The principal objectives of the proposed research are to refine in-situ hydrothermal experimental techniques and to establish a foundation of knowledge regarding organic synthesis reactions in subsurface hydrothermal environments - a well-recognized need and opportunity in the study of life in extreme environments (stated explicitly in Holm et al., 1992, and implicitly in National Research Council, 1990).  Toward this end, we propose to develop and apply spectroscopic methods to monitor the rates and pathways of hydrothermal organic reactions as a function of relevant variables, including pressure, temperature, pH, and H2 cells, of a type that has been designed, built, and tested at the Geophysical Laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on in-situ monitoring of high-pressure, hydrothermal organic reactions.  This work involves the application of hydrothermal pressure cells, Raman spectroscopy, and optical microscopy to assess pathways and rates of organic reactions in real time.  We propose to focus on three tasks during this project: (1) design and construction of hydrothermal diamond cells; (2) development of in situ monitoring techniques to study hydrothermal organic reactions; and (3) hydrothermal reaction studies.\r\n",
