 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Chemistry   program supports research on silica-related compounds by Dr. Frank J.   Feher, Chemistry Department, University of California-Irvine.  Synthetic   methods for three types of silsesquioxane compounds will be developed:    incompletely-condensed silsesquioxanes from fully-condensed (RSiO3/2)n   frameworks; versatile precursors to water-soluble frameworks; and   endohedral complexes.  The goal is to develop methods for preparing the   target compounds in bulk for use in catalytic reactions.   A key step in   all of these syntheses is selective partial hydrolysis of fully-condensed   frameworks to give well-defined products.  Some of the resulting   compounds will be studied as models for surface reactions thought to   occur at catalyst sites with various numbers of proximate hydroxy groups   or at sites that control stereospecificity.  Others will be used to form   `cages` that can host small molecules, thus controlling reactivity.  Large assemblies of compounds containing silicon and oxygen called   silsesquioxanes have previously been synthesized and used as models for   silica and as building blocks for other network solids.  Compounds of   this type are used as catalyst supports for transition metals and as   catalysts in important industrial processes.  In this research, new   compounds in this family will be prepared in order to extend the   usefulness of this inexpensive class of materials.",
