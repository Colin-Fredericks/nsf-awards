One component employs the controlled  introduction of structural defects to modify the phase diagram  and vortex behavior of the superconducting heavy fermion system  (U,Th)Be13. This system exhibits multiple superconducting phases,  as well as magnetism, and should provide clues to understanding  other unconventional superconductors, such as the high-Tc  superconductors. Columnar defects will be created through heavy-  ion irradiation, and point defects through both irradiation and  substitution. Low-temperature thermodynamic and magnetic  measurements will be used to identify the superconducting wave  function(s) of the system. The educational component involves  facilitating undergraduate research through a less technically  demanding set of experiments. These involve the study of packing  arrangements of solid objects. Vibrating a container of beads  anneals them into the densest possible arrangement in two  dimensions, but not in three dimensions. This project will  examine the dimensional crossover by varying container size and  shape, and will test different annealing  procedures to determine  the interaction of dimensionality and dynamical processes.  %%%  This a CAREER Award to a female scientist and is composed of two  subprojects. One component investigates materials known as \"heavy  fermion\" superconductors. These superconductors carry electric  current with no energy loss, like ordinary superconductors, but  in addition exhibit unusual magnetic behavior. Structural  imperfections of the atoms in the sample will be deliberately  introduced in order to modify their electrical and magnetic  properties. The resulting changes in the onset temperature of  superconductivity and the magnetic behavior of the superconductor  are expected to shed light on the atomic origins of the  superconductivity. This could lead to new superconducting  materials and a better understanding of superconductors  in  practical applications. The educational component will introduce  undergraduates to research through a less technically demanding  set of experiments. These experiments involve studies of how  objects arrange themselves in two and three dimensions. Shaking  solid objects, such as glass beads, causes them to pack in the  densest way possible if the objects are constrained to a single  layer. However, this does not occur if they are stacked in three  dimensions, as in a jar of coffee beans. To understand the  transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional behavior,  arrangements of objects only a few layers thick will be studied.  The general problem of packing is relevant to the fabrication of  new composite materials, where high density components often  impart special properties to the overall material.
