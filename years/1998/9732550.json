 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with the creation of new methods  of electronic circuit design which will allow realization of  smaller size, longer battery life and lower cost in personal  communication systems such as cellular telephones, cordless  telephones and wireless computer networks. In addition, new  transceiver architectures are being investigated which will  allow multistandard operation which is transparent to the  user. Thus, a single personal communication handset could be  used anywhere in the world as it automatically adjusts to  different local standards and frequencies. Current  implementations of portable transceivers typically use a  multi-chip, multi-technology approach with a number of  precision external filters, resonators, and other components  in order to meet the stringent performance requirement of  the analog RF interface in such systems. These transitional  approaches severely limit the achievable levels of power  dissipation and form factor, and are not compatible with low-  cost adaptive multistandard operation. This research is  exploring new architectures and circuit techniques which  will allow utilization of scaled CMOS VLSI technology to  integrate the entire transceiver function with only a few  external components. The challenge is to find new approaches  that overcome the inherent limitations of integrated passive  components such as low Q values in integrated inductors,  capacitors and varactors, by utilization of the inherently  high bandwidth capabilities of scaled integrated MOS  transistors. The investigators expect to demonstrate at the  end of this research project a single-chip multistandard RF  transceiver incorporating synthesizers, transmit path, power  amplifier, and receive path as well as providing interface  to several different RF standards. This prototype will  be implemented in 0.35 micron CMOS technology.",
