 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803520  Millson       Millson will continue to explore connections among spaces of  representations of finitely-generated groups into Lie groups, linkages  in model spaces of constant curvature, arrangements of subspaces, and  integrable Hamiltonian systems and their quantizations.  Much of this  work will be done with Michael Kapovich of the University of Utah.  Millson and Kapovich used the above relations to construct Artin  groups that were not the fundamental groups of smooth complex  algebraic varieties.  This work has just been accepted by the Publ.  Math. IHES.  Millson is also working with Hermann Flaschka of the  University of Arizona on constructing integrable systems on symplectic  quotients (by the adjoint representation) of products of orbits in  simple Lie algebras.  They have recently found such systems for  minimal orbits.  A critical role is played by the Aronszajn-Weinstein  formula of perturbation theory.  Their end goal is to give new insight  into the work of Lusztig and others on decomposing tensor products of  irreducible representations.       Millson's work begins with one of the first theorems of  high-school geometry -- the theorem that if two triangles have the  same set of side lengths then they are congruent.  The analogue for  quadrilaterals is clearly false: one can change a square into a  rhombus without changing the side lengths.  So one is led to try to  parametrize the set of all planar n-gons with the same side lengths.  From there one is led to a favorite theme of nineteenth century  mathematics, the study of planar linkages (systems of rods and  hinges).  In the nineteenth century such a study was of immense  practical significance -- the problem was to convert linear motion (of  a piston rod) to circular motion (turning of a wheel) by a linkage.  The problem was solved by a French naval officer, Peaucellier.  It  turns out that from the modern point of view the nineteenth century  work is insufficiently precise.  Millson and Kapovich have corrected  the  errors and written up a proof of a result (often attributed to  Thurston) that given any smooth manifold M, there is a planar linkage  whose configuration space is diffeomorphic to a disjoint union of a  number of copies of M.  The above work on planar linkages led to a  study of n-gon linkages in space.  This theory is enormously richer,  connecting with symplectic geometry, integrable Hamiltonian systems,  and representation theory.  The analogous theory in spherical and  hyperbolic three-space appears to connect up with some of the newest  objects in geometry and algebra, Poisson Lie groups and quantum  groups.  ***",
