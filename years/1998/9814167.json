 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to examine the evolutionary significance of  gamete traits that influence fertilization success in free-spawning marine  organisms.  Basic research in this field is crucial for understanding the  reproductive ecology of harvested invertebrates, for aquaculture and for  conservation biological reasons.   Recent work on the fertilization ecology  of free-spawners has raised diverse questions regarding character evolution  at the gamete stage of the life cycle. Theory and empirical studies suggest  that the size of eggs and egg coats, the density of sperm receptor sites,  the speed and longevity of sperm, and the action of sperm-activating  compounds released by eggs can each influence fertilization success by  affecting rates of sperm-egg contact. These studies, however, have not  resolved whether particular traits are a product of selection on  fertilization success, and whether such traits appear to co-evolve as a  result of their functional interactions.       This project will involve a set of at least 9 sympatric species of  marine brittlestars in the genus Macrophiothrix (Echinodermata:  Ophiuroidea) from coral reef ecosystems. This group includes at least  40-fold variation in egg volume and provides an ideal comparative system  for assessing the importance of size and other gamete attributes in  sperm-egg collision.  Interest in this genus is especially motivated by our  discovery of an unusual degree of species-specificity in sperm chemotaxis,  which offers a unique opportunity to examine the role of sperm chemotaxis  in promoting reproductive isolation. The research will integrate  phylogenetic information, tests of fertilization performance, and measures  of gamete attributes to address fundamental questions about the evolution  and co-evolution of gamete traits. In order to test hypotheses about gamete  function in a phylogenetic context, this study has the following four  objectives: OBJECTIVE 1: To construct a phylogeny for the study species  using molecular markers. Phylogenetic information is needed to establish  historical patterns of character change, as well as to control for  correlation among traits due to common ancestry. OBJECTIVE 2: To examine  the importance of egg size and other physical gamete attributes in  fertilization. In vitro fertilization assays and variation in gamete traits  will be used to test the hypothesis that egg target size and sperm swimming  speed contribute to interspecific variation in fertilization success.  OBJECTIVE 3: To examine the role of spermegg chemical attraction in  promoting reproductive isolation.  OBJECTIVE 4: To test hypotheses  concerning patterns of covariance among gamete traits. Phylogenetic  information will be used to test hypotheses of coevolution where theory  predicts functional interactions between pairs of traits: ovum size and  jelly coat size; egg target size and sperm speed; sperm speed and  longevity; egg target size and the strength of sperm chemotaxis.       This research is designed to fill critical gaps in our understanding  of fertilization ecology and the evolution of gamete characters. This will  be a comprehensive study in a phylogenetic context of both physical and  chemical traits that can influence rates of gamete contact . By using  phylogenetic information for a closely-related group of ecologically  similar organisms, this research explicitly tests evolutionary hypotheses  about functional relationships among such traits. Furthermore, the unique  pattern of sperm chemotaxis in this system provides an opportunity to  examine the role of pre-contact chemical specificity in promoting the  reproductive isolation of synchronously-spawning species. Because  free-spawning is the dominant and likely ancestral mode of fertilization,  results from this project will have widespread relevance to the evolution  of reproductive systems in marine environments.",
