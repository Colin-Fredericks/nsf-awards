The common theme is to study this\r\ntheory in connection with number theory, geometry and ergodic theory.  One of\r\nthe main objectives is to continue the program of establishing a homogeneous\r\nspace approach as a powerful tool in number theory and, in particular, in the\r\ntheory of Diophantine approximations.  It is also proposed to study a variety of\r\nquestions about actions of Lie groups and their discrete subgroups on\r\nhomogeneous spaces, manifolds and general metric spaces.  In particular the\r\nprincipal investigator plans to continue his joint work with other\r\nmathematicians on properly discontinuous groups of affine transformations and on\r\nlocal rigidity for standard algebraic actions.  The technique of Lie group\r\ntheory, reduction theory, ergodic theory and the theory of dynamical systems\r\nwill be used throughout the proposed work.\r\n\r\nThe theory of Lie groups and their discrete subgroups is one of the central\r\nfields in mathematics.  Historically this theory was mostly motivated by its\r\nconnections with geometry, mechanics and the theory of differential equations. \r\nDuring the last 15-20 years it was realized that some aspects of the theory can\r\nbe applied to solve certain problems in number theory and related topics, which\r\ncould not be tackled by other methods for several decades.  It is suggested in\r\nthe proposal to continue this development in order to obtain new applications in\r\nnumber theory,  dynamical systems and geometry.  In general, the proposal should\r\nestablish new connections between discrete and continuous in mathematics.\r\n",
