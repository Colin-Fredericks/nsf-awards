University of Miami  Title: Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana: High-Resolution Paleoclimatology and  Seismic Reflection Site Survey    Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana, is an important and unique resource for  paleoenvironmental research.  The value of the Lake Bosumtwi  sediments has been demonstrated for reconstructing centennial to  millennial-scale variations of the West African monsoon.   Lamination counts and radiometric data prove that the last 1000  years of the Bosumtwi sediment record is annually-laminated  (varved), and thus ideal for reconstructing and understanding  interannual to centennial-scale climate variability in a vast area  of Africa continuing no other such record.  This award supports a  project to carry out the field and laboratory work needed to  produce the first annually-laminated continuous record of the West  African Monsoon and Sahel drought extending back centuries and  perhaps millennia.  This record will be used to test relationships  between North Atlantic variability and West African rainfall that  have been hypothesized using the short instrumental record alone.  Because of its unique location, climate sensitivity and  paleoenvironmental potential, Lake Bosumtwi has been identified by  the international paleoenvironmental community (i.e., IGBP-PAGES   Past Global Changes  and ICDP  International Continental Drilling  Programme ) as a high priority for scientific drilling.  This  project will conduct the detailed high-resolution single-channel  and intermediate-resolution seismic reflection survey needed to  plan a scientifically-optimal and safe drilling program.",
