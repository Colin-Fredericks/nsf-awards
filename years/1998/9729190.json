 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT    Proposal Number:  CTS-9729190    Principal Investigator:  Lichter      This is a grant to explore simple models of the interaction of a vortex monopole with a wall-bounded shear layer at high Reynolds number, Re.  While boundary layer theory treats layers which are thin compared to the distance to the vortex, the model proposed here considers the physically more realistic problem of a vortex which is in close proximity to, or within, the boundary layer.  This work utilizes analytical models and efficient vorticity based numerical methods which have been developed previously.    Many industrial processes rely on vortex enhanced mixing of mass, heat or momentum between boundary layers and the bulk flow.  In other types of processes, vortices degrade performance and so their presence is discouraged.  The active control of transition relies on detection of vortices and their characterization in terms of their disruptive yield.  In spite of the numerous applications,  fundamental questions remain on how vortices and boundary layers interact such as: the role of vortices in initiating disturbances, the extent that the thickening of a separating boundary layer alters the trajectory of the vortex, the accuracy and range of applicability of non-interacting boundary layer methods,  the trajectories of vortices when near boundaries or within boundary layers and  the role of vortices in entraining fluid into the boundary layer and in ejection of boundary layer vorticity.    Because of the complexities of the issues involved there is a need, then, to simplify the governing equations while identifying and retaining the dominant mechanisms by which a vortex interacts with a boundary layer.  The model considered  here avoids the singularity present in boundary layer models and can describe boundary layer evolution to long times.  The model is accurate at  high Re and so complements methods whose accuracy is limited to low or moderate Re.  Furthermore, it considers the compact disturbance produced  by a vortex and so is an adjunct to methods which consider boundary layer receptivity to wave-like disturbances.    1      1",
