 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research will extend the conceptual framework by which scholars seek to understand the complex interplay between disturbance regime and environmental gradients in structuring vegetation patterns.  The study will be conducted on the barrier islands of the southeastern US Atlantic coast in order to assess the relative contributions of two processes in structuring dune vegetation:  (1) transverse environmental gradients that shape cross-island zonation patterns, and (2) disturbance-related patch dynamics initiated by mechanical actions such as those associated with overwash during coastal storms.  The latter are thought to interrupt the former, thereby creating the potential for more complex and diverse plant assemblages.  Several specific hypotheses will be tested on the basis of information collected during extensive field campaigns.  Results will inform both the ecological dynamics literature as well as providing valuable management information for those seeking to protect, restore, and develop coastal systems.",
