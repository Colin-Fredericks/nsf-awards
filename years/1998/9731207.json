 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award is for the support of cooperative research by Dr. Alice Smith, Department of Industrial Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, and Dr. Berna Dengiz, Department of Industrial Engineering at Gazi University in Ankara, Turkey.  The project has two separate objectives: to use methods from computational intelligence, namely neural networks and genetic algorithms, to improve the design of data and voice communications network topologies when considering reliability; and to utilize the collaboration of the US and Turkish scientists (both are women) to study the issue of women participation in engineering in Turkey, and a comparison with their participation in engineering in the United States.  Scope:  This award allows cooperation of two scientists with complementary capabilities, to do important scientific work that has applications in the communications industry, in the US and in Turkey.  They will also address a subject that is important to careers of women in engineering in the United States.  The project will provide an international experience to one graduate student and one undergraduate student from the University of Pittsburgh, by conducting research at Gazi University in Ankara.  The project fits well within the objectives of the Division of International Programs.  This award includes funding from the Division of Engineering Education and Centers.",
