A combination  of techniques will be used to study these systems including  exact solutions and simulations on discrete lattice models,  as well as analytic techniques on continuum field theories.  These systems are relevant to such diverse applications as  surface/crystal growth, intercalation, granular materials,  fracture dynamics, gel electrophoresis, diffusion in complex  environments, traffic flow, etc.    The first part of this grant will focus on collective  behavior in driven diffusive lattice gases.  While the  simplest models are reasonably well understood, many of  their generalizations, e.g., skew boundary conditions,  anisotropic interactions, extreme aspect ratios or charge  asymmetries, present unanticipated challenges.  The second  part will focus on new directions.  These include random  walks in a dynamic background; the study of histograms (full  distributions) of various observables and the formulation of  systematic Grassmannian field theories for systems with  strict volume constraints; and, finally, fundamental issues  in the statistical mechanics of non-equilibrium steady  states.  %%%  This is a renewal grant to two researchers to continue their  program on driven diffusive systems: complex behavior of  interacting many-particle systems which are driven into  steady states far from thermal equilibrium.
