 "awd_abstract_narration": "Design requirements for high-value products and processes by chemical engineers have shifted recently from the large-scale requirements of traditional industries to a much finer scale characteristic of today's high-tech commodities. The current chemical engineering curriculum is not adequately preparing students to face the emerging challenges accompanying this shift in scale. There is currently little linkage in the chemical engineering curriculum between the molecular concepts taught in lower division chemistry courses and the macroscopic processes taught in the upper-division engineering curriculum. Introduction of important molecular simulation concepts into the  undergraduate curriculum is important to meet design demands of emerging technologies, but it is hampered by an already full curriculum and a lack of teaching resources and undergraduate faculty familiar with molecular concepts.  As a major step toward remedying these curriculum deficiencies and incongruities, we propose the development of 24 World-Wide-Web modules that would facilitate introduction of molecular simulation into the chemical engineering undergraduate curriculum. These teaching modules will be integrated directly into the chemical engineering core undergraduate courses, supplying for the instructor and the student the appropriate linkage material between macroscopic concepts and the molecular simulations. Because the modules are web-based, they can be easily distributed, can provide direct links to other related materials and topics, and can be readily used by students and faculty alike. They will provide visual simulations illustrating key concepts in the core undergraduate courses and they will be self-contained with instructor materials, fundamental instruction, a tutorial, computer simulations, student problems, and assessment materials. Because of their capability for visual and exploratory learning, the modules are designed to provide learning experiences for students with a variety of learning styles  Harb et  al. 1993 .   This project is a multi-institutional endeavor involving eleven chemical engineering faculty from nine different institutions. The goals of the project are endorsed and support by CACHE corporation, a non-profit organization that promotes cooperation among universities, industry, and government to develop and distribute computer-related educational materials for the chemical engineering profession.",
