 "awd_abstract_narration": "Action-WISE Program for Encouraging Women and Girls in  Science, Engineering, and Mathematics---Muskingum Area  Technical College, Muskingum College, Zanesville (Ohio) City  School District, and the Wilds, an international wildlife  research and conservation center, will collaborate in an  intensive and comprehensive SEM intervention program for  sixth through twelfth grade females.  This four-partner  project is an expansion of a pilot project begun two years  ago in one of the district's middle schools.    Project objectives include (1) expanding the numbers and  grade levels of students involved from seventh and eight  grade participants in one middle school to sixth through  twelfth grade participants district-wide, (2) strengthening  the curriculum and expanding the project calendar, and (3)  developing a strong web of support for young women with an  interest in science, engineering, and mathematics.  Activities will encompass the school year and extend into  separate, intensive summer camp sessions for each grade  level.  Key offerings of the project are monthly seminars  and informal  discussions with women in SEM-related  professions, field trips involving hands-on learning  activities, academic instruction in a variety of scientific  disciplines, and a mentorship program with females in SEM-  related professions.    The project will serve approximately 280 female students  annually.  Each grade level component will be progressively  more personalized.  Because few of the district's students  have had any exposure to college, every field activity will  be tied to a college visit.  Student participants will  represent a diverse range of academic ability and economic,  ethnic, and racial backgrounds.    Summer components will focus on environmental science  activities which will involve biology, chemistry, physics,  geology, and math.  Science, math, and computer laboratories  at both colleges, regional field sites, and the diverse  habitats found at the Wilds will provide exceptional  sc ientific exploration opportunities.  Female undergraduate  science majors at both college will serve as laboratory  assistants and mentors to middle school and high school  participants.  A graduate course will be presented annually  to district teachers and administrative personnel to educate  them about gender equity issues concerning women and girls  in science.    At a recognition ceremony each spring and at the end of each  of the summer sessions, student participants will report on  program activities, introduce video clips of field  experience and seminars, and present individual and group  projects.  Expected project outcomes include removing  artificial barriers that affect females entering SEM field,  increasing the number of  females continuing science  education, and building a solid and sound program which can  be replicated in other school districts.",
