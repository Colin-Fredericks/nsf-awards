 "awd_abstract_narration": "9871475  Cladis    The purpose of this award is to provide partial support to a  Special Symposium of the 28th Annual Meeting of the Fine Particle  Society to be held in Dallas, TX, April 1-3, 1998.  The invited  scientists have recently been credited with several breakthroughs  in advancing our fundamental knowledge of, therefore awareness of  potential applications for, liquid crystalline polymers and  elastomers.  At the Special Symposium, they willl share their  knowledge and perspectives of these highly novel materials, first  successfully synthesized and studied in Europe, with US  scientists particularly interested in their biomedical  applications.  %%%  Liquid Crystalline polymers come in two groups, those where the  liquid crystalline elements are linked on a linear chain and  those where they hang as side groups from polymer chains.  The  first are known as main-chain liquid crystalline polymers and the  second as side-chain liquid crystalline polymers.  While there is  US based expertise on main chain liquid crystalline polymers,  there is far less for side-chain liquid crystalline polymers and  elastomers.  Awareness of the range of applications for side-  chain liquid crystalline polymers and elastomers was recently  dramatically broadened by theoretical studies showing they could  have novel applications as artificial muscles.  Because know-how  has been developed in Europe to prepare liquid single crystalline  elastomers and polymers, such important theoretical conclusions  can be supported by experiments and materials characterizations.  As a result, applications, particularly in the biomedical domain,  based on these novel materials is ripe for further development in  biomedical engineering.  ***",
