 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Congress of Neuroethology has met at three-year intervals since 1986, to bring together researchers working on the neural basis of behavior in vertebrate and invertebrate animals.  The huge range of behaviors shown by many sorts of animals is a challenge to explain, and this diversity also can be used to illuminate basic principles of the organization and design of brains in general.  It is productive, for example, to study a specialist in a particular kind of behavior such as bat echolocation, or a relatively simple system such as leech swimming, because detailed comparisons of the networks of nerve cells in brains often reveal unexpected mechanisms that need to be incorporated in our thinking about the complexity of brain function.   The conference format is designed to emphasize talks on behavioral specializations, and on comparing common neural mechanisms across animals, with other talks on technical advances such as optical imaging and computational techniques for studying brain function.  This award will provide partial support for student travel to the meeting.\r\n   This meeting will have an impact across neuroscience, from cellular approaches to behavior, and will also foster the careers of young investigators, and so have an impact on the infrastructure of neuroscience.\r\n",
