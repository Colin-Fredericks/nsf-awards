 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new approach to political self-identification is advanced in this research and its predictions concerning the origins of feminist identity are examined.  From this new perspective, political identification is viewed as a social identity and the way in which its supporters and opponents are portrayed is considered central to its development.  Three major hypotheses concerning the origins of political identity are examined.  (1) A salient group label is crucial to the establishment, strengthening, and transformation of political identity.  (2) The political and personal attributes of typical group members (group prototype) and one's similarity (political and personal) to them is the basis for identity formation and development.  (3) The existence of a political opposition sharpens group boundaries and strengthens an existing political identity; dissimilarity from an opposition further promotes the development of political identity by defining what the political group is not.  These predictions are tested in a series of experimental studies with participants from Long Island, New York.  Participants read an experimentally altered news story embedded in a longer questionnaire in which the portrayal of feminists is systematically varied.  By exploring the origins of political identity in the portrayal of an ideology's adherents and detractors, the project will: (1) advance theoretical thinking on the origins of political self-identification; (2) identify the factors that contribute to the formation and development of political identity over time; (3) provide an explanation for the gap between political identification and support for related political beliefs that is not adequately explained by current theoretical approaches; (4) highlight the role played by the media in defining political identification as social identity; and (5) lend insight into the factors that lead to the formation and development of social identities more generally in an organizational, interethnic, or political setting for groups with a prior history and a previously established prototype.  Consistent with the goals of the POWRE program, this project will advance the investigators current research agenda and enhance and broaden her reputation as a scholar of political behavior, gender and politics, and political communications.  The current study will allow the investigator to advance her research in a new direction in the area of political self-identification.",
