 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research project is to develop an  integrated compiler and run-time system for global data  distribution.  The goal is for the integrated system to  execute large-scale, multi-phase parallel scientific  applications more efficiently than can be done with static  analysis alone. First, compiler analysis will be developed  to divide a program into its component phases as well as  pass useful hints to the run-time system about intra-phase  behavior, such as the communication pattern.  Second, the  necessary run-time analysis will be developed to support  multi-phase applications and to make use of the compiler  information.  A framework will be investigated to determine  at run time an efficient global data distribution over a  reasonable set of possible distributions.  This means that a  distribution will be determined for each array in each  program phase, with possible redistribution between phases,  that results in good application performance. Furthermore,  if application characteristics change during execution, the  distribution will be changed accordingly.  The integrated  system will be measured on a variety of large-scale,  adaptive parallel scientific programs.",
