 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802493\r\nKuhn\r\n     Professor Kuhn has a long record of developing both homotopy- \r\ntheoretic and representation-theoretic methods to solve problems in  \r\nboth areas.  More recently, some of these methods have led him also  \r\nin algebraic K-theoretic directions, and his research and techniques  \r\nare being used extensively by others.  The largest part of this  \r\nproject is directed towards connecting classic loopspace theory with  \r\nthe more recent developments of `S-module' and `Goodwillie calculus'  \r\ntechnology, with the focus of these efforts aimed towards  \r\nestablishing new conjectures concerning well known and much studied  \r\ntopological objects: Eilenberg-MacLane spaces, Hopf invariants, and  \r\ncombinatorial function space models.  A second part of the work is  \r\npart of the rapid development being made now in algebraic K-theory  \r\nand generic representation theory over finite fields by Professor  \r\nKuhn, K-theorists Eric Friedlander and Andrei Suslin, and their  \r\ncollaborators.  Finally, Professor Kuhn and his students are  \r\ncontinuing work on topological realization problems, using both new  \r\nhomotopy theoretic and algebraic techniques, following the direction  \r\nof earlier work by Professor Kuhn and Lionel Schwartz of Paris.\r\n     Homotopy theory, K-theory, and representation theory are\r\nmathematical subjects in which one is trying to discover, and\r\nultimately classify, fundamental ``building blocks'' of various sorts\r\nof mathematical structure.  (This is quite analogous to a chemist's\r\nstudying simple molecular configurations, and how these can be\r\nassembled in more complex ways.)  Homotopy is concerned with\r\ndeformations of geometric objects such as higher dimensional surfaces.\r\nRepresentation theory is concerned with the algebraic symmetries of\r\nmore rigid and discrete objects such as configurations of lines and\r\nplanes.   Finally K-theory is a hybrid of the two.  Professor Kuhn is\r\nstudying intriguing new connections relating these subjects, using a\r\nvariety of state-of-the-art algebraic and homotopy theoretic tools,\r\nmany developed by himself.\r\n***\r\n",
