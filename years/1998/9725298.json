 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, provided by the Office of Polar Programs of the  National Science Foundation, supports research to continue  isotopic and trace element studies of the Dufek layered  mafic intrusion in the Pensacola Mountains, Antarctica. This  research utilizes 338 samples that were collected on field  expeditions in 1993 and 1995. The Dufek intrusion is one of  the largest bodies of its kind in the world, and  mineralogical relationships preserved in it offer insights  crystallization and chemical differentiation processes in  large volumes of relatively homogeneous magmas.  New work to  be done under this project will focus on measuring elemental  concentrations and isotopic ratios of Nd, Sr, and Pb within  individual mineral grains from two stratigraphic intervals  in the intrusion (the Frost Pyroxenite to Spear Anorthosite  section and the Lower Inclusion Member to Upper Inclusion  Member section).  These analyses will be used to model  chemical differentiation of key minerals during the  crystallization process and to identify possible chemical  signatures of magma chamber recharge event or magma  contamination by melting of the surrounding wall rocks which  are known to occur in large mafic magma bodies.  Both  sequences of rock contain abrupt changes in mineralogy and  chemical composition.  These chemical and mineralogical  studies will allow comparison of the Dufek to the intrusive  sills of the Ferrar Group from other parts of the  Transantarctic Mountains.  Inasmuch as data from the first  phase of study suggested that assimilation and fractional  crystallization were important processes in the Dufek magma  chamber, the new data acquired under this project will also  be modeled using differential equations that calculate the  mass rate of assimilation of surrounding rock relative to  crystallization within the intrusion.",
