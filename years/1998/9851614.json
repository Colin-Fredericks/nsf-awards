 "awd_abstract_narration": "A consortium of the three primarily undergraduate universities in Tacoma, Washington is introducing fluorescent automated sequencing and genotyping to their students. The sequencer/genotyper allows introduction of labs that engage majors in the collection and analysis of original data. Although the sequencer is used most heavily for junior/senior level labs (212 students/year) and in senior thesis or capstone projects (20 40 students/year), it is also used to enhance the undergraduate experience at all levels. Freshmen and students in the non-majors biology courses (596 students/year) are introduced to the techniques of molecular biology through a population study of local salmon species. Both majors and non-majors in classes that emphasize the connection between science and society (190 students/year) are genotyping themselves or sequencing a portion of their own DNA, an exercise that helps them to understand the technology and how it is used.  In the upper-level electives, each college is implementing focused research projects that will allows students to design and carry out original research during the course. Most of these research projects are directly related to Pacific Northwest organisms or ecological problems. The data generated is useful to government agencies and community groups in the area. Research students and principal investigators at all three institutions also present papers and posters at regional and national meetings; thus disseminating the results of this project to the scientific and educational communities.",
