 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry   Program, is directed at the development of new instrumentation and   methodologies to enhance the capabilities of capillary electrophoresis   (CE).  A novel double-beam absorbance geometry is employed whereby two   photodiode arrays are used to obtain spatially resolved detection while   correcting for background absorbance and source drift.  Development of   flow counterbalanced CE, based on a hydrostatically driven liquid flow,   is directed at enhancing detectability and resolution.  A jet flow   interface is being investigated as a rapid means of sample introduction.    Size exclusion chromatography is used as an additional separation means   prior to the presently employed liquid chromatography-CE multidimensional   methodology.  Finally, the development of methods for using ultra-high   voltages (300 kV) is investigated in an attempt to open a new mode of CE   operation.     Methods of separating the constituents of complex samples are integral   to developments in biological and environmental analyses.  Professor   Jorgenson's laboratory is a leader in the development of new   instrumentation for capillary electrophoresis.  Capillary electrophoresis   is a very important tool in the analysis of biological samples, such as   blood and urine, and is finding increased usage in the analysis of   environmental specimens as well.  Work in this area has led to faster,    more sensitive, and more reliable analyses.  The work to be done by   Professor Jorgenson and his students is likely to result in new   approaches and instrumentation for complex chemical analyses.",
