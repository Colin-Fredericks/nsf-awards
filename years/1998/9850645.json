 "awd_abstract_narration": "The hands-on student use of computer technology in chemical education is mandatory in preparing undergraduate students for careers in the basic sciences and technology. This project addresses this need by incorporating several novel computer exercises into our present undergraduate curriculum in general chemistry, physical chemistry, biochemistry and senior seminar.  We are using 18 high performance personal computers and molecular modeling software HYPERCHEM and CHEMOFFICE to establish a student molecular graphics and modeling laboratory. This equipment provides: (i) upper division physical chemistry, biochemistry, and senior seminar students in-depth meaningful training exercises in the use of computer modeling of atomic and molecular structure and dynamics, (ii) general chemistry students an initial taste of the power and insight afforded by the visualization capabilities of modern molecular graphics, and (iii) the chemical education community at-large with tested tools and strategies for incorporation of computational chemistry into the curriculum. The project is broken down into several subprojects entitled (a) Introduction to Atomic & Molecular Orbitals (AMO), (b) Advanced Visualization of Atomic and Molecular Orbitals (AVAMO), (c) Molecular Graphics of Macromolecular Structure (MG), (d) Molecular Modeling of Macromolecules (MM), (e) Kinetic Molecular Theory Simulation (BOLTZ), (f) Spreadsheet Applications in Chemistry (SPR~AD), (c) Gas Phase Reaction Dynamics Simulations (RXDYN), and (h) Accessing Chemical Data Bases (CHE~FO).  Results of the project and corollary instructional materials are being disseminated to the chemical education community via the WWW, publication in ACS journals, and presentation at national and regional meetings. Additional exercises will be incorporated later pending the success of this venture.",
