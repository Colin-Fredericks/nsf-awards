TWBG will make widespread use of these camera-ready math puzzles in a variety of ways and formats. The primary audience for this campaign is the general adult population.  The secondary audience is the middle school students and their parents, including persons serving as parent surrogates (i.e., extended family, foster parents,  daycare providers, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis initiative will be a grassroots effort capable of reaching every community throughout the United States.  TWBG will be expected to make creative use and/ or collaboration with mass media, policy/administrative/teaching and grassroots organizations, corporations, and federal and state agencies in dissemination of the message about the campaign.\r\n",
