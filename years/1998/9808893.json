 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will consist in the recuration of scale  insect (COCCOIDEA) collection.  A large part of the  collection is from China and Southeast Asia, and  represents the world's largest collection of scale  insects and hosts plants from this region.  The entire  scale insect collection consists of 50,000 glass slide-  mounted specimens, 200 primary types, 16,000 samples of  dried plant material with scale insects in situ, and 500  line drawings, correspondence, and field notebooks.  All of the scale insects and host plants are identified  to genus, and in most cases, species.  This collection  is of unique scientific value: the specimens are from  areas that can no longer be collected; both the scale  insects and the plant hosts are identified; all  developmental stages and parasites are often included;  and these dried specimens make ideal material for  molecular systematic studies.    For long term safekeeping of this invaluable resource,  four major curatorial needs must be addressed: placement  in acid-free containers, protection from insect pests,  updating specimen taxonomy, and facilitation information  retrieval.  In many cases the specimens themselves are  in need of curatorial attention or of stabilization.  Additionally, the slide collection will be evaluated for  relabeling or remounting and will be bar coded.  The  majority of dried specimens on dried plant material are  housed in individual cardboard boxes, which are highly  acidic and must be replaced.  The enclosed specimens  need to be re-wrapped in buffered tissue for added  protection.  In addition, roughly 3,000 dried specimens,  mostly from exotic locations, are  still housed in  various kinds of packaging just as they were received  through the mail.  These specimens need to be moved into  standard sized archival boxes like the rest of the  collection.  Each new box plus contents will be sealed  in plastic bags to eliminate damage by insect pests.",
