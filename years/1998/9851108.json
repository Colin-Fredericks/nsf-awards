 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exciting and important advances in applied optics should play a much more significant role in the undergraduate science and engineering curricula. With this need in mind the curriculum at the University of Arkansas has been designed to provide a series of four courses in modern optics for science and engineering students: Optics and Laser Physics, Applied Non-Linear Optics, and Fiber and Waveguide Optics. Students in Optics and Laser Physics learn the fundamentals l-f both physical and wave optics and they develop specific skills in the design, construction, and analysis of state-of-the-art laser systems. These skills are further developed in Applied Non-Linear Optics where students investigate concepts and devices finding widespread applications in science and technology. All three of these courses at Arkansas combine both classroom and strong \"hands-on\" laboratory experiences to enhance student interest and maximize the learning experience.     The Fiber and Waveguide Optics course develops a foundation in the generation, modulation, transmission and detection of laser light, all of which are integrally related and vitally important for the continued development of advanced fiber optic systems. This project reinforces the enthusiasm shown by science and engineering students in this course with an opportunity to develop their talents and interest into specific skills. The Fiber and Waveguide Optics laboratory explores several key aspects of fiber optics to develop skills in (I) Propagation in Fibers and Waveguides, (ii) Semiconductor Lasers, Amplifiers, and Detector; (iii) Optical Modulators, and (iv) Fiber Optic Systems. In each area, the equipment gives the students experience with actual techniques used throughout the fiber optics research community.",
