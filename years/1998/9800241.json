 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Working with Biotechnology\" is a Demonstration Project that  strengthens and deepens the highly successful activities of  \"Biotechnology Works!\", a summer institute in immunology and  genetics for students with disabilities and their high school  teachers.  The projected outcomes of the Working with  Biotechnology project are to effect long-term changes in the: 1)  participation of persons with disabilities in the sciences; 2)  methods, materials, and curricula used in high school science  classes, particularly in chemistry and biology; 3) practices and  preparation of high school science teachers; and 4) practices and  preparation of high school guidance counselors.  The intended  impact of this project will be that persons with disabilities  will enter science careers and that new discoveries will be made  in science that will benefit humankind.  This project should have  a long term impact on the number of students with disabilities  who take advanced science courses in high schools and in higher  education, the number of students with disabilities who pursue  careers in science, the practices and preparation of high school  science teachers, the practices and preparation of high school  guidance counselors, and high school science curricula and  instruction.    Over a three-year period, this project will work intensively and  comprehensively with high school students with disabilities,  their science teachers, and high school guidance counselors in  Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont to pilot, develop, refine, and  disseminate curriculum materials, science laboratory materials,  and career development information.  The following activities  (inputs or objectives) will be conducted:       extend curriculum adaptations for students with disabilities        in immunology and genetics that were developed during               Biotechnology Works!     refine curriculum adaptations for students with disabilities        in immunology and genetics that were developed during               Biotechn ology Works!     field test curriculum and adaptations through two summer            institutes in 1998 and 1999 in immunology and genetics for          high school students and high school science teachers      mentoring of high school science students     mentoring of high school science teachers      develop curriculum materials and information for high school        science teachers      prepare career development materials and information for high       school guidance counselors on promoting and encouraging the         participation of students with disabilities in science careers      intensive dissemination of materials and information through        the World Wide Web, workshops, listserves, press releases,          national conferences, journal articles, and the ERIC         Clearinghouse.",
