Building on\r\nthe existing pipeline strategy that spans from K-1 2 to graduate research developed with\r\nNSF support, UPR- IMGEP will increase annual degrees conferred from 13 to 26 by the year\r\n2003 and increase enrollment of minority students from the mainland to 30%.  The main\r\nstrategy is a continuum of support for transition into and completion of Ph.D. studies,\r\nbeginning with recruitment strategies of undergraduate students in research, and support\r\nduring their first year through a bridging seminar and peer mentors.  To increase candidates\r\nfor academic careers and future role models for minority students, a Teaching Assistantship\r\nTraining Program will be created.  In their second and third year, students will participate in\r\nthe Increasing Scholarly Productivity Program to support the elaboration of dissertations,\r\nscientific publications and presentations, grantsmanship skills and time management skills.\r\nTwo year fellowships will be provided to attract students into critical areas of shortage and\r\ninto academic careers.  The UPR Vice Presidency and Academic Deans for SMET will lead\r\nthe strategic planning and institutionalization of the program.  The UPR will cost share\r\n$1.25 million.\r\n\r\n",
