 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory (RMBL) is an  independent, nonprofit field station with no institutional  affiliation, which provides facilities for researchers who  wish to study high-altitude biology in a field setting.  This project will assist in purchasing PC workstations,  network capability, peripherals, and software to enhance  the Lab's data management system (DMS).    The RMBL has developed a preliminary plan for data  management that establishes policies and guidelines for  use and access of the RMBL DMS.  An enhanced DMS will  provide 1) for the security, access, maintenance, and  documentation for key data sets maintained by RMBL (e.g.,  weather records, land management, species inventories,  research activities, and maps of facilities), 2) a  convenient means for scientists and students to enter,  document access, and archive data sets as part of a  library of databases for RMBL, 3) a geographic information  system (GIS) facility as a means for students and  researchers to analyze and model spatially related  phenomena at RMBL, 4) a facility for training students in  data management techniques, and 5) an organized platform  for the integration of published RMBL research, enhancing  its value for providing scientific information to  relevant agencies in the region and to the lay community.    The RMBL DMS will be implemented in phases, and priority  will be given to enhancing computing capability and  accessibility for students and visiting scientists to RMBL  data resources.  RMBL has established a data management  policy, made preliminary choices of hardware and software,  and hired a half-time data manager who will begin  developing data catalogs.  During the time period of this  proposal RMBL will install an LAN with server that  includes the RMBL administrative offices, the library, and  the student computer facility in Barclay Classroom  Building.  Initial access to the network by RMBL  investigators will be via public access computers on the  LAN, or via phone connec tion to the Internet and the RMBL  homepage from their laboratory offices.  The Lab also will  construct data catalogs for placement on the RMBL home  page, develop RMBL GIS data layers, and purchase  appropriate hardware to enhance GIS capability.",
