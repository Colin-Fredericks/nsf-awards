 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  introduction  of modern technology to a variety  of  complex  dynamic  domains  has  led  to  benefits  such  as  an  increased  precision and efficiency of operations. These benefits appear  to  accrue  primarily in situations where automated  systems  perform  tasks on their own, i.e., without operator involvement.  In other  situations,  where  humans and machines  need  to  cooperate  and  coordinate their activities, unexpected difficulties with  human-  automation  communication are being encountered.  The  short-term  goal  of  this  combined  research and education  program  is  to  improve   the  communicative  skills  of  modern  (flight   deck)  technology through the development of new forms of multimodal and  graded automation feedback. Its long-term objective is to prevent  the  (re)creation  of similar or new problems with  human-machine  collaboration by training students at the University of  Illinois  in  a  practice-oriented  approach to  system  design  where  the  constraints  of  the  human,  the machine  agent,  and  the  task  environment are identified and integrated early on. This  project  serves  to advance our understanding of mechanisms and strategies  mediating  successful and poor human-automation coordination.  It  emphasizes the importance of combining a reactive and a proactive  approach    to    reducing   difficulties   with    human-machine  communication.   And  it  contributes to the  important  goal  of  promoting  the  transfer  of basic research  results  to  applied  system design.",
