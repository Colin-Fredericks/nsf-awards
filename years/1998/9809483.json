Research in this Center, which has been named the Princeton Center for Complex Materials, is organized into four interdisciplinary research groups.  The Center also provides seed funding for new opportunities in materials research.  The Center supports efforts in materials education at all levels including summer undergraduate research experiences, a topical summer institute for graduate students working on materials-related areas, and outreach to the pre-college level via an internet-based software developed by the Center and prototyped in a nearby science museum.  The MRSEC also supports shared experimental facilities that are accessible to center participants and to outside users, and has strong research collaborations with industry and national laboratories.\r\n\r\nA common theme in the four interdisciplinary research groups of the MRSEC is fundamental understanding of the links between molecular structure or mesoscopic texture and macroscopic properties with the goal of rationally designing materials for technological purposes.  One group investigates the unusual phases and excitations in low-dimensional electronic materials, including high temperature superconductors and semiconductor heterostructures.  A second group explores engineered structures based on semiconducting organic thin films for application to optoelectronic devices.  A third group pursues the materials science of organic molecules that order spontaneously in solutions or melts with an outlook on advanced lubricant and novel lithographic applications.  A fourth group emphasizes the development of nanostructured composites with improved mechanical and dielectric properties by mimicking biological composite materials.  Participants in the Center currently include 26 senior investigators, 8 postdoctoral associates, 16 graduate students, 14 undergraduates, and 3 technicians and other support personnel.  Professor William B. Russel directs the MRSEC.\r\n",
