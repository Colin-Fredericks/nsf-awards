The meeting will meet that need by drawing together researchers and scientists who have been involved in USGCRP-sponsored IA research, federal scientists and program managers, and members of the scientific community working in related specialties. The workshop is important, especially given past federal sponsorship of Integrated Assessment research and the need to define more precisely a role for Integrated Assessment in the federal investment portfolio. The workshop will be especially valuable for the USGCRP, which now plays a direct role its role in conducting assessments related to global environmental changes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
