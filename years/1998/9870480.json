 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gartner  98-70480    This project describes sabbatical-year activities designed  to increase the PI's ability to integrate research in  Ecophysiology and wood science through research and visits  to labs.  The funded work involves research on evergreen oak  seedlings (Quercus ilex) in a glasshouse, asking how wood  accommodates the simultaneous needs to transport water and  to provide mechanical support.  The PI expects that  seedlings grown at high angels from vertical will use more  of their stem for specialized mechanical support, and thus  will have less cross-section available for water transport.  The PI will measure mechanical, hydraulic,  and growth  characteristics of the seedlings, followed by investigating  their wood anatomy.  If other funds are available, the PI  will supplement this research with a study of branches at  different angles on older trees in the field, and PI will  visit laboratories where other scientists are working with  trees and wood.  The site visits will help the PI put  research in context and increase the PI's knowledge of these  research areas in Europe.  Further understanding of how wood  functions in living trees will help the PIs understand  drought adaptations, and will give the PIs more predictive  power on how our forest manipulations will affect wood  quality for forest products.",
