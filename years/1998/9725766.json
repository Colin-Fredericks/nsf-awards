 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725766  Wernicke    It is unclear if intracontinental plate boundaries, usually  expressed as wide zones of diffuse deformation, behave as a system  of microplates, or as a continuum.  The Great Basin is a prime  example of an area that behaves in this way.  To determine if the  observed strain pattern of today reflects a microplate trend, an 18  station GPS network has been established and has been operating for  one year.  This award provides an additional three years of funding  to complete a total of four years of monitoring the network.  After  such time, the rate uncertainties will be sufficient to distinguish  between microplate and continuum behavior.    The basic scientific question to be solved will be a better  understanding of intracontinental plate boundaries.  This  understanding is a fundamental concept to add to our knowledge of  plate tectonics.  In addition, the seismic hazard of such areas may  be further quantified.  To such an end, it is important to know if  intraplate strain is localized within seismic belts, or if  seismicity migrates secularly across a wide zone of relatively  uniform strain accumulation.  To solve this question, the Principal  Investigator is using a series of GPS stations to compute yearly  displacement in mm/yr and its distribution.  From this, stress and  strain can be calculated and the stress field examined to answer  these questions.  ***",
