 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728758  Numan    For survival of the species, the young must be cared for until they can subsist on their own.  Until recently, little research has been directed towards the elucidation of the neural mechanisms that underlie maternal  behavior.  It is now clear that the regulation of maternal behavior requires the integration of hormonal, neural, neurochemical and behavioral factors  Dr. Numan has demonstrated that maternal behavior occurs at the end of pregnancy because hormones act on the brain to decrease fear or avoidance of infant stimuli and to increase attraction or approach towards the infant.  He will now uncover the neural substrate that underlies such an approach-avoidance model of maternal responsiveness.  Using a variety of state-of-the art molecular, neurochemical, anatomical, and behavioral techniques, Dr. Numan will examine his theory that maternal behavior is promoted when the output of the amygdala is inhibited while the output of the medial preoptic area is facilitated.  This fundamental research will help us understand how hormones interact with limbic (amydgala) and hypothalamic (medial preoptic area) neural circuits to control a critical complex behavior.  Moreover, understanding the normal process is the type of basic research that will eventually lead to uncovering some of the biological and behavioral causes of poor mothering such as child abuse and neglect, as well as disorders such as postpartum depression.",
