 "awd_abstract_narration": "9724719  Loiselle    This Americas Program dissertation enhancement grant will  fund Grace Servat,  under the direction of Dr. Bette  Loiselle, University of  Missouri, St. Louis,  on a study to  elucidate the patterns and underlying mechanisms that shape  the foraging ecology of birds associated with a unique  woodland habitat of  the High Andes in South America.  This  community is well suited for the present study because it is  a distinctive biological system characterized by high levels  of endemism, its scattered distribution in the Andes  provides discrete replicates for study,  and the plant and  bird species composition are relatively simple, when  compared to more species-rich forests at lower elevation,  thus facilitating detailed ecological studies at a community  level.  The major objectives of the study are to document  and compare, across replicate sites, the foraging ecology of  individual bird species feeding on arboreal arthropods; to  determine the extent to which patterns observed in the  foraging ecology of bird species and the assemblage as a  whole are repeated across regions; and to determine which  scale and factors best explain variation in the foraging  ecology of individual species.  The research will integrate  natural history observations with detailed ecological  studies on availability of arthropod resources, vegetation  structures and the abundance of potential competitors and  predators.    The proposed study will contribute new information about a  distinctive and highly threatened Andean system, as well as  provide a model to examine the importance of  local and  regional processes in shaping individual foraging ecology  and community patterns.  ***",
