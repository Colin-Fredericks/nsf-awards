Stone\r\n\r\nIn many statistical models of current theoretical and practical interest, the log-likelihood function depends on one or more unknown functions.  The theory and methodology of such models, referred to as extended linear models, are particularly tractable when the models are concave; that is, when the log-likelihood depends concavely on the unknown function or functions.  Among the class of concave extended linear models are regression; logistic, probit, Poisson, and other forms of generalized regression; multiple logistic regression (which is useful in multiple classification); hazard regression for survival analysis; the extension of hazard regression to event history analysis; and models for the estimation of density and conditional density functions.  In the context of such models, polynomial splines and their tensor products are natural building blocks for constructing finite-dimensional estimates of infinite-dimensional main effects and low-order interactions, and the resulting ANOVA decompositions provide an insightful tool for data analysis.  Corresponding nonadaptive theory and adaptive methodology have been extensively developed in recent years.  In this research, in order to reduce the gap between the existing theory and methodology and to improve on the methodology, similar theory and methodology and methodology for free knot splines are being developed, in which knot locations are viewed as free parameters to be determined by the maximum likelihood method along with the other parameters of the model.\r\n\r\nThe investigator is concurrently working on a monograph on extended linear modeling with splines with four of his collaborators, all former Ph. D. students and Research Assistants on previous NSF Grants of the investigator.  The research on free knot splines will be incorporated into the monograph.  This should contribute to the civil infrastructure by encouraging the inclusion of spline-based methodology in commercial statistical software packages, which would facilitate its use in the analysis of data of scientific and industrial importance.  It should also extend the appeal of this methodology to include researchers in the data mining community.\r\n",
