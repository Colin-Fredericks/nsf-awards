 "awd_abstract_narration": "A stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer facility is  proposed at the University of Wyoming to address several  multidisciplinary processes including carbon flux between  ecosystems and the atmosphere, ecosystem responses to  simulated climate change, patterns of precipitation isotopic  chemistry, reconstruction of climates using proxy records,  and the geochemistry of environmental contamination.  At  present, no such facility exists in the state of Wyoming.  This proposal funds the purchase of a dual inlet isotope  ration mass spectrometer for high precision analysis of the  stable isotopes of H, C, N, S, and O in air, water, soil,  and vegetation.  This instrument will support numerous  ongoing studies that utilize stable isotope analyses to  enhance a basic understanding of terrestrial processes.  These include: 1) delineating the CO2 source and sink  activity of native and agricultural ecosystems; 2)  quantifying the degree to which changes in snow depth alter  the patterns of water sources used by plants and modifies  the flux of carbon; 3) assessing the weekly patterns of the  isotopic composition of precipitation from an array of sites  across the U.S; 4) applying the isotopic composition of  plant tissues as paleoclimate proxies; 5) using stable  isotopes to identify sources and processes affecting  groundwater contaminants such as nitrate and hazardous  organic compounds; and 6) characterizing the seasonal  foraging patterns of free-ranging ungulates and applying  this to the reconstruction of anthropological diets and  predation strategies.  The major focus of the proposed facility will be to nurture  an expansion of interdisciplinary collaboration among  diverse research teams.  In addition, this instrumentation  will provide regular exposure and research training  opportunities for upper division undergraduates, graduate  students, and postdoctoral scientists while encouraging  other researchers on campus to utilize stable isotopes as  part of their research.  Finally, the facility  will perform  analyses that will contribute to several new national and  international research initiatives, including a U.S.  contribution to the Global Network of Isotopes in  Precipitation (GNIP) and the Biosphere-Atmosphere Stable  Isotope Network (BASIN).",
