The award is funded by the  Materials Theory Program in the Division of Materials  Research and by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities  in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.  The  NSF grant is coordinated with a similar one at DOE.    Properties of highly correlated electrons, in particular,  heavy fermion systems, mixed valent maganite compounds,  Kondo insulators and one-dimensional conductors are studied  theoretically.  In heavy fermions the main focus is on the  simultaneous treatment of Kondo screening and intersite  interactions, effects of correlations among the itinerant  electrons on the heavy electrons and the faint  antiferromagneticallly ordered magnetic moments observed in  some heavy-fermion compounds.  The quadrupolar (Jahn-Teller)  response of mixed valent manganese ions is studied within  the framework of manganese impurity models and a pair of  manganese ions.  The origin of bound-states in the gap of  Kondo insulators and the difference of spin and charge gaps  are investigated.  Methods employed are the Bethe Ansatz,  the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method, and slave boson  approaches.  %%%  This is a grant for theoretical research on strongly  correlated electron systems.  The award is funded by the  Materials Theory Program in the Division of Materials  Research and by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities  in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.  The  NSF grant is coordinated with a similar one at DOE.    A number of theoretical approaches will be taken to study  strongly correlated electron systems.  These systems include  the so-called heavy fermion systems, mixed valent maganite  compounds, Kondo insulators and one-dimensional conductors.  Both the systems to be studied and the techniques to be used  are at the forefront of modern condensed matter physics.  ***",
