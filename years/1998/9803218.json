 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803218  Furdyna  This  renewal  proposal by Profs. J. Furdyna (University  of  Notre  Dame),  J.J. Rhyne (University of Missouri/Columbia),  with    Prof. C.M. Sorensen (Kansas State University)  as  a  sub-contractor  describes research using neutron  scattering  experiments   to   study  semiconductor   thin   films   and  nanostructures in order to gain an understanding of magnetic  ordering  and  magnetic interactions in such  systems.   The  proposed  research is composed of three interrelated  areas:  the  identification of mechanisms which determine interlayer  coupling  in MnSe- and MnTe-based superlattices,  systematic  investigations to enable distinguishing between the  effects  of  strain  and  those of dilution on the  antiferromagnetic  transitions  in  Mn(1-x)IIxIV alloys, and a new  exploratory  investigation of spin ordering and exchange interactions  in  magnetic  semiconductor nano-particles.  Specific thin  film  systems  are  MnTe/Zn(1-x)MnxTe   superlattices  and   Mn(1-  x)MgxTe with varying doping values of x.  Also to be studied  are the magnetic properties of Mn nanocrystals.  %%%  The   objective  of  this  research  is  to  apply   neutron  scattering  techniques to magnetic semiconductor thin  films  and  nanostructures  in  order  to  gain  understanding   of  magnetic   ordering  and  magnetic  interactions  in   these  systems.   Magnetic semiconductors are of great  fundamental  interest  in  magnetism, because their manganese sublattices  constitute  frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnets  governed  by  short-range interactions.  Three areas of  investigation  are  proposed. First, magnetic/non-magnetic superlattices  ,  such  as  manganese-tellurium/zinc-tellurium will be studied  in  order  to elucidate the mechanisms responsible  for  the  coupling  between magnetic layers for magnetic interactions.  In  the  second  part the investigators will  exploit  newly  developed techniques for growing materials composed of group  II  and group VI elements (II-VI all oys), specifically  with  the group IIa elements magnesium and berillium, in order  to  elucidate  the  effect  of  dilution  and  strain   on   the  antiferromagnetic transition in diluted magnetic alloys.  In  the  third part an exploratory pilot program will be started  that   focuses   on   neutron  scattering   in   II-VI-based  nanoparticles  containing high concentrations of  manganese.  These  studies will be performed in a collaboration  between  the  principal  investigator Prof.  Furdyna  (University  of  Notre  Dame), the co-principal investigator Prof. J.J. Rhyne  (University  of Missouri - Columbia), and the sub-contractor  Prof.  C.M.  Sorensen of the Kansas State  University.   The  researches   promise   to    contribute   greatly   to   the  understanding of magnetic interactions and thereby assist in  the development of new and improved practical devices.  ***",
