The principal objective is to serve  the southeast region of the United States as a center for  summer undergraduate research participation in physics.  Grants of \"Summer Junior Fellowships\" will be made to  applicants interested in investigating physics research as a  career.  Special consideration will be given to applications  from women and minorities, and from the many small schools  in the region which have either no graduate programs or  limited research facilities.  The program will afford  research experience in many areas of physics with the  experimental nuclear physics research group serving as the  host with principal responsibility for the program.  The available areas of experimental research include nuclear  physics, particle physics, solid state physics including  materials research, high Tc superconductors, surface and  polymer crystal physics, high field magnetism, and  theoretical computational physics.  Summer Junior Fellows  will be placed in established research programs according to  their interest, as expressed in their application, and their  acceptance by the research group participating in the REU-  Site program.  ***",
