 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research collections of birds and mammals at The Field  Museum rank among the world's largest and most  comprehensive.  Both include virtually all families, most  genera and about 85% and 65% of the world's known bird and  mammal species, respectively.  A century of international  collecting activity has enriched these collections with  tropical taxa that are poorly represented elsewhere.  Currently, the catalogued collections include more than  420,000 bird specimens and 160,000 mammal specimens. All of  these specimens have been  curated, installed, and entered  into computer databases; computer records have been verified  against specimen labels and shelf-and drawercontents for all  but a small fraction of each collection. Encyclopedic  coverage and high-quality modern preparations of these  collections attract heavy research use.  Both Bird and  Mammal collections rank among the nation's most heavily  utilized collections in terms of numbers of scientific  visitors and number and size of specimen loans; information  on these collections is now available over the Internet, and  more will be made available by the end of 1997.  The impact  of these collections on the scientific community can be  gauged by the number of publications appearing each year  that are based entirely or in part on the Field Museum's  collections.  Since 1980, the Bird and Mammal collections  and facilities have served as the basis for more than a 1200  articles.    Bird and Mammal personnel continue to build the collections  via active field programs in the Neotropics, Africa,  Madagascar, and Southeast Asia, as well as in the United  States.  In contrast to historic collections modern  collections have attempted to accommodate the diversity of  approaches to systematic zoology by preserving a wide range  of preparation types, now often including tissues for gentic  analyses.  Since 1976 some 12,000 tubes of avian tissues and  10,000 tubes of mammal tissues have been received.    This project will assist in the tra nsfer of the frozen  tissue collections to new, expanded and safer storage.  The  two collections, which will remain separate, will be  deposited in a newly-established storage facility,  consisting of liquid nitrogen storage vessels.  The new  installation will increase capacity for archival storage  from 25,000 tubes to 60,000 tubes.  As tubes are transferred  from one storage system to another, the project will (1)  verify existing database record for each tissue tube,  (2)  determine the unique catalogue number in Bird and Mammal  catalogues that corresponds to each field number, (3)  generate and affix a bar-coded and numbered label to each  tube, and (4) record its location in the new storage system.  The end result will be that these collections will be  archived at a temperature at which we can be assured no  degradation will occur, and through the use of the bar-  coding label system, these collections will be more-  effectively labeled and immediately connected to the  computerized databases of our main collections.  Thus,  handling this valuable material will be more efficient and  less harmful to long-term preservation.",
