 "awd_abstract_narration": "INT-9714563  Jordan    This U.S.-Russia Cooperative Project is on \"Rav-en.net: Russian-American Virtual Enterprise Network Primary RAVEN Server Connection and Development.\"  The principal investigator is Dr. James A. Jordan of the Institute for International Manufacturing Enterprise Research  IIMER , a non-profit research group in San Luis Obispo, California.    The purpose of the ra-ven.net effort is to implement a practical network mechanism in which to assist in the initial phase of RAVEN development.  RAVEN is a U.S.-Russian cooperative effort to develop a prototype electronic network that will enable U.S. manufacturers to access specialized capabilities of the Russian manufacturing base.  In a larger sense, RAVEN will facilitate the development of U.S.-Russian virtual enterprises as part of the global manufacturing infrastructure.  To accomplish this, IIMER will develop, install, and connect to the Internet a dedicated network server for RAVEN; develop content associated with the primary network activity related to WWW, Telnet, FTP, and Index search engine service for RAVEN network development; maintain and moderate all network activity; assist in the installation and the connection of 10 Russian counterpart Internet accounts; compile existing Department of Commerce Bureau of Export Administration and Defense Nuclear Agency \"Russian Business Information\" into a network of searchable and readable form; and submit a final, one year, report of RAVEN development progress.  By creating a central Internet based network for the development of RAVEN, much more interactivity will be possible, at a minimal cost and higher efficiency rate, between U.S. and Russian counterparts in the development of a complete RAVEN program and implementation vehicle.  By creating a central information bank for network communications, index servers, and program information, it will be possible to attract the attention of a much larger educational, scientific, and industry base in which to be involved with  the development of RAVEN.    This research in computer science fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.    ***  ??",
