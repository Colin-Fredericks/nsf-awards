 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine changes in gender differences in victimization of men and women by lethal violence, including suicide, homicide, and accidents. The theory motivating the research leads to several predictions: (1) Regarding time trends, gender differences in lethal violence first narrow and then widen with continued change toward gender equality; (2) regarding age, the reversal in the direction of the trend in gender differences occurs more quickly and with a smaller narrowing among younger groups; (3) regarding national differences, the adjustment occurs more quickly and with a smaller narrowing among nations with collectivist political institutions. The project will gather data on: mortality from suicide, homicide, and accidents for men and women of all ages in 18 nations between 1953-1992; over-time female labor force participation, national product, unemployment, marriage, divorce, fertility rates, public spending for children, social protection, and maternity care; national indicators of institutional structures promoting collective social protection, social equality, and women's participation in the economy and polity. With these data we can describe trends, patterns, and variation in gender differences in lethal violence using measures of mortality from suicide, homicide, and accidents for each age group, year, and nation, and study the effects of dynamic and institutional variables. Although focused primarily on macro-level processes, the findings should provide a more detailed understanding of the consequences of changes in gender inequality, and shed light on the experiences of gender equality in the United States compared to the experiences of similar high income democracies with different policies and structures of collective social protection.",
