 "awd_abstract_narration": "The functonalization of C60 and C70 by means of a (2+2) photocyclization   of cyclic enones onto the fullerene skeleton will be examined.   The   generality and chemoselectivity of the methodology will be developed   through a selective use of different enones, and comparisons of the   product distributions obtained with C60 and C70 fullerenes.   Mechanistic   details will be elucidated with particular attention paid to   understanding why the high energy enone triplets prefer to undergo the   chemical reaction with the fullerene skeleton, rather than energy   transfer to a lower energy fullerene triplet state.   Metalloporphyrins   tethered to the fullerenes will be achieved by means of this   photosynthetic methodology, and the photoinduced electron transfer   between the tethered fragments examined.   Graduate and undergraduate   students will be involved in all aspects of the research including its   presentation at scientific meetings.     With this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program   supports the research and educational activities of Professors Schuster   and Wilson of the Department of Chemistry at New York University.    Professors Schuster and Wilson will focus their research efforts on   generalizing a photochemical methodology for functionalizing C60 and C70   fullerenes.   Photophysical experiments will be undertaken to elucidate   the mechanism of addition and the  factors affecting the rate of chemical   reaction with the fullerene skeleton relative to the rate of energy   transfer.   Professors Schuster and Wilson involve both graduate and   undergraduate in all aspects of the work making the research and its   presentation educational vehicles.",
