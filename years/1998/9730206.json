This curriculum resource grows out of and extends projects of the Math Forum such as Ask Dr. Math in which users interact with mathematicians and these interactions are achieved as a resource for others to use.  The project exploits features on the WWW that enable independent exploration for remedial and advanced work, takes advantage of opportunities for non-linear learning, provides access to multiple approaches for problem solving, and involves users in the continuing development process.  In this proof-of-concept phase, the PI will develop and test the hypertext environment by providing different voices that can be accessed and used to present several key perspectives that maintain their integrity but enable the user to pursue an investigation matching his or her needs and interests.  Cost sharing is 6%.",
