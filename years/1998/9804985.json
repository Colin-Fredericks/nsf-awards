 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to study high order numerical\r\nmethods for shock calculations and for computational electromagnetics.\r\nHigh order methods can resolve complicated physical problems with a\r\nrelatively coarse mesh, hence reducing computational cost for such\r\nproblems.  However, high order methods for shock calculations and for\r\ncomputational electromagnetics involve many theoretical and practical\r\nissues which must be investigated.  The proposed work involves the\r\ndevelopment, analysis, and applications of high order finite difference,\r\nfinite element and spectral methods in the applications areas of\r\ncomputational fluid dynamics and computational electromagnetics.\r\nTwo emphasized aspects of the proposed effort are complex geometries\r\nand efficient parallel implementations. In particular, the proposal contains the following components: high order methods for shock wave calculations, including finite difference ENO and WENO schemes, finite element discontinuous Galerkin methods, spectral methods, and high order methods in computational\r\nelectromagnetics, including spectral methods, spectral multidomain\r\nmethods, and absorbing layers. It is expected that the proposed effort will improve the state of art in high order methods for discontinuous problems and long time integrations, especially in complex geometry.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
