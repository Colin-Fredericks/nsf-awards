The  goal  of this study is  to  elucidate  how  the  physiology of one important group of such animals allows them  to  survive desert conditions. Developing this understanding requires  addressing  three  basic questions. (1) What themmal  and  hydric  environments do these animals occupy in nature? (2) How do  these  animals  thermoregulate under such conditions? (3)  How  do  they  meet  their  water  requirements?  This  study  will  focus  upon  kangaroo  rats, which are small rodents that are among  the  most  conspicuously  successful groups of desert mammals.  The  thermal  and  hydric  conditions  experienced by these  small  mammals  in  subtropical  deserts  will be quantified. Physiological  analyses  will  focus  upon determining how closely these animals  approach  their  limits  of tolerance to dehydration and high environmental  temperatures  under  naturally prevailing conditions.  This  will  include  analyses of (a) short-term effects of high environmental  temperatures upon body temperature, (b) intemmediate-term effects  associated with animal dehydration during activity, and long-temm  effects  mediated through alterations in the location and  timing  of animal activity in nature.",
