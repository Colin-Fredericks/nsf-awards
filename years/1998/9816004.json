 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal supports the development of global change  research capacity in eighteen countries in the Americas, and  represents a contribution of the United States Government to  a project grant from the World Bank's Global Environment  Facility (GEF) that is administered through the United  Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and executed by the  Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI),  an initiative to stimulate global change research among the  scientific institutions of the Americas.  The eligible  countries are: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,  Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Jamaica, Mexico,  Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.  The proposal will support the training of specialists in the  use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as tools for  conducting for global change research, using equipment  bought by the project and software donated by both the  Government of Brazil and the European Centre for Medium-  range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF).  The project will support  the purchase of reference materials for research, and the  purchase of a limited number of LANDSAT scenes for training  and research on global change issues.  The project will  support a small number of graduate students through a  scholarship program, and provide the backbone for a data and  information system for the exchange of global change data  resulting from IAI-sponsored research between members of  research teams in the Americas, including the USA and  Canada.  This project will specifically give US researchers  access to data sets from the rest of the Americas that have  previously been inaccessible.  The National Science  Foundation is the designated U.S. Government agency to carry  out U.S. responsibilities within the IAI.",
