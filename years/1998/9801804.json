Moewes,  Louisiana  State   and   three   national  laboratories   E.L. Shirley, National Institute of Standards  and  Technology;  R.C.  Perera,  Lawrence  Berkeley  Laboratory;  L.J.  Terminello.   Lawrence  Livermore  National  Laboratory ,    will  continue their long standing collaborative research in soft x-ray  spectroscopy by means of synchrotron sources using the techniques  of   soft  x-ray  fluorescence  (SXF)  spectroscopy,  soft  x-ray  absorption  (SXA)  spectroscopy,  and  soft  x-ray  photoemission  (SXPS) spectroscopy.  Three areas are targeted for investigation:  1) SXF and SXA will be used to study compounds containing 4d, 5d,  and  4f  elements;  2)  New experiments  combined  with  a  major  emphasis  on theory will be directed to the study of SXF  spectra  excited  near  threshold which must be described  as  a  resonant  inelastic x-ray scattering process; and 3) SX spectroscopies will  be  used  as  deep probes  for the study of bulk properties,  and  buried  structures  and interfaces, and to  explore  the  use  of  standing  wave  patterns  in x-ray reflecting  multilayers.   The  understandings obtained through these studies have bearing on the  problems    of   high   temperature   superconductivity,    giant  magnetoresistance,   and  piezoelectric,   electrostrictive   and  magnetostrictive effects, as well on the electronic properties of  matrix isolated nano-particles, the properties of interfaces  and  impurities  isolated  at interfaces in multilayer  systems.   The  facilities of the Advanced Light Source at the Lawrence  Berkeley  National Laboratory and the CAMD light source at Louisiana  State  University will be used in this research.   %%%  The  Focused Research Group composed of six scientists from three  universities   T.A. Calcott, Tennessee; D.L. E derer,  Tulane;  A.  Moewes,  Louisiana  State  and three national laboratories   E.L.  Shirley,  National  Institute of Standards and  Technology;  R.C.

Among  the  areas  targeted  for investigation are the study of compounds containing  elements  which are characteristic components of those  materials  that  are  currently  at  the  forefront  of  investigations   to  ascertain  their  suitability in advanced technological  devices,  the  study  of bulk properties, buried structures and interfaces,  and  the exploration of  the use of standing wave patterns in  x-  ray  reflecting multilayers.  The understandings obtained through  these  studies  have bearing on the problems of high  temperature  superconductivity,  giant magnetoresistance,  and  piezoelectric,  electrostrictive and magnetostrictive effects, as well as on  the  electronic properties of matrix isolated nano-particles, and  the  properties of interfaces and impurities isolated at interfaces in  multilayer systems.  The facilities of the Advanced Light  Source  at  the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the CAMD  light  source  at  Louisiana  State University  will  be  used  in  this  research.  In addition to the named principal investigators there  is  a  large number of collaborators from other universities  and  research   institutions,  including  undergraduate  and  graduate  students   and   post   doctoral   research   associates.   These  collaborations  insure the wide dispersal of the results  of  the  research  to  other  research groups in  industry,  academe,  and  national laboratories, and serve to train the next generation  of   research scientists.  ***",
