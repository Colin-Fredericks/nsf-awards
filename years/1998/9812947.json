 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)   project is co-supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program   and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.  This workshop is   designed to bring together participants from both academic and industrial   institutions for the formation of a regional environmental research   consortium.  Representatives from five colleges and universities (Fisk   University, Middle Tennessee State Universisty, Tennessee State   University, Tennessee Technological University, and Vanderbilt   University) and local industry (including Eckenfelder Engineering and   DuPont) will learn about similar consortia which have been successful in   stimulating collaborative research efforts.   `Action Groups` will be   established to provide focus in the areas of water pollution, air   pollution, and health effects and public policy.  A framework for   collaboration between the academic institutions (including both   predominately undergraduate institutions and HBCUs) and local industries   is seen as having advantageous outcomes for the Middle Tennessee region.    These sorts of partnerships are ideally suited for participation in the   NSF-GOALI program.    The nature of environmental research dictates that multidisciplinary   approaches must be utilized.  The workshop dedicated to the establishment   of a Middle Tennessee Environmental Research Consortium brings together   researchers from different academic institutions and industrial interests   having a wide variety of backgrounds.  The establishment of `Action   Groups` focused on topical areas of interest will provide a framework   which should encourage meaningful collaboration of benefit to the   institutions, companies, and the people of this region.",
