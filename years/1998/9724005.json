 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports US-France cooperative research aimed at the development   of new visualization techniques for the interactive manipulation of urban data.  Efficient   visualization of 3D urban scenes is important for a number of applications, such as the   evaluation of construction and renovation projects, civil and military simulators,   navigation helpers for automobiles, virtual tourism and education, climate and   environmental studies, and city development planning.   The project involves the research groups of Julie Dorsey of the Massachusetts Institute for   Technology and Francois Sillion of the French National Institute for Research in   Informatics and Applied Mathematics (INRIA), Grenoble, and will support exchanges of   researchers and graduate students.  The US investigator brings to this collaboration   expertise in architectural visualization, lighting simulation and design for very large   datasets, image based rendering, and urban modeling.  This is complemented by the   French investigator's expertise in hierarchical modeling and rendering, efficient data   structures for geometric reasoning and visibility studies, advanced lighting simulation and   high performance visualization using mixed image-based and 3D-based rendering.                                                     /% \u2551\u255d?\u2502\u00c1\u00a2\u00a2\u00c1\u00a2   \u00bf> \u00a5\u00a9\u2563\u00a2 \u255d\u00c1\u00a2\u00c1/\u255d\u2502\u00a9  >\u00c1\u2534   \u2502?_\u2551?\u2510>\u2524\u00a2 \u2563> \u00a5\u00a9\u2563\u00a2 \u00c2/_\u2563%` \u2534\u2563%% \u2593\u00c1 \u2551\u255d\u00c1\u2551/\u255d\u00c1\u2524 \u2563> ?\u255d\u2524\u00c1\u255d \u00a5? \u00c1\u252c\u00a5\u00c1>\u2524 \u00a5\u00a9\u00c1   \u2510\u00a2\u00c1\u00c2\u2510%>\u00c1\u00a2\u00a2 ?\u00c2 \u00a5\u00a9\u2563\u00a2 \u2563>\u00c1\u252c\u2551\u00c1>\u00a2\u2563\u2514\u00c1 \u2502%/\u00a2\u00a2 ?\u00c2 _/\u00a5\u00c1\u255d\u2563/%\u00a2",
