 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730577  Webb    This is a condensed matter physics project that investigates  the  quantum  mechanical  properties  of  electron  transport  through  submicron conductors. In these very small structures the phase of  the  wavelength  of  the  electron wave  function  are  important  variables  that  are  probed by a variety of subtle  experimental  arrangements. The project will systematically explore  the  phase  coherent transport properties of mesoscopic system on time scales  much shorter and much longer than the phase coherence time. State-  of-the-art   dc  superconducting  quantum  interference   devices  (SQUIDs)  will  be  used  to study the  size  dependence  of  the  magnetic  response of both single and arrays of metal rings.  The  object  is  an  understanding of  why the persistent  current  in  phase  coherent loops appears to have quantum fluctuations  which  are  orders  of  magnitude  larger than  expected.  In  addition,  magnetic  and  transport properties of mesoscopic  systems  whose  size  approaches  that  of  the Kondo screening  length  will  be  studied.    The   project   provides   exceptional    educational  opportunities for graduate students and post-doctoral associates.  They  are involved in intellectually challenging research at  the  frontiers  of  condensed matter physics. The experiments  require  the  latest  fabrication and measurement methods and prepare  the  students for a wide range of scientific or technical careers.  %%%  This is a condensed matter physics project that employs state-of-  the-art   micro-fabrication  methods   to   prepare   ultra-small  structures.  Much  of  the work is focused on  understanding  how  electrons  flow  through  the nanoscale structures.  Conventional  ideas  of  current  flow  do not apply, and  the  wave-mechanical  properties  of the electron dominate the response of currents  in  loops,  arrays  of  loops,  films,  etc.  The  project  addresses  currently unsolved problems in the quantum mechanical behav ior of  the nanostructures. These problems are relevant to those involved  in the microelectronics industry where the size of transistors is  steadily  decreasing  to  the so-called  mesoscopic  realm  where  quantum mechanics becomes important. An additional project  deals  with  the  properties of nano-wires containing magnetic  impurity  atoms.  The  impurities  influence  the  electron  transport   in  surprising  and  poorly  understood ways.  The  project  provides  exceptional  educational opportunities for graduate students  and  post-doctoral  associates.  They are involved  in  intellectually  challenging  research  at  the  frontiers  of  condensed   matter  physics.  The  experiments  require the  latest  fabrication  and  measurement methods and prepare the students for a wide range  of  scientific or technical careers.  ***",
