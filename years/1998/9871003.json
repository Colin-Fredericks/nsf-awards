 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support to complete the  establishment of the first GIS (Geographic Information  Systems) Training and Research Center in Southeastern Idaho.  GIS provides users with the ability to acquire, organize,  manipulate and analyze spatial data through the use of  computer systems. Or, more simply, data are collected and  plotted onto digital \"maps,\" where it can be analyzed, or  manipulated in modeling exercises. Very accurate spatial  data are obtainable, to within +/- lcm, through  triangulation with geostationary satellites. GIS technology  has a wide array of research applications, including such  fields as Archeology, Anthropology, Biological Sciences,  Geology, Ecology, and many more. In many fields, training in  GIS technology is becoming a competitive requirement for  graduates seeking jobs.       At the same time, southeastern Idaho is an ideal  laboratory for both researchers and students to learn the  applications of GIS. Idaho, as a state, is very concerned  with environmental issues, and protecting its natural  resources. It has remarkable geographic diversity, including  the Snake River Plain Hot Spot Track and one of the deepest  canyons on the North American Continent. It also has the  largest designated wilderness area in the lower 48 states.  As a result of these and many other factors, Idaho is  extremely rich in biodiversity, and much of it is relatively  untrammeled by humans. All of this diversity -physical,  biological, environmental--requires study if protective  measures are to work.         The equipment obtained through this award will  increase research opportunities for Idaho State University  Faculty, Graduate and Undergraduate students from a wide  range of fields. It will also be heavily utilized by  business, industry and government agencies and organizations  (from the local level to the federal). The center will be an  important tool for the study and maintenance of Idaho's  natural environment.",
