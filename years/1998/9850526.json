 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal describes a new approach to teaching the principles of cellular metabolism to introductory biology students in the laboratory setting. It involves the use of Vernier probe systems and notebook computers to allow real-time data acquisition and analysis. The objective of this project is to move away from \"cookbook\" lab exercises and directly involve students in both experimental design and data collection. We feel that this approach will increase student participation in and enjoyment of lab sessions and we predict improvement in the students' understanding of metabolism as measured by departmental examinations. We also hope to increase student retention in introductory courses and to improve the students' chances of success in the more advanced courses offered by the department. In the proposed laboratory sessions students will design and carry out experiments to answer questions related to enzyme function, cellular respiration, fermentation and photosynthesis. They will be required to make use of the scientific method and to explain their experimental design and results to others through in-class presentations, thus giving the students an active role in learning these difficult concepts.",
