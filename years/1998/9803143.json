Severini  Institution:     Northwestern University  Project:         Likelihood Methods in Statistics    Abstract:    This research considers several problems regarding likelihood-based  statistical inference.  These problems naturally fall into two areas.  The first area is inference based on the likelihood ratio statistic.   The research considers the development of an adjustment to the   square-root likelihood ratio statistic that improves the accuracy of  the usual normal approximation and is easily calculated in a wide  range of models.  This leads to improved methods of inference in  models where the accuracy of first-order asymptotic approximations is  questionable. The research also studies analogues of the likelihood  ratio statistic that are based on a quasi-likelihood function. The  second area of research is statistical prediction analysis.   The  specific problems being considered include  the development of   general methods of prediction based on predictive pivots and  conditional inference, and the analysis and comparison of predictive  likelihood methods, including the predictive density based on a  prior distribution.      This research is concerned with the development of accurate and   useful methods for drawing conclusions and making predictions based  on observational data. Many statistical methods are based on  approximations; in many cases, the accuracy of these approximations  is questionable.  One aspect of this research is the development of  more accurate and reliable approximations of this type. Statistical  prediction analysis is concerned with the problem of predicting  future events based on currently available data.  Predictive methods  have applications in a wide array of fields, including medical  diagnosis, environment and global change, manufacturing, and   economic forecasting. This research develops general methods of  constructing pre dictions and  studies the relationships among the  various methods of prediction.",
