 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mark Schell is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program to study the theoretical and experimental   nonlinear behavior in electrochemical oxidation of alcohols.  The   nonlinear kinetic processes to be studied are the electrochemical   oxidations of alcohols in acid solution under the condition of constant   current.  Two fundamental problems will be addressed: 1) the   investigation of the fundamental chemical steps underlying temporal   instabilities during the elcetro-oxidation of methanol at a Pt electrode;   and 2) the development of new techniques for describing nonlinear kinetic   problems that are global in parameter space and phase space.  Much of the   proposed experimental work will center on the instabilities in the   electro-oxidation of methanol.  Preliminary experimental work has shown   this system to be tristable.  The PI will attempt to model this behavior   by theoretically deriving the potential vs. current curves and   oscillatory nonlinear behavior.  The proposed work has practical implications with regard to the   commercial feasibility of an ambient-temperature, methanol-air, fuel cell",
