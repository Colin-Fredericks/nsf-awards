 "awd_abstract_narration": "Janson  9800679    Unlike mammals and birds, embryos of many turtle species can  develop into either sex, depending on the temperature at  which they are raised.  As a rough rule, high temperatures  during a particular sensitive period induce differentiation  into females and low temperatures induce males.  The purpose  of this proposal is to model temperature-dependent sex  determination of the endangered Amazonian Giant River  Turtle, Podocnmeis expansa.  Unlike previous efforts, this  new model will include natural fluctuations of temperature  as experienced in the field, as well as controlled  laboratory experiments.    The following specific experiments will be conducted:  1)  Artificial incubation at constant temperatures; 2) Shift-one  and shift-twice experiments, where eggs are transferred from  female to male-producing temperatures and vice versa; 3)  Seminatural incubation at different depths and shade  conditions, and natural incubation.  With these experiments  the PIs will determine the relationship of sex ratios to  temperature, the timing of the temperature-sensitive period  of development, and the effects of fluctuating temperatures  on sex ratios.  The PIs will propose that the single  variable underlying all these relationships  is the amount  of heat accumulated by the end of the sensitive period.  The  PIs will measure accumulated heat under different  experimental and natural incubation regimes and relate this  variable to rate of development and hatchling sex ratios.  The results should provide a model that explains sex-ratios  in nature for turtles in general, and will be useful in  designing management plans for this endangered study  species.",
