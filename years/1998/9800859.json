 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800859  Thunder    The objectives of this project are twofold. First, the PI hopes to complete work in progress on estimating the number of solutions for non-degenerate quartic norm form inequalities in three variables. The results would be similar to those obtained recently by the PI for cubic Thue inequalities. This will use recent advances in Diophantine approximation, in particular new estimates for a quantitative version of Schmidt's subspace theorem, and estimates for volumes associated to decomposable forms proved by the PI and M. Bean. More substantially, the PI hopes to extend his work on cubic Thue inequalities to forms of higher degree. This will entail a deeper investigation into rational approximations of algebraic numbers and possibly a reformulation of a quantitative version of Roth's theorem. Ultimately, it is hoped that the methods thus developed will yield fairly sharp estimates for the number of solutions of general non-degenerate norm form inequalities. Second, the PI will attempt to prove an \"effective\" version of the absolute Siegel's lemma. He also hopes to find improved bounds for the absolute Hermite constant and investigate possible connections to sphere packings, finite groups, and error-correcting codes. The methods to be employed include standard Euclidean and adelic geometry of numbers.       This research falls into the general mathematical field of number theory.  Number theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers,  addressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one  whole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics and  was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. However, within  the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in diverse  applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and  communication systems.",
