 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Curt Wittig of the   University of Southern California in his continuing studies of   photoinduced reactions.  He will focus on two sets of experiments:  (a)   reactions in the restricted geometries of dimers and (b) unimolecular   reaction rates at threshold.  In the former, he will use double resonance   techniques for cluster size selection.  Rotationally resolved states of   clusters will be selected and their photochemistries interrogated.    Wittig will study the hydrogen exchange reaction and inelastic scattering   in HF-HCl, HCl-HF and HCl dimer and its deuterated analogs.  The second   set of studies will focus on nitrogen dioxide, HNCO, water and HF.    An underlying theme of these studies is to challenge theoretical modeling   by providing benchmark data.  Thus, in some cases, existing models of the   associated gas phase phase processes will need to be reconsidered.  In   other cases, systems are studied for which the dynamics are believed to   be known for the associated gas phase processes.  The cluster experiments   to be carried out here will then display effects attributable to the   restricted entrance channel, i.e., effects due to the geometry of the   cluster.  Such work starts to bridge the gap between the gaseous and   condensed phases at a high level of precision, again with experimental   benchmarks, albeit in a microcosm that is neither the condensed nor gas   phase.   Results from these investigations will thus have a very   significant impact in advancing our knowledge and understanding in   reaction dynamics.",
