 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810012  Wallace  Structural walls/cores are commonly used to provide lateral  strength and stiffness in regions of moderate-to-high seismic  risk in the United States.  For taller building, story deep  trusses at one or more locations over the height of the buildings  are commonly used to couple the core walls and the perimeter  frame.     The behavior of hybrid/composite walls systems depends primarily  on the behavior and modeling of the core walls, the steel frame,  and the foundation, as well as the interaction between these  systems.  A Thorough understanding of each of these system  components is required before reliable design requirements can be  drafted.    Experimental research for hybrid wall systems (HOISE) involves  large-scale testing of T-shaped walls subjected to reversed  cyclic lateral loads and axial load will be conducted.  The  analytical component of the research involves evaluation and  development of inelastic modeling options for HOISE.  Analysis  modules will be created and documented for use with any  analytical platform.  The objective is to develop tools that can  be integrated into a variety of applications/programs without  major modifications.  The models, as well as other models  required to conduct complete building studies will be implemented  into a general purpose program for the final phase of the  research.  Finally analytical studies of complete building  systems to study element demands and core wall - frame  interaction and system studies to assess the economics of using  HOISE in regions of high seismic risk will be conducted.    The project is supported under the fourth year competition NSF-  94-154.  ***",
