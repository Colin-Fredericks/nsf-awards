 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of the Chemistry Division, Tomas Baer will use resonance enhanced   multi-photon ionization spectroscopy (REMPI) of jet-cooled molecules to   investigate the ultraviolet spectra and conformational equilibria of ring   and open-chain molecules such as ketones, ethers, and hydrocarbons.    Temperature-dependent spectral data will yield conformational enthalpy   differences which can be compared with values from calculations.    Gas-phase measurements will be related to solution studies via solvent   effects.  Vibrational relaxation-isomerization rates in the supersonic   expansion will be modeled using the master equation.  The accurate   measurement of interaction energies will provide valuable information   about the nature and strength of non-bonded interactions of alkyl groups   in organic molecules.  Many molecules have flexible structures, where the overall positions of   atoms can vary significantly without breaking or making any of the strong   chemical bonds that connect the atoms.  The many forces exerted among   different regions of a molecule that are much weaker than chemical bonds   can strongly influence the overall arrangement of atoms in the molecule.    For large molecular systems (such as biological molecules), the   collective effect of these small forces can play a dominant role in   determining the structure, and thus the functional behavior, of the   molecule.  These studies will explore the nature of some of these weak   interaction energies.  Results from this project could help to refine the   data bases used for computational predictions of properties of large   organic molecules.",
