 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human beings are subjected to a vast barrage of sensory inputs.  Typically, however, we attend to only a tiny subset of these inputs; our awareness and later memory of sensory events is mostly confined to this subset.  While research has revealed something of how the brain's selection processes works, this knowledge is largely confined to artificial tasks in which people are explicitly instructed to attend to arbitrarily defined classes of stimuli.  The present studies will explore mechanisms and principles that govern the spontaneous allocation of visual attention in the absence of such specific task demands, or in some cases, even work in opposition to voluntary task goals.   One set of studies will examine the finding that visual inputs related to the contents of short-term memory automatically receive attentional priority, even when the individual attempts to prevent this.  Other studies will examine the commonly observed tendency for an individual's own name to draw his or her attention; the limitations and causes of this phenomenon will be explored.  A third set of studies will examine the effects of stimulus novelty, while the final set will examine the tendency of emotionally salient stimuli to draw attention. The time course of emotional effects on attention will be examined in much finer detail than previous work has allowed.  The overall results should provide a broader and more realistic picture of how visual attention is controlled, and help identify processes that affect human performance in a variety of real-world tasks.  Better understanding of these phenomena should prove useful in design of systems requiring rapid and accurate responses from people (e.g., airplane cockpits) and may have implications for eyewitness memory as well.",
