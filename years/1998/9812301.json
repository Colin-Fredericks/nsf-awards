 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-12301  ZECEVIC     The main task of functional neuronal networks is to process  information and that task depends critically on how exactly  signals are integrated by individual nerve cells that are often  anatomically and functionally complex. The principles of  information processing in single neurons can only be determined by  studying specific neuronal types in different experimental  preparations. Conventional studies of information processing in  individual neurons are limited to electrical recordings from one  or two locations. However, regional electrical properties of  neurons and their processes are complex, dynamic and very  difficult to analyze in the absence of detailed measurements. To  achieve better spatial resolution it is necessary to turn from  direct electrical recording to optical measurements. Recent new  developments carried out on invertebrate neurons, now permit  monitoring membrane potential transients simultaneously at many  sites by a special type of optical recording with voltage-  sensitive dyes. It is of considerable interest to apply this  technique to dendrites of vertebrate CNS neurons in brain slices.       The long-term objective of this proposal is to advance our  knowledge about the logic of information processing in individual  neurons from the vertebrate brain using multiple site optical  measurements of membrane potential. The first specific task is to  apply voltage-sensitive dye recording methodology, as developed  for invertebrate neurons, to vertebrate neurons in a brain-slice  preparation. Apart from our preliminary experiments, there is no  previous experience in this field. To achieve this goal it is  planned to: a) integrate the patch-clamp technique that utilizes  infra-red (IR-DIC) video microscopy with the apparatus for fast  voltage-sensitive dye recordings based on a 464-element photodiode  array and b) optimize the intracellular staining protocol using  patch pipettes. The experiments in the next phase will focus on  hippocampal CA1  pyramidal nerve cells. The main goal is to  determine the functional significance of active propagation of  action potentials into the dendrites. A particular aspect of this  question will be examined, for which multisite optical recording  is uniquely well suited. It is important to test the hypothesis,  based on computer simulation and indirect experimental evidence,  that the dendritic excitability and dendritic action potential  amplitude can be selectively modulated in a limited region of the  neuron (particular dendritic branches). Such local changes in  excitability would functionally subdivide a neuron. The idea is to  monitor optically the main dendritic branches of a pyramidal  neuron under control and experimental conditions (local,  synaptically-evoked subthreshold depolarizations) that are  hypothesized to result in local and selective modifications of  dendritic excitability and action potential amplitude. The  experimental results will be analyzed and interpreted using a  biophysically realistic computer model. Results from these studies  will have important implications for synaptic plasticity and some  forms of associative learning.",
