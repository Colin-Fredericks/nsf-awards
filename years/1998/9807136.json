 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Knyazev      The kinetics and mechanisms of elementary reactions of chlorine and hydrogen atoms with chlorinated hydrocarbons is studied over a wide range of temperatures (300-800 K).  A discharge flow - resonance fluorescence (DF/RF) apparatus is constructed for this purpose.  Resonance fluorescence is chosen as the detection method because of its sensitivity and selectivity in detecting atoms.  Use of the RF/DF method makes it possible to isolate the reactions under study and to separate them from possible complications such as secondary atom-radical reactions.  The experimental kinetic results are analyzed using a transition-state/RRKM/master-equation approach to facilitate extrapolation to temperatures and pressures not accessible experimentally.    Use of combustion (incineration) for disposal of hazardous organic waste, including chlorinated hydrocarbons (CHCs), has stimulated interest in the kinetics and mechanisms of this process.  The reactions of chlorine atoms and hydrogen atoms with the principal CHC compounds - the subject of this study - are among the most important and sensitive reactions involved.  These reactions have relevance to chemical processing and flame inhibition/fire retardancy as well.",
