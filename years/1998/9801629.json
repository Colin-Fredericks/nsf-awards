The goal is to develop families' skills in learning as a team through science, math and technology (SMT) in an environment where parents and children are co-travelers in a world of ideas.  PACCT is disseminated through ten of the Challenger Learning Centers reaching 22,000 families nationwide.  Many of these activities are completed in the home at no cost to the anticipated 12,500 participating families.  Through this network of centers, all types of communities are served in many states.  The activities include Sim-U-Voyages, where family teams work at home; Sim-U-Challenges, where families create a physical model responding to a challenge; Sim-U-Visits, where families hear from scientists and work as scientists in a team solving a problem; and Sim-U-Ventures, which result in flying a mission.  Cost sharing is 8%.",
