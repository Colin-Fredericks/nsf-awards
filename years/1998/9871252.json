 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support and under the direction of Dr. Malek Adjouadi, Florida International University will purchase a Neuro Scan Electrical Signal Imaging ESI-256 Channel EEG/EP system and a smaller interface unit, an infrared eye-gaze tracking development system. The ESI-256 is the first commercially available EEG and evoked potential (EP) system of its kind. It permits simultaneous display of average and raw EEG of all channels and post-processing, source localization and co-registration with three-dimensional data sets such as MRI. The system includes: an ESI Reader Station with optical drive and local area network (LAN) connection to the main ESI system; a Neuro Scan STIM System interfaced to ESI for evoked potential and cognitive event-related potential testing; a Curry Multimodal Neuro-imaging software for integration of EEG/EP measurements with MRI and CT modalities. An infrared eye-gaze tracking system from LC Technologies will be interfaced with the larger system to allow the consolidation of eye-gaze with brain activities associated with readiness potentials.  The goal of the research is to develop an alternative form of brain-computer interface which is driven by the signals generated naturally by the body. It is particularly important for the large number of individuals who are physically limited in their access to computers. In the evolution of human - computer interfaces one hopes to approach the point where humans could use the signals that animate their normal activities to interact with such machines. Though study of voluntary movement commands initiated in the inner structures of the brain and through eye movement, Dr. Adjouadi and his colleagues will work to develop such a system.     - \u00c0- v- +- \u00b1@                 +   _                      \u00db\u00aa\u2593\u00a0\u00d1Oh \u00aa'  +'\u00aa\u25920   \u00dd           +       \u00d5               $       H       l        +       \u00a2       \u2557                       D       h       +                                           R:\\WWUSER\\TEMPLATE\\NORMAL.DOT",
