 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase II project will lead to a full-scale commercialization of a novel technology capable of transforming existing stockpiles of ozone-depleting substances (chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and Halons) into environmentally acceptable and commercially valuable products. The proposed Photo-Hydro-Dehalogenation (PHD) technology exploits a synergistic effect obtained by combining ultraviolet (UV) radiation with a reducing atmosphere.  UV fight promotes chain initiation by carbon-halogen bond cleavage.  Long-chain radical reactions lead to formation of desirable products.  Phase I research has already proven feasibility.  Experimental results with three representative chlorofluorocarbons have convincingly and unambiguously demonstrated that the PHD process can achieve selective and high conversion at a cost of less than $ 1/lb of CFC converted, which is lower than any current destruction technology.  The primary objective of Phase II is to design, construct and employ a pilot-scale prototype for a field demonstration.  To meet this objective, a three-task work plan has been developed.  It includes: (a) bench-scale studies of CFCs and extension to Halons, supplemented by chemical kinetic modeling, (b) design and construction of a pilot-scale prototype, and (c) field demonstration and performance evaluation.  Successful completion of Phase II will ultimately lead to Phase III commercialization.        This process should  lead to a `green` technology for environmentally safe transformation of ozone-depleting substances into commercially valuable products.  The current stockpile of estimated 4.5 billion pounds of CFCs, which poses a serious disposal problem, will become a vital feedstock to produce high value products.  Based on preliminary cost estimates, the existing stockpile which represents a huge environmental liability can be turned with the process into about 4 billion dollars of salable products.",
