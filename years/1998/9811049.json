 "awd_abstract_narration": "Almost 80 billion dollars is spent annually on nursing home care. Long term care costs will continue to rise as the proportion of the U.S. population aged 65 and older increases from 13% in 2000 to 41% by 2040. Policy makers recognize the need to move from a reactive regulatory model of quality assurance to a more proactive one.  This research seeks to understand how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of long term care delivery systems through implementing strategic performance measurement systems and quality management practices. A longitudinal study conducted in partnership with two Minnesota long term care corporations, representing 75 nursing homes, will test the interrelationship between corporate level performance measurement systems and quality management practices at the business unit (e.g. nursing home) level. It will also develop and implement corporate wide performance measurement systems that inform decisions for targeting quality management interventions within their long term care facilities.  A survey for assessing quality management practices in nursing homes will be developed based on the structure of the 1998 Baldrige criteria and 1995 pilot  health care criteria, as well as  informed by research on quality management measurement and input from national long term care experts. The survey will be administered to management and staff in each nursing home prior to implementation of the performance measurement systems and on two subsequent occasions.  Nursing home performance outcomes will be measured using data from the corporations' performance measurement systems. Resident and family satisfaction surveys on resident quality of life and perceived quality of care will augment the performance measurement systems' information. A typology of nursing homes will be developed from the constellation of quality management practices and outcomes.",
