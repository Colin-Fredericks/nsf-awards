 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713481  Gordis  The objective of this proposal is two-fold.  (1) The theoretical  and numerical-solution development of a high efficient, general  and exact integral equation formulation for transient structural  synthesis for large structural FE models with localized  nonlinearities and (2), its implementation in the optimization of  nonlinear transient response of large structural systems.    This research will involve the theoretical and numerical  development of the nonlinear transient synthesis formulation.   The linear formulation has been developed (by the PI) and initial  development of the nonlinear formulation is currently under way.   A full theoretical development of the nonlinear integral equation  formulation will be carried out to include formal proofs of  solution existence and uniqueness for the cases of localized  nonlinear structural modifications, substructure coupling with  nonlinear interconnections, base excitation through nonlinear  elements, and semi-active control.    Subsequently a synthesis formulation will be further specifically  developed as a re-analysis methodology in structural optimization  involving nonlinear transient response constraints (or objective  function).  The optimization development will focus on the  application problems of passive and semi-active isolation for  seismic structural response and mechanical shock.  Design issues  will also be addressed.  ***",
