 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building on its innovation, ALOHA, a connection-free wireless communications technology, this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project from ALOHA Networks, Inc. will investigate the technical feasibility of chip slotting in a general Spread ALOHA Multiple Access (SAMA) data network.  ALOHA Networks plans to (a) determine the practicality of transmitting chip clock phase information for the hub receiver in broadcast mode; (b) formulate algorithms for the use of this information by the remote terminal transmitters; and (c) provide a preliminary design of a SAMA hub receiver which can resolve overlapping chip slotted SAMA packets from multiple transmitters.  The benefits of a chip slotted SAMA network will be simplifying in a major way  the implementation of wideband connection-free multiple access channels while at the same time increasing the multiple access throughput of these channels.   The potential commercial applications of the improved performance characteristics of the ALOHA connection-free wireless data network which the project has as its objective will include wireless Internet access, wireless local loops, video answerback, and large scale wideband Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSAT) networks.",
