 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT                                  Understanding the mechanisms and rates of carbon removal  from surface waters remains an important goal of the Joint  Global Oceanographic Flux Study (JGOFS).  Particle formation  and sinking is an important process for such removal.  Much  of the particulate fraction in surface waters is in the form  of small cells having slow sinking rates.  For these cells  to sink more rapidly, they need to be packaged into larger  particles.  Fecal pellet production by animals provides one  way of doing this; aggregate formation another.  Because  aggregates are the dominant form of sedimenting particles,  understanding the processes that form and destroy aggregates  is crucial for JGOS to achieve its goal.    This proposal will develop models to increase our  understanding of the processes affecting organic matter  export from the surface mixed layer.  To this end, the  models will combine particle aggregation models with  plankton food web models.  Data sets from the JGOFS process  and time-series studies will be used to determine and refine  the ability of the models to predict carbon export.    Data collected during the JGOFS field programs will be used  to refine the models.  Combining the simulation results with  JGOFS field data will increase our understanding of the  processes affecting vertical export fluxes and improve the  accuracy of flux predictions made using the models.  The  results of this work will increase significantly our ability  to accurately describe the movement of organic material from  the surface to the deeper parts of the ocean.",
