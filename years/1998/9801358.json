 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation is to be a comparative study of unionism in coal mining and metals mining in the United States from 1890 to 1917. In coal, the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) grew under conservative, dictatorial officials. In metals, by contrast, socialist unionism developed in the form of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM). This study will seek to show the forces that shaped the divergent political characteristics of these two groups of organized miners who otherwise had much in common. Research will be conducted at the UMWA Archive at Pennsylvania State University and the western historical collection in Norlin Library's archives at University of Colorado, Boulder. Materials at these archives will be analyzed in order to uncover the ways in which conflicts between and within the ranks of the mine owners and mining unions affected union politics in each industry. In focusing on the effects of the strategies that workers and mine operators adopted in fighting these conflicts, this dissertation will attempt to show that union politics are not shaped by objective factors beyond human intervention and will make an important contribution to the understanding of how concrete practices matter in determining the political allegiances of organized labor.",
