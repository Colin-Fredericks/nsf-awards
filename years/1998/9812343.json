 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Kew Marine Laboratory was constructed in 1971-72.  In  addition to the building and its excellent sea-water system,  the laboratory was equipped with essential core equipment,  including a large-capacity water-distilling system, a  laboratory-glassware dishwasher, an autoclave and a liquid-  scintillation counter.  In the subsequent 26 years, the  Kewalo Lab has provided the space and facilities for  outstanding research by resident and visiting scientists and  for graduate and postdoctoral training.  Recent renovations,  at state expensive, have renewed the building structurally,  replaced an aging, PCB-containing transformer, built a new  sea-level pump house for the sea-water system, replaced the  central water-distilling system with a reverse-osmosis  system, and provided hard-wire computer contact with the  main University of Hawaii campus.  This project will worn  out dish washer and autoclave and the outmoded liquid-  scintillation counter, all of which are essential, on site,  to the research activities of all who work at the lab, and  provide computers for a central system that will allow  researchers in the lab to share peripheral hardware and  build a database on occurrence, reproduction and development  of common Hawaiian marine animals.  The redefined goals  statement for the Kewalo Marine Laboratory sets the focus on  \"bio-molecular interactions in coastal environments,\" with  an emphasis on organismal biology, utilizing the most up-to  date technology and molecular approaches to answer questions  on development and recruitment, sensory biology, symbiosis,  microbial ecology, environmental biology,enviromental  biology, population/evolutionary biology, and the effects of  introduced species",
