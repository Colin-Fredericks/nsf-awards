 "awd_abstract_narration": "9808301  Gavin    Myosins are molecular motors that catalyze intracellular linear spatial displacement along actin microfilaments.  Examples of myosin-based motility include the contraction of muscle cells and cytokinesis (the cleavage of a cell into two during cell division).  A wide range of types of non-muscle myosin proteins have been discovered, although the specific functions of the various types or classes of myosins have not yet been fully elucidated.  The Principal Investigator's laboratory recently demonstrated the existence of two new members of the myosin superfamily in the ciliated protozoan, Tetrahymena. These are the first myosins to be discovered in ciliated protozoa.  One of these, Myo1p, is a novel unconventional myosin that may be the founding member of a new myosin class.  The other, p180, exhibits a novel localization to actin microfilaments at the bases of the motile cilia, which raises the intriguing possibility that a myosin might integrate interactions between microtubules and microfilaments.  Tetrahymena is amenable to genetic manipulation and is an excellent experimental organism for studies of protein function in vivo.  The goals of this project are to complete the cloning and sequencing of MYO1, to clone and sequence the cDNA for p180, to identify the subcellular location(s) of these myosins, and to determine their function(s) in Tetrahymena.  Antibodies will be raised against each myosin, based on predicted amino acid sequences.  These antibodies will be used for immunolocalization studies as well as for functional studies.  Function will also be assessed by genomic knockouts.  If myosins are involved in microtubule-microfilament synergy, as for example, regulation of ciliary activity at the level of the basal body, the results of this work may well have implications not only for motility in ciliated protozoa but for ciliary activity in vertebrate cells as well.",
