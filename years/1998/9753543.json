 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Puerto Rico Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation (PR-CETP) is a joint of faculty from sciences, mathematics and education of the six main institutions that prepare over 80% of K-12 science and mathematics teachers in Puerto Rico, in partnership with the Resource Center for Science and Engineering, the Puerto Rico Department of Education and exemplary K-12 schools, the Arecibo Observatory and local industry. The goal of the PR-CETP is to enhance the conceptual understanding of the disciplines to be taught by future teachers as well as their mastery of content specific teaching methodology, in alignment with local and national standards. The PR-CETP will be articulated with the K-12 systemic reform of the PRSSI and the undergraduate reform of science and mathematics education through the Alliance for Minority Participation. Key courses in content and teaching methods will be redesigned following a constructivist approach, incorporating authentic assessment methods and the use of educational technology. Practicum and field experiences in PRSSI and other exemplary schools will be established. A capstone course for students to engage in school-based curricular materials development will be created as well as a course in the principles and methods of scientific research, to promote their participation in research experiences in EPSCoR laboratories. A degree in natural sciences for elementary and intermediate teachers will be pioneered at one of the institutions. Faculty Development will promote the adoption of best practices in inquiry-based teaching methods and cooperative learning. A Collaborative Action-Research Program will promote joint efforts between faculty of science, mathematics and education, teachers and students. Student Academic Support activities will recruit students to pursue studies in areas of shortage of certified teachers, support students with academic difficulties, and provide induction activities to graduates with exemplary teachers as mentors. Academic adm inistrators will develop Institutional Policies for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teacher Preparation- to recognize and value faculty efforts in the continuous reform of teacher preparation programs and institutionalize the collaborative reform. The PR-CETP will impact over 5,000 future teachers.",
