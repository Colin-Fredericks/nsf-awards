 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is driven by recent applications of mathematical  programming to machine learning, data mining, medical diagnosis  and prognosis and include the following problems:    FEATURE SELECTION: This is the problem of discriminating between  two finite sets in n-dimensional feature space by a separating  plane that utilizes as few of the features as possible. A step  function that appears in the objective of a linearly-constrained  mathematical programming reformulation is approximated by a  concave exponential on the nonnegative real line.  This leads to  a very fast iterative linear-programming-based algorithm that  terminates in a finite number of steps. Extensions to minimum-  support solutions of linear systems and complementarity problems  and neural networks with minimal number of hidden units will be  investigated.    CLUSTERING: The clustering problem of determining k centers in n-  space such that the sum of distances of each of m given points to  its nearest center is minimized.  A 1-norm distance is used in  order to formulate the problem as that of minimizing a piecewise-  linear concave function on a polyhedral set. A finite successive  linear approximation algorithm terminates very quickly at a  stationary point which, for breast cancer medical databases, is  extremely useful as a mining tool for distinct  survival curves. Extensions to clustering around other geometric  entities such as planes or convex sets, clustering with feature  selection and applications to knowledge discovery in medical  databases will be pursued.    ROBUST REPRESENTATION: Relations within a database will be  modeled in a manner that remains valid when the database changes  moderately.  A simple linear model shows that if a sufficiently  small error is PURPOSELY TOLERATED in constructing the model,  then for a broad class of perturbations the model will be a more  accurate than one obtained by a conventional zero error  tolerance.  The effect of feature selection within tolerant  training, as well its  use to improve generalization in neural  networks will be studied.",
