 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803880  Productivity benefits and quality improvement have come  about as a result of designing and implementing software at  ever higher levels of abstraction. So called \"executable  specifications\"-high level functional descriptions of  software-represent the current state of language development  for software design.  However, software is rarely  implemented by directly translating such specifications, as  the performance of the resulting product is usually poor. To  remedy the performance problem without requiring human  effort to reprogram a specification as an implementation,  the use of program transformation has often been suggested,  rewriting the specification according to rules that preserve  its meaning but change its form. The technology of  transformational improvement has made progress over a span  of twenty years. Several functional language compilers now  achieve substantial performance gains through the use of  source-language transformations. Many improvements remain to  be made, however. This research will build on recent and  promising results that improve the performance of  recursively defined functions by applying transformations  based upon their underlying mathematics. Prototype systems  have shown the potential of some of these methods, but these  systems have never been fully implemented, integrated, or  tested. In particular, this research will integrate a  variety of known techniques that are expected to work more  powerfully in concert than individually. In this project, a  prototype transformation system will be extended so that it  can be applied to programs written in a core subset of the  programming language Standard ML, as well as in CAML, an ML  dialect widely used in Europe. The research will help to  determine whether high-level transformations can be  effective enough in improving the performance of high-level  specifications that software designers might quit worrying  about many details of programming.***",
