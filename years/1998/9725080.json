In this renewal grant, he is being supported to  devise sophisticated algorithms and to calculate eigenvalues  using quantum Monte Carlo methods.  The specific  applications of these calculations, in statistical mechanics  are in the general area of dynamic critical phenomena,  especially the universal properties.  In quantum mechanics,  the applications are to a calculation of properties of  ground state and also excited states of both bosonic and  fermionic  van der Waals  clusters.  %%%  This renewal grant supports the work of a senior PI well  known for his innovative numerical work on a large number of  problems in statistical mechanics and in quantum mechanics.  The work here contains solutions to specific problems in  both statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics, as well as  development of sophisticated and complex computational  algorithms.  ***",
