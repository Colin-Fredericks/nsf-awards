It has had previous support from the Informal Science Education Program for initial series production and to help expand the series from a half hour formation to an hour-long show.  This grant will enable the World Media Foundation to deepen and strengthen the reporting of the science and technology of environmental change by employing a staff science reporter and a staff researcher with a Ph.D. in biology.  The science reporter will enable the project to respond more quickly to emerging issues, as well as providing more consistent and better prepared science coverage.  The research will help the producers better interpret new developments and studies, help identify new topics, and improve accuracy and balance.       The series also will add the topic of marine environments to their major areas of concern.  There currently is little media coverage of the rapid loss of healthy coral reefs, the collapse of commercial fisheries, and the changing ocean chemistry.  The project will continue to covers such major topics as biological diversity, climate change, environmental toxicology, and agricultural science.     Steve Curwood, the Executive producer and host of Living on Earth, will continue as the PI for the project.  The science producer/editor will be Dan Grossman.  He has a B.S. in physics and a Ph.D. in political science and has taught science journalism at Boston University.  The project advisory committee consists of Arjun Makhijani, Greg Watson, Theo Colborn, Catherine Vandermoer, William Moomaw, George Woodwell, Michael McElroy, Jane Lubechenco, Carl Safina, Sylvia Earle, and Jerry Schubel.  The series is produced by the World Media Foundation in cooperation with WBUR, National Public Radio, and Harvard University.",
