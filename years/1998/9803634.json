The objective of the meeting is to explore current and emerging  approaches to the science and technologies associated with  artificial organs and how the different fields of investigation  interact.  It is expected that new innovative and proactive  interactions will develop among the three specialist groups  participating in the meeting: materials and polymer scientists;  bioprocess engineers; medical professionals.  The young  scientists to be supported by NSF funds will have an excellent  opportunity to engage in such interactions. Persons who receive  support from the award are to submit a letter report to the  Division of Bioengineering and Environmental System on the  technology(ies) with the greatest potential for the development  of bioartificial organs in the next decade.    Publication of a proceedings is scheduled within 10 months of the  conference, thereby making the results of the conference  available to a large audience.  ***",
