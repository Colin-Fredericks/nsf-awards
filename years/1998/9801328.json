One problem involves the principle of functoriality involving the Asai L-functions and automorphic forms on the general linear group of degree 4.  The second involves a conjecture of the famous mathematician from the early part of the century, Ramanujan. The final project is to understand a class of cusp forms over complex multiplication fields with regular infinity type.      One of the most important mathematical ideas of the second half of the century, is that analytic formula  often encodes discrete information. For example, one might want to count the number of solutions of a particular equation, but discover that the solutions are very hard to find. Mathematicians call these kind of problems 'discrete' because you are counting separated things. The functions that appear in calculus, and for which calculus works so well, are not 'discrete', but 'analytic' because they deal with all the real numbers no matter how close together.  Amazingly, the right kind of analytic function can contain the answer a discrete examples.  Actually the first examples of this were discovered a couple hundred years ago,  but in the past thirty years, these examples have been systematized into a branch of number theory called the Langlands program.",
