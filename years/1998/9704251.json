 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will exploit novel photocatalysts for air pollution control using solar energy.  Emissions controls are needed which are cost effective, use energy efficiently, are suitable for remote locations, and produce no hazardous by-products.  Ideally, the technology could be rapidly commercialized to meet an increasingly pressing need.  Photocatalysis potentially has these characteristics, employing ultraviolet (UV) light to destroy contaminants at ambient temperatures.  Photocatalysis would be particularly attractive if an efficient solar technology were available, exploiting inexpensive and abundant UV radiation from the sun.  KSE, Inc. has developed novel photocatalyst formulations which are over 50 times as active as conventional titania photocatalysts.  The efficiency of use of solar radiation in the UV spectrum should be greatly increased by such photocatalysts.  In the proposed Phase II program, the research and development is to be completed by exploiting these unique photocatalyst formulations to capture the potential of solar radiation for the destruction of environmentally hazardous gaseous emissions in air.  The performance of the photocatalysts to be developed will enable effective utilization of solar UV radiation and efficient scale-up to capacities of relevance to practical applications.  The Phase II  program will address selected volatile organic compounds and toxic air pollutants, focused on specific market opportunities.  Solar photocatalytic units will be used to control air emissions from soil and groundwater remediation, industrial emissions control and indoor air quality maintenance.",
