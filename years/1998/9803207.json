Coupled oscillator models may \r\nresult from coupling individual laser devices or from a modal \r\ndecomposition of a multimode laser. For the models under consideration, \r\nthe amplitude of the oscillations is an important dynamical variable; this is \r\nin contrast to limit-cycle oscillators where the amplitude is often slave to \r\nthe phase, hence reducing the dimension of the dynamical system. Thus, \r\neven if the system maintains a desired phase-locked state, amplitude \r\ninstabilities can limit the usefulness of the device in certain parameter \r\nregimes. Also of importance is that the use of lasers as a component of a \r\ncommunications system requires actively modulating the laser output. \r\nDissipation is typically very weak, so excitation can lead to long \r\nundesirable transients or to sustained chaos. Thus, the effect of excitations \r\nranging from periodic to impulsive must be well understood. Finally, the \r\nlaser models are highly singular due to time scales ranging from \r\nmilliseconds to nanoseconds; this provides both analytical and numerical \r\nchallenges in their study. The investigator will apply such tools as \r\nasymptotic analysis, local and global bifurcation theory, and numerical \r\nsimulation and data analysis techniques to investigate modulation effects, \r\namplitude and phase control, and localization dynamics in coupled solid-\r\nstate lasers and multimode fiber lasers.\r\n\r\nCoupled lasers are being used in applications such as space \r\ncommunications, optical interconnects, fiber-optic communications, and \r\noptical beam steering. Some important design goals of coupled laser \r\nsystems are to obtain higher output intensity of the system or achieve \r\nbeam steering. The problems investigated in this proposal will further the \r\nunderstanding of these often unstable systems and lead to the achievement \r\nof control of the desired laser output. Furthermore, wide-ranging system \r\nconfigurations and many different coupling mechanisms (ranging from \r\nnearest neighbor, to non-local, to global) allow this work to aid not only \r\nlaser technology, but also the study of coupled oscillators appearing in \r\nother applications.\r\n",
