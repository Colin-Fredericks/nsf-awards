Field work in northern Greenland and on the Arctic Ocean ice pack is better facilitated by access to Thule Air Base because its northern location shortens the distance over which logistics operations must be conducted.  In addition to use of the building space for logistics staging, the building is also used to house a large equipment pool of Arctic field gear that should be stored and maintained as closely as possible to potential research sites in order to provide ready access in case of emergency requirements.",
