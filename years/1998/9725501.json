The proposed  work addresses factors that control electron tunneling in  systems where charge oscillates coherently in a double  quantum well and far infrared light is emitted.   They will  seek a theoretical understanding of electron (exciton)  tunnelling in these circumstances by deriving the master  equation describing dynamics of an excitation governed by  the spin-boson Hamiltonian in a laser field; solving this  equation analytically and numerically; and exploring the  dynamics of an exciton interaction with acoustical phonons  under the influence of a laser by a direct solution method  based on the Path Integral Approach.  The effects of this  quantum coherence can be potentially used as a source of  coherent microwave irradiation that can be manipulated by  infrared lasers, and a way to control the direction and  magnitude of tunneling photocurrent in GaAs/AIGaAs  heterostructures.    This is a new collaboration that brings together two  outstanding scientists with established strengths in quantum  dynamics, a very active area of research, on a project that  has a potential for basic and applied impact.  ***",
