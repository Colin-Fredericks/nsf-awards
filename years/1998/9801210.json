In terrestrial plethodontid salamanders, a male delivers chemicals  substances (pheromones) to the female during courtship.  These pheromones lead to an increase in female receptivity,  thereby reducing the time a pair spends in courtship.  These  pheromones may also be used by females to determine whether  or not the courting male is a member of her species.  This  possibility will be tested by observing the behavioral  responses of females to male pheromones from different  subpopulations within the same species and from males from  different species.  The behavioral experiments will be  accompanied by chemical analyses of the pheromone components  that influence female behavior.      Many vertebrates rely on chemical signals, such as pheromones, for  communication between potential mates.  Chemical  variation in these pheromones could lead to  discrimination against individuals from different  subpopulations and perhaps lead to complete  reproductive isolation of the subpopulations thereby  contributing to the formation of new species.  The  hypothesis that divergence in pheromones functions to  reduce mating has not been tested in a vertebrate  species and few vertebrate pheromones have been  isolated and identified.  Finally, until now, little  research has focused on the chemical variability in  pheromones or on the relationship between chemical  differences and behavioral effects.  This research  breaks new ground by using the unique opportunity  offered in plethodontid salamanders to investigate  these issues.",
