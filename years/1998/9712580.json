 "awd_abstract_narration": "The area of research is set theory, especially large cardinals  and core models.  Many mathematical principles that have been  shown to be independent of ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with  the Axiom of Choice).  The most famous example is the Continuum  Hypothesis, CH.  Goedel showed that ZFC + CH holds in his  Constructible Universe, L.  Cohen invented the method of forcing  and used it to show the consistency of ZFC with the failure of  CH.    It is natural to consider extensions of ZFC by large cardinal  axioms in order to resolve otherwise independent questions in  mathematics.  Moreover, the collection of large cardinal axioms  forms a hierarchy in terms of relative consistency.  Measuring  the consistency strength of a given principle involves showing  that the principle is equiconsistent with a particular large  cardinal axiom.    Often, Cohen's forcing method is used in obtaining upper bounds  on consistency strength. In the other direction, core models are  analogs of Goedel's L for theories of the form ZFC + ``large  cardinal axiom''.  Beginning with the pioneering work of Jensen,  core models have been applied to obtain lower bounds on  consistency strength.  Important recent advances, in both the  forcing and core model technologies have led to some  equiconsistencies at the level of Woodin cardinals.    Schimmerling will continue his work on pure core model theory,  while at the same time attempting to apply core models to  questions in descriptive set theory, cardinal arithmetic, and  infinitary combinatorics, and, also, to solve some closely  related combinatorial problems using forcing.",
