This proposal consists of various segments  addressing GLOBE Program needs: support for existing  protocols, development of new protocols, and scientific  research with GLOBE data.  This proposal will support the  current set of GLOBE cloud protocols, add a new Relative  Humidity measurement, and continue development of the  teaching materials for both protocols.  This project will develop a protocol for the measurement of  atmospheric humidity, to be taken at the same time as the  daily temperature and precipitation measurements - within  one hour of local solar noon.  This measurement will enhance  the usefulness of the following GLOBE measurements:  cloud  type, fractional cloud cover, quality control of the  previous items.  The project also proposes to provide daily  visible and Infra-red satellite imagery via the Internet  from the GOES-8 and -9, GOMS, Elektro/Fen Yung 2B, and  Meteosat 6 satellites in order to correlate cloud cover  observations with the location of the pixel covering the  observation site.  The direct scientific application of this data will be the  study of the relationship between sea breezes and soil  moisture, air temperature, and water body temperature at  various locations in the tropics and middle latitudes. Where  observations are dense enough, the formation of sea breeze  fronts will be studied.  %%%  In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global  Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program  (GLOBE) this project is designed to meet GLOBE goals and  objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren in a  global information network with the ultimate goal of better  understanding Earth's environment and changes that take  place within it.
