With the goal of strengthening the understanding of the dynamics of the Earth system, the researchers will perform collaborative research on global and regional atmospheric angular momentum fluctuations, and relationships with the fluctuations of the solid Earth motions, especially polar motion.  Topics include: (1) Investigation of the regional influences of atmospheric angular momentum signals from winds and pressure upon polar motion, especially on seasonal and subseasonal time scales including the relationships among different atmospheric regions; (2) Study of related atmospheric-ocean interaction, on subseasonal time scales, relating to rapid fluctuations in polar motion; (3) Study of the impact of El Nino and other interannual climate signals on all components of atmospheric angular momentum, Earth rotation, focusing on polar motion.  They will apply coherence. cross-spectral and similar analysis between atmospheric regions and global polar motion time series will be applied using atmospheric data primarily from a recently completed 40-year Reanalysis analysis for 1958-97.\r\n\r\nThis research in geophysical science fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Poland to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
