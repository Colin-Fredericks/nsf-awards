 "awd_abstract_narration": "Davidson  9707932        Studies will assess the relationship between \"key innovations\"  in  the  digestive  anatomy of ants and the carbohydrate (CHO) : protein (N)  ratios  in  ant  diets.  Experimental manipulations of diet,  together  with  other  investigations, will determine the effects of CHO: N ratios on ant foraging  \"tempos\"  and paths (correlated with food discovery rates), territoriality,  and offensive and defensive chemical weaponry. Stable isotope ratios, % dry  weight  nitrogen measures, and \"giving-up concentrations\"  for  CHO  and  N  resources,  will be investigated as potential indicators of ant  dependency  on  plant  resources and should be intercorrelated. The extent  of  evolved  dependency  of  various  ant taxa on exudates  vs.  prey  will  be  further  assessed in laboratory feeding trials. All comparisons among taxa  will  be  made  in  legitimate phylogenetic contexts. The PIs will also  examine  the  ways  in which other organisms (plants, insects, etc.) may have evolved  to  manipulate ants via the CHON ratios of food rewards. Results should suggest  ways  in  which ant taxa with different diets can be manipulated  by  CHO:N  ratios  in  potential  food  sources. The PIs  should  also  be  useful  in  assessing  the  functional  by  which  some  pest  ants  have  broken   the  evolutionary  trade-off between characteristics leading to  rapid  resource  discovery vs. those correlated with resource domination.",
