 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800192 Al-Sheikhly This is an award to provide support for research on radiolytic dechlorination of polychlorinated biphenyls in sediment, oil and water by use of surfactants, buffers and sonication during the radiation process.  The specific objectives include finding the optimal conditions for use of ionizing radiation for decontamination of soil to prevent migration of contaminants from contaminated sites, decontamination of sediments to reduce their potential for pollution of coastal waters, treatment of contaminated water for industrial and domestic use, and for treatment of municipal and industrial wastewaters to avoid pollution of surface and groundwater.  The marine sediments to be used in this project are sediment standard reference materials obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Technology collected from New York and Newark Bays and from the Patuxent River Naval Air Station.  Oil contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls will be obtained from the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company.  The research will be conducted using electron beam and gamma radiation capabilities at the University of Maryland and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\r\n\r\nResults of this research are expected to assist in determination of the conditions under which radiolysis is likely to be the most cost-effective process alone or in combination with other processes for decontamination of sediments contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls and related organic contaminants of sediments, soil and water. This knowledge will assist in understanding radiation chemistry as it relates to uses of ionizing radiation in addressing environmental problems associated with polychlorinated biphenyls in soil, water and contaminated sediments and provide the scientific bases for engineering design of decontamination systems utilizing ionizing radiation. \r\n***\r\n",
