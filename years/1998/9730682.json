The CDROMs and the activities can be used together, but each stands alone.  Students use the tools of geographic analysis to address intuitively interesting problems in compelling situations.  Extensive use is made of original maps, remotely sensed imagery, and links to relevant web sites and other sources of real-world geographic information.  The CDROM features photographs, interactive maps, and animated explanations of key concepts of scientific geographic analysis.  Weaving together multiple strands of basic locations, place, images, analytical skills, explanatory theories and value issues increases the learning of geographic facts, concepts and skills.  The development team has produced previous materials and has been active in developing the geography standards.  An international steering committee selects case study locations that serve as contexts for activities.  The materials are tested by teachers in state geographic alliances.  Dissemination is assisted by the NASA Education Division.",
