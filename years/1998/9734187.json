 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of affinity transfer   alkylating reagents (ATAR) for labeling the phosophodiester of nucleic   acids.  Using quinone methide chemistry, the ATAR will be agents for the   covalent, chemoselective modification of the phosphodiester group in   nucleic acid polymers.  The educational focus will include the   development of a course to educate journalists, development of a   laboratory course stressing individual creativity and extending this   approach to secondary science education and, developing apprentiship   style laboratory experiments for `real life` problem solving with   community based industry.  With this Faculty Early Development (CAREER)   award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the   research and educational activities of Dr. Kenneth D. Turnbull of the   Department of Chemistry at the University of Arkansas.   Professor   Turnbull  will focus his research efforts on developing innovative,   chemical means to covalently deliver  a variety of reporter groups or   proteins to DNA.  The ability to site-specifically attach such moities to   DNA would allow various genetic based, biological studies to be conducted   and provide a new means for efficient diagnostics, therapeutics and   biological control at the genetic level.  The educational focus of the   project stresses course and curriculum development with an emphasis on   public science literacy, real life problem solving and secondary science   education.",
