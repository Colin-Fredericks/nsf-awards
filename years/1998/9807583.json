 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lips  9807583    Between 1990-97 the PI has observed the sudden and unexplained  decline of the riparian anurans at two remote, protected sites in  montane Central America. Causes of these declines are unknown, but  based on over five years of personal observations, demographic  data, and results of autopsies on dead frogs (by D. E. Green), the  PI hypothesizes that these two declines may be attributed to two  microbial pathogens: a fungus, and a virus. The PI suggests that  these two sites were affected by the same agent as that which  decimated the amphibians of Monteverde, Costa Rica, and that the  sequential disappearance of amphibians at these three sites over  the past 10 years is evidence of a highly contagious pathogen  moving through the Central American isthmus.    The PI will propose to organize a multidisciplinary Rapid Response  and Assessment Team that would attempt to jump ahead of this  apparent \"front\" of amphibian mortality. The team would survey the  health of both the amphibian fauna and the environment to document  the changes in each during a decline. Likely members would include  herpetologists, pathologists, toxicologists, and endocrinologists,  parasitologists, and epidemiologists.  The team would survey these sites in a systematic way to determine  the mechanisms of amphibian  declines by surveying all life stages, measuring environmental  factors thought to cause or contribute to declines, and collecting  individuals for full medical diagnostic evaluations.  The team would determine the geographic extent of this decline in  Central and South America by surveying select upland areas where  declines have occurred, and where declines are expected to occur.",
