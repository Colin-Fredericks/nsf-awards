 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Field Museum's Fossil Invertebrate Collection is  recognized internationally for its vast size and ongoing  significance to research in systematics, evolution, and  paleoecology.  The collection includes about 320,000  specimen lots with as many as 2 million individual  specimens.  However, specimen overcrowding has hampered  efforts to realize the full potential of the collection.  Implementation of the project outlined in this proposal will  result in a better organized, less crowded, and more easily  accessible collection.  The project will successfully  address conservation issues, first by curating much of our  backlog holdings, and second by alleviating crowding of  specimens.  The taxonomic division of this material and the  integration of specimens into a temporal/systematic  framework is viewed as the most practical and scientifically  beneficial  manner in which to treat it.  This project outlines the  reorganization and move of the entire collection,  and additional primary curation by staff and visiting  curators for type specimens, echinoderms and Paleozoic  gastropods.  The recent move of paleobotanical collections  to new facilities has provided additional cabinet space more  than sufficient for this need. The curation and  incorporation of the backlog material in collections will  result in effectively \"new\" specimens becoming available to  the scientific community.",
