 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to infuse technology into the psychology curriculum to   (1) develop scientific thinkers who use analytical thinking, critical thinking, collaborative thinking, and concept development,   (2) create an opportunity for students to conceptualize and conduct their own research, using the technological tools of scientists in the field of psychology, (3) create excitement and enthusiasm for the scientific process.     At the University of Central Arkansas, each psychology major takes a sequence of three courses that provide the scientific foundations for the field of psychology: Psychological Statistics; Experimental Psychology, and Experimental Psychology Laboratory. The proposed curriculum changes will involve active learning of the scientific process by making a research laboratory an integral part of each of these courses. Specific learning objectives include:   (1)  better understanding of the underlying theoretical constructs of statistics (through the use of visual-modeling software),  (2) analysis and data interpretation skills (using statistical software),   (3) skill in using software to graph and visualize results,   (4) understanding of the basic principles of research design,   (5) developing research ideas and hypotheses,   (6) conducting a literature search using digital technology,   (7) understanding classic research studies by using modem technology to replicate them,   (8) using software to program experiments and collect data, and   (9) methods of organizing and disseminating research findings (through the use of technology).     In other words, students will learn the scientific process by doing what scientific researchers are actually doing and by using the technological tools that are actually being used.",
