 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crystal  plasticity  based models and simulation  tools  are  developed  for  bulk deformation processes  involving  large  deformations  in  both low stacking fault energy  (SFE)  fcc  metals  as  well  as  in  hcp metals  with  good  predictive  capabilities for both the anisotropic stress-strain response  as well as the averaged crystallographic texture. a-brass (a  low  SFE  fcc  metal)  and commercially pure  titanium  (hcp  metal) are used as model materials for the study. The  study  has  a  strong  impact on the metal working industry  as  it  provides  predictive  tools that yield  a  large  amount  of  quantitative information on microstructure evolution  during  deformation.  The  microstructural state of  a  material  is  important  as  it plays a governing role in shape  and  size  control  during deformation processing, structural integrity  of    the    produced   component,   and   its   performance  characteristics in service.",
