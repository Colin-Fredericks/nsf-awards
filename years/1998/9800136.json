 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800136  Bergman  This   award   focuses  upon  the  dynamics,   control   and  reliability  of short span highway bridges,  many  of  which  have  experienced a sharp decrease in expected service  life  due  to  loading  induced by heavy truck traffic.   Some  of  these  bridges are approaching the end of their useful lives  and  will require extensive rebuilding or replacement unless  alternate, preferably less costly, ways are found to  reduce  stresses  and  strains that arise from traffic  loads.   The  project  examines several aspects of this problem, including  the  development of high resolution control-oriented  models  that account for important effects such as vehicle-structure  dynamic  interactions,  bridge and  roadway  condition,  and  traffic  intensity, as well as identification and evaluation  of  candidate  intelligent response reduction  schemes  that  work   primarily   through  tuning  of  individual   vehicle  suspensions and bridge parameters.  The problem  embodies  a  number  of  components particularly related to  problems  of  scale  and  structure and to interplay between  computations  and  data.   Among  the former, the dynamic  interaction  of  potentially  many  vehicles with  the  bridge  under  highly  variable  traffic conditions, with concurrent adaptivity  of  individual  vehicle suspensions prior to entering  and  even  while  on the bridge, represents an extreme case of multiple  scales  in  both space and time.  The latter is, of  course,  highly   contingent  upon  remote  sensing,  communications,  adaptivity, and assessment, all in real time, and represents  a real challenge to the computation/data interface.  ***",
