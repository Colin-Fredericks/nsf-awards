 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this project a new computer facility is being developed to: 1) support  the use of multimedia materials at all levels, and 2) provide senior students tools that will enhance their employability.  From a time early in the decade of the 1980s, the department has employed computers to assist students in visualizing the mathematics concepts taught.  However, the department has recently found itself unable to avail itself of modern multimedia tools in instruction, either in preparing students for a progressively more computer-oriented job market or in making the earliest courses more palatable to wary students.  Moreover, students are not using equipment that is even remotely similar to what they will likely use after they graduate.  This project represents an attempt to address this concern.",
