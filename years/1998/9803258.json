 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\n\r\nProposal: DMS-9803258\r\nPrincipal Investigator: Frederick Wilhelm\r\n\r\nFrederick Wilhelm proposes to work on three problems.  The first is a\r\nprogram for creating new examples of Riemannian metrics that have lots\r\nof positive curvatures.  The metrics are on certain fiber bundles.\r\nThe program seems particularly likely to succeed for three sphere\r\nbundles over the four sphere.  Second he will work on proving his new\r\nconjecture---that the dimension of the image of a Riemannian\r\nsubmersion of a complete, positively curved manifold is strictly\r\ngreater than half of the dimension of the domain. Third he will try to\r\ncomplete the classification of Riemannian submersions of round\r\nspheres.\r\n\r\nThe three problems all address the general question of how does the\r\ncurvature of a space effect its geometry and topology?  Roughly\r\nspeaking, curvature is what determines the trigonometry of a space.\r\nFor example one can prove that the surface of the earth is curved with\r\nout looking at it from outer space.  To do this have two people start\r\nat the north pole and travel in any two directions that are\r\nperpendicular to each other. If they travel at the same speed, they\r\nwill eventually meet again at the south pole.  On the other hand, if\r\nthe same experiment were conducted on a flat world, the two people\r\nwould never meet.  They would keep getting further apart, even if they\r\nnever reached the \"edge\" of the world.  The main justification for\r\nstudying this general question is that it seems intrinsically\r\nbeautiful, intriguing, and natural. It has a long history, that dates\r\nback to the 1930's work of H. Hopf, Morse, Schoenberg, Meyers, and\r\nSynge.\r\n",
