Two particular classes of techniques have received much attention: 1) at the physical layer, development of novel multi-user receiver structures which mitigate interference between users; 2) at the network layer, dynamic allocation of resources such as transmit power, bandwidth and bit-rates in adaptation to channel conditions. While the networking aspects for conventional multi-access techniques are well understood, the same cannot be said for problems of resource allocation and power control in the context of these multi-user receivers.     In this project, we propose to establish a coherent framework to study problems of dynamic resource allocation for multi-user receivers in an integrated manner, drawing on information theory as a fundamental basis for performance evaluation.  The specific topics we will study in the proposed framework are: 1) linear multi-user receivers: system capacity under optimal power control; 2) optimal resource allocation for Shannon capacity-achieving multi-user receivers; 3) capacity gain from the use of adaptive antenna arrays; 4) impact of multipath fading on achievable capacity; 5) resource allocation for cellular networks with multi-user receivers.    The solution of problems in resource allocation and QOS provisioning in wireless networks requires a marriage of networking and physical layer concepts. With this in mind, my education plan aims to accomplish the more general goal of providing a solid theoretical basis to our students in networking and communications, as well as the more specific goal of highlighting the interplay between networking and physica l layer concepts in wireless networking.  These goals will be implemented by course development in four subjects.",
