In addition to the research report, a more popular report will be produced and disseminated to parents, policymakers, teachers and the media.\r\n\r\nThe study will be conducted using the traditional NAS approach of naming a study committee.  The committee will be comprised of approximately 15 individuals and will include a wide range of expertise, including mathematicians, K-12 educators, researchers and psychologists.  Oversight will be provided by Dr. Rodger Bybee, Director of the CMSEE.  A \"Virtual Commission\" will provide additional oversight.  The commission will be responsible for developing an outline for the study, along with the identification of specific tasks on the timeline.  It is anticipated that the study commission itself will meet five times over the life of the project.\r\n",
