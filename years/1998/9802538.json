 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802538  Cromwell    The International Research Fellow Awards Program  enables U.S. scientists and engineers to conduct  three to twenty-four months of research abroad.  The program's awards provide opportunities for  joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twelve-month  postdoctoral research visit by Dr. Howard Casey  Cromwell to work with Dr. Wolfram Schulz at the  Institute of Physiology of the University of  Fribourg in Fribourg, Switzerland.    Dr. Cromwell will be learning in vivo  electrophysiology techniques in monkeys. This  work focuses on the role of basal ganglia in  the processing of rewards.  Reward processing  is an important aspect of goal-directed  behavior.  It incorporates sensory information  with an individual's physiological state and  associative learning history for the  production of appropriate behavioral output.    The host lab of Dr. Schultz is one of the few  places doing these recordings from striatum in  monkeys.  It may be the only place that  combines this technique with a research focus  on emotional and motivational aspects of basal  ganglia functioning.  This collaboration with  Dr. Schultz will allow Dr. Cromwell to set up  similar recording in the United States.  ***",
