The aim is to develop effective methods for\r\ncomputing Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic manifolds and\r\nenumerative invariants of algebraic manifolds.  The main thrust is a\r\ncontinuing project with E. Ionel on a gluing formula for Gromov\r\ninvariants under the operation of `symplectic connect sum'.  The idea\r\nis to collapse the connect sum to a singular manifold, keeping track\r\nof the holomorphic curves along the way.  Parker and Ionel have\r\nalready obtained a gluing formula in special cases; these imply the\r\nwell-known recent formula of Caporaso-Harris.  A general gluing\r\nformula should be an effective new tool for computing Gromov and\r\nenumerative invariants.  A second part of the project seeks to for\r\nanswer the following question.  Suppose C is curve that is\r\nJ-holomorphic for some non-generic J. If one perturbs J to a nearby\r\ngeneric J', how many J'-holomorphic curves are there close to C?\r\nSeveral well-known problems in enumerative geometry, some solved, some\r\nunsolved, reduce to this problem.  Parker and Ionel have an approach\r\nbased on the `Taubes obstruction bundle' .  The last part of the\r\nproject suggests using modified Gromov invariants to obtain invariants\r\nthat count curves which exist only for special classes of almost\r\ncomplex structures.\r\n\r\nOne of the most basic problems in mathematics is to determine the\r\nsolutions of a system of polynomial equations, and an important first\r\nstep toward that goal is to determine the NUMBER of solutions.  There\r\nis an explicit formula for the number of simultaneous solutions of a\r\nset of n polynomials in n variables.  One can then ask for the number\r\nof solutions for n polynomials in n-1 variables.  In this case there\r\nis a free parameter, so the locus of solutions will be a union of\r\ncurves.  How many?  This question has been systematically studied for\r\n100 years, but only a few special cases were solved.  Then, around\r\n1990, it was realized that these problems can be translated into\r\nsymplectic geometry, and then tackeled using the powerful machinery of\r\nmathematical gauge theory.  (Gauge theory, originally part of physics,\r\nhas been the focus of many very fruitful interactions between\r\nmathematicians and physicists over the past twenty years; it includes\r\nYang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten theory, and String theory).  This\r\n`Gromov invariant' approach led quickly to formulas answering some of\r\nthe original enumerative problems, and there are clear indications\r\nthat there are more to be discovered.  This project is aimed toward\r\nfurther developing the symplectic gauge theory in order to produce\r\nadditional general formulas, and to meld these formulas into a\r\ncoherent theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
