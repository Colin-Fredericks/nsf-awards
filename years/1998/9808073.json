 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop the ability to predict molecular recognition between proteins.  Molecular recognition is determined by the thermodynamics of protein-protein interactions.  These thermodynamics, in turn, are determined by the structures of the proteins, and can be modulated by environmental variables such as pH and the presence of other small ligands.  The thermodynamics of interaction of serine proteases with proteinaceous inhibitors will be studied by isothermal titration calorimetry and compared to the energetics calculated from the crystallographic or modeled structures using empirically based methods which have proven successful in predicting protein stability.  Additionally, the basis of pH effects on the binding will be studied by making site-directed mutations aimed at perturbing the proton affinity of the active site histidine, located in the protein-protein interface.  Finally, the binding of phosphate to the complex will be studied as a function of temperature and pH.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the work is to provide a better understanding of the relationship between protein structure and binding energetics.  It will also improve our understanding of how the protein environment can modulate the pKa of an ionizable group.  Such knowledge is critical to the ability to design proteins with specific molecular recognition and pH sensitive binding properties.\r\n",
