 "awd_abstract_narration": "The college's chemistry and biology programs are being strengthened by the addition of a Hewlett-Packard Gas Chromatograph Flame Ionization Detector/ECD System, an inlet and detector to equip a second GC with FID capabilities, and a High Performance Liquid Chromatograph with diode-array detection capability. The FID upgrade to an existing HP system allows greater student access to FID capabilities, using existing the ChemStation data system and GC. These acquisitions are infusing new technology into existing experiments, adding new experiments to the curriculum, adding HPLC experiments to the Nutrition laboratory program, adding both GC and HPLC work to a Forensics Science Course, and providing appropriate laboratory experiences for the Environmental Science Program at the college. In addition, the new instrumentation is being used for talented high school students and for inservice training of county teachers. Estimated annual use of the instrumentation is 500 undergraduates, 50 county high school students, and 50 county high school teachers. Over 70 percent of these individuals are members of groups underrepresented in science.",
