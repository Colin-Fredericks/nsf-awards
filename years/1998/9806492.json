 "awd_abstract_narration": "9806492  Wagener    This award addresses several specific research goals.  A  series of well defined polyolefin polymers will be designed to  model the crystallization behavior of polyethylene and its  related copolymers, including the new metallocene materials.  The synthesis concept has already been reduced to practice, so  the likelihood of success in this research is high.  This will  be done by implementing total control over the identity and  frequency of branches along the backbone.  Inherent in this  research will be work to elaborate on new homogeneous-to-  heterogeneous metathesis/hydrogenation chemistry.  Well-  defined alcohol and ester branched polymers will be  synthesized to serve as polymeric substrates in a sialyl Lewis  X tetrasaccharide drug binding study.  This work will be done  in collaboration with Prof. Wong of the Scripps Research  Institute.  Precise segmented polymers will be synthesized by  condensation metathesis.  Segmented multiphase materials can  only be made by step polymerization procedures, making the  ADMET reaction a natural choice for this conversion.  This  synthetic strategy has already been demonstrated, and the  preparation of useful hard segments will be explored using  polyether, polysiloxane, and polyisobutylene soft segments.  Well defined, mixed metal rich homopolymers will be prepared  possessing different metals covalently fixed within the same  polymer chain.  %%%  While covalently bound metal containing polymers have already  been synthesized via condensation metathesis, polymers with  such high mixed metal content polymers are not known.  Each of  these areas provides significant opportunity for the training  of postdoctoral, Ph.D. and undergraduate students for their  future.  Interaction with industry continues to be strong, and  the information generated by this work will foster continuing  relations with a number of corporations.  The social impact of  this research relates to broadening the usefulness of the  world's largest volume, commo dity polymers and copolymers such  as polyethylene, polystyrene and polyvinylacetate.  ***",
