This proposal consists of various segments  addressing GLOBE Program needs: support for existing  protocols, development of new protocols, and scientific  research with GLOBE data.  This proposal will support the  current set of GLOBE soil measurement protocols, with the  quality control segment being provided by cooperation with  the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service.  The  project will use GLOBE student-collected data to derive  algorithms for physical and chemical soil system simulation  models, including the Frozen Soil Temperature model (FroST).  The GLOBE soil data will be used to determine baseline  estimates of soil quality within various ecosystems and land  use scenarios.  Seasonal measurements of surface soil  characteristics will assess regional changes in soil  quality.  This proposal will also support the development of  materials for education that will include soil science in  the context of Earth Systems Science.  Scientists, students,  and the general public will be able to better understand the  role of living soil in ecosystems and their role in the care  of our natural resources.  %%%  In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global  Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program  (GLOBE) this project is designed to meet GLOBE goals and  objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren in a  global information network with the ultimate goal of better  understanding the Earth's environment and changes that take  place within it.
