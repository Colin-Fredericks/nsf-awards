For periodic matrix functions of several variables, the positive   extension and contractive extension problems will be studied.The positive extension problem arises in signal processing when spectral estimation of stochastic processes are required. The contractive counterpart arises in   such fields as the worst-case control, e.g., in the model-matching problem.   New support sets with the positive extension property will be identified,   and a description of all solutions (including a maximum entropy solution)   of the respective extension problems will be given. For this purpose, new   versions of the band method, suited for the multivariable setting and   including dual norm results, will be formulated. For finite sets which do   not have positive extension property, numerical algorithms based on the reduction to matrix completion problems will be developed. The results obtained will be related back to their applications.The principal investigators will continue a systematic study of almost periodic factorization. This factorization arises naturally in diffraction theory, distributed parameters control systems, and the spectral estimation problem for a class of stochastic processes. New existence results will be obtained and then used in applications to almost periodic versions of the Corona problem and stable rank one property, Krein's theorem on orthogonal matrix polynomials, the Beurling-Lax theorem and   the geometry of shift-invariant subspaces of the Besicovitch space.   Almost periodic factorization will also be used in the spectral   theory of various operators (including Toeplitz, Wiener-Hopf and other   convolution type operators) with matrix almost periodic and semi  almost periodic symbols on weighted Lebesgue spaces, and in almost periodic   extensions and interpolation problems. Connections with the   respective problems for periodic functions of several variables   will be exploited. New procedures for explicit  almost periodic factorization will be developed and applied to a constructive solution of convolution type (in particular, difference) equations on finite intervals. These results will be further applied in the scattering theory for the generalized Schrodinger equation.    The proposed research aims to develop new mathematical tools and   techniques, motivated by potential uses in diverse areas of   science and technology. A typical application in   medical sciences, seismology, signal processing, or physics involves    reconstruction (as much as available data allows) of the intrinsic   structure of an object of study, given only a few surface measurements.   Statistical applications involve prediction, or prognosis, of a process   in probabilistic terms, when only a brief history is known.    There are currently available mathematical techniques that underlie   many recent technological advances in these areas. However, the   existing techniques deal mostly with the case when there is only one   variable (typically time or distance along a line) involved. The   immense complexity of real-life systems calls for new mathematical   developments, in particular it calls for an extension of the existing   theory to the case of more variables (allowing for instance for planar and   spatial variables). The proposed research seeks to make substantial   contributions in this direction. Interaction and collaboration with many   researchers in different fields is an integral part of the proposal. The   principal investigators also plan to involve undergraduate students in   parts of their research.",
