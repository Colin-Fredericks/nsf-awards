 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humphrey  9727180      The  Symposium  will  bring  together  a  highly  interdisciplinary  mix  of  biologists,  physical scientists (chemists, physicists, mathematicians)  and  engineers  to  present  and  discuss fluid-,  solid-,  them~o-mechanics  and  dynamics  phenomena related to plants, animals, and their environments.  The  length  scale range of interest spans single cells, to entire organisms,  to  their  host  environments, implying length scale ratios exceeding  10'2  and  including     the    extremes    of    micro    (molecular)    and     macro  (atmosphericJoceanographic) forces.    Many  disparate  phenomena are described by a common set of  physical  laws.  They include the breaking of a limb from a tree, the lifting of a load by an  ant,  the  sensing  of vibrations by a spider, the dispersion  of  seeds  or  chemical  pollutants  by  the wind, the flight of  birds  and  insects,  the  swimming  of fish, the transportation of oxygen via blood cells, the  rising  of  sap in trees, the hot chemical discharge from the bombardier beetle, the  solar  radiation  interception by a butterfly's  wings,  the  dispersal  and  sensing  of  pheromone plumes in moths, the locomotion of water striders  on  water  surfaces, filter feeding in marine animals, insect sound  production,  the  mechanics  of  single  cells and their  membranes  and  skeletons,  the  physico-chemicai  properties  of arthropod exoskeletons,  the  mechanics  of  blood  flow  through large blood vessels and in capillaries, the  optima  of  certain  organismal forms in relation to function. This provides  a  natural  way  to  analyze  a  diverse collection of biological phenomena  that  might  otherwise:  appear totally unrelated; a way to find underlying commonalities  among  them,  not in the traditional biological areas, but in terms  of  the  physics that affect them in their environments.",
