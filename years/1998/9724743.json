Dr. Hinds will work with Dr. Shunri Oda, Professor  at the Research Center of Quantum Effect Electronics, on a  research project entitled, \"Novel Single Electron Coulomb  Blockade Transistor as Probe in the Study of the SiO2/Si  Interface.\"    The proposed research will focus on the design of a single  electron Coulomb blockade transistor and will be  specifically directed toward lower gate control voltages  (required for logic applications) and systematic control of  interfacial oxides.  Current research on Coulomb blockade  transistors suggests that the charge of a single electron  (in a floating gate) controls the state of the transistor  (the flow of electrons through the channel).  The proposed  research will examine a novel transistor design that will  allow for variations in interfacial oxides (SiO2/Si) present  at the floating gate, modify the flow of electrons through  the channel, and lower the control voltages that determine  the efficacy of logic operations.  Anticipated results of  the research is the effective utilization of lithography  with feature sizes near 10 nanometers, representing a  significant advance in the scaling down of electronic device  structures.  The results of the proposed research will be  critical to the advancement of nano-scale electronics and  the conventional metal oxide semiconductor (MOS)  fabrication, which is the basis of the present  microelectronics industry.  ***",
