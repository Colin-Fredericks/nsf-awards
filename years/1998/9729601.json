 "awd_abstract_narration": "9729601  Carmichael  The goal of this project is to understand how mRNAs are transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Intron-containing pre-mRNAs are usually spliced and polyadenylated within the nucleus before mature mRNAs are transported to the cytoplasm. Most unspliced mRNAs are not exported. mRNAs transcribed from cDNAs of many intron-containing genes fail to accumulate in the cytoplasm, but some cellular mRNAs are intronless yet are transported efficiently. A 100-bp sequence within the intronless mouse histone H2a coding region has recently been found to permit efficient cytoplasmic accumulation of a human (-globin cDNA transcript. This histone element also inhibits splicing and can functionally replace Rev and the Rev-responsive element (RRE) for the cytoplasmic accumulation of unspliced HIV-1-related mRNAs. Further, this element appears to enhance polyadenylation. Therefore, this sequence may be a member of the cis-acting elements that facilitate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of naturally intronless messenger RNAs. Importantly, this is the first cellular RNA sequence that has been shown to have these properties. To extend these initial studies, a series of experiments are planned. First, the mouse H2a element will be further characterized in a variety of ways, including by site-specific mutagenesis. Second, experiments will be undertaken to identify the trans-acting factor(s) responsible for the transport effect on intronless messages. Third, using a number of different assays, the mode of action of the histone element will be compared both in vitro and in vivo to those of other known transport elements, which derive from viruses. Finally, other mouse histone open reading frames will be screened for sequences that facilitate intronless mRNA transport.    Living cells contain genetic information (DNA), which must be copied into informational molecules (called messenger RNA or mRNA) which is used to decode the information into proteins and enzymes. In order to work correctly, these  mRNAs have to be efficiently transported from one cellular compartment (the nucleus) to another (the cytoplasm). The research planned in this project will help us to understand better how mRNAs are transported. For the first time a cellular mRNA fragment has been discovered which appears to facilitate transport, and this fragment will be characterized in molecular detail to learn how it works.",
