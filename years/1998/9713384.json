 "awd_abstract_narration": "An NSF-CBMS Regional Conference on Wavelet Analysis as a Tool for  Computational and Harmonic Analysis will be held at the  Department of Mathematics, University of Central Florida on May  2-8, 1998.  Professor Ronald Coifman, Professor of Mathematics at  Yale University, will serve as Principal Lecturer of the  conference.  The organizing committee will consist of  mathematicians and scientists drawn from the Departments of  Mathematics, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical  Engineering and Aerospace sciences, the Center for research in  Electro-Optics and Lasers, and the Institute for Simulation and  Training at the University of Central Florida, as well as outside  experts from academic and industrial institutions.  The general  area of the conference's endeavor is of great topical interest  and has seen as explosive expansion of activity in the last ten  years, both in theoretical aspects and in applications of the  mathematical theory to problems in computer science, electrical  engineering, mechanical and chemical engineering, biomedical  engineering and their related areas.  Despite the intense  activity over the past decade, there are still numerous  outstanding issues, many of which are only now coming within the  ambit of modern computational techniques.  Coifman, who is a  consummate lecturer and a major contributor to the area, has a  very broad view of the subject matter, from the mathematical  analysis to the numerical and computational work and even the  engineering and industrial aspects.  He is currently leading a  research program to develop new wavelet based mathematical tools  for future extraction recognition and denoising.  His lectures  will serve to survey and unify major developments in the field,  assessing both achievements and unsolved problems.  Professor  Coifman is an obvious choice to lead a gathering of experts in  this area.",
