 "awd_abstract_narration": "The undergraduate Electromagnetism (EM) course has recently been under attack because 1) there is great curricular pressure to reduce its credit hours make room for new subject areas that may be more useful to the students, this despite the intellectual value of EM and its fundamental role in technology; 2) students complain that EM is perhaps the most complex and difficult course in the engineering program, frequently being more than they can handle; 3) current usage involves only a small subset of the several field quantities that are taught, raising questions about our understanding and presentation.    These problems had no resolution until 1992, when a new theoretical basis was advanced that leads to the computational technique, that involves simplified pedagogy, and that enriches the classical theory. It involves the reinterpretation of EM relations and its novelty is sufficient that its use requires preparation of notes or a textbook for classroom presentation. Strangely this analysis was that proposed by J. C. Maxwell but, as historians of science have noted, his work was transformed through the happenstance of history.    Prof. R.L. Coren, with Prof. C.J. Carpenter, the rediscoverer of this theory, has participated in its development. Primarily he is preparing the necessary class notes. This proposal is to expedite this work, to assist in the new course presentations and their evaluation, and to promote dissemination of the pedagogic method and results.",
