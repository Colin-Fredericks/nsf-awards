In particular,  the   PI   has  discovered  that  autonomic  nerves  control  proliferation and secretion of corticosteroids by the  cells  of  the adrenal cortex.  These autonomic nerves include both  sympathetic  nerves and the chromaffin cells of the  adrenal  medulla.   In  these studies, the PI's propose to  determine  the   mechanisms   used  by  nerves   to   stimulate   these  adrenocortical cell activities.  Four general questions  are  addressed:  (1)  Is  the  cell  proliferation  regulated  by  sympathetic  nerve  activity and by which  neurotransmitter?  (2)  Does the growth factor, bFGF, play a role? (3)  Do  the  chromaffin  cells of the adrenal medulla contribute  to  the  regulation of adrenocortical cell secretion? (4) What signal  transduction  pathway is turned on by  the  chromaffin  cell  activity?    In   order   to  study   the   direct   neural-  adrenocortical  cell interactions, the PIs  will  use  their  recently established co-cultures of nerve and adrenocortical  cells for these studies.  Taken together, these studies will  contribute  to  the overall understanding of  how  endocrine  gland function is controlled and the mechanisms by which the  central nervous system exerts this regulatory function.",
