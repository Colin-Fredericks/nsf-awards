 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract - Lee        This is a study of the interaction of fuel spray mixing and combustion in a lean direct-injection engine.  Advanced optical diagnostics and multi-dimensional modeling are used to characterize in-cylinder fuel/air mixing and combustion in an optically accessible, direct-injection engine.  Optical diagnostics include exciplex fluorescence for visualization of spatial distributions of liquid and vapor fuel under firing conditions, planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) with fuel dopants for visualization of liquid fuel, and phase/Doppler particle analysis (P/DPA) to characterize drop size and velocity of the spray.  In addition, a new planar droplet sizing technique is developed by imaging exciplex liquid fluorescence and Mie scattering signals simultaneously; the ratio of these signals is proportional to the Sauter mean diameter and the technique can be calibrated using the P/DPA measurements.  Computations are performed within the framework of a model for two-phase reacting flows that has been used for comparisons of spray and engine measurements.    The results of this work should provide the fundamental basis for design of a successful lean direct-injection spark-injection engine.  Such an engine is believed to offer improved fuel economy and reduced emissions, but its development has been hampered by poor understanding of the relationships among fuel injection, mixing, and combustion.",
