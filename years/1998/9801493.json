 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9801493  Owen  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project develops, constructs, and deploys a Coastal Ocean Processes Sensor (COPS) array of fiber-optics based sensors.  COPS uses digital holography and wavelet-transform optical correlation to record and analyze ocean particulates.  Identification of the opportunity: Detailed characterization of particulates is central to understanding the subsea environment.  COPS measures particulates at a variety of scattered sites with a collection of holographic sensors linked to a central data processor.  Important applications include the measurement of particle settling velocities and the analysis of bio-geochemical processes in aquatic systems.  Research objective: To build and verify a collection of COPS sensors.  Each COPS sensor records a 3-D field of particulates for wavelet analysis and classification.  Research description: COPS sensors will be constructed, tested, and refined through a series of sea trials.  Several sensors will be deployed in concert to verify the capabilities of a full COPS monitoring array.  Anticipated results: COPS design will emphasize autonomous operation, low-power requirements, and biofouling resistance.  A COPS array should operate in-situ for several weeks without operator attention.  Commercial applications include studies of marine aggregate particle dynamics involving biological, chemical, and physical processes.  Other applications include coastal monitoring, environmental surveying, aquiculture, engineering turbidity, industrial facility monitoring, and underwater lidar.  ***",
