 "awd_abstract_narration": "Linguistic utterances in their phonological aspect are traditionally represented as a con catenated linear string of phonemic segments. Beginning with research by Jakobson, Fant and Halle in the early 1950's, the concept of the distinctive feature was introduced as the minimal unit of phonological description, according to which a phoneme is a simultaneous bundle of bi narily valued phonetically defined features. In that conception, the phoneme is the minimal pho nological unit with temporal integration. The identification of the integral phonemic segment was largely supported by spectrographic discontinuities as observed in acoustic signals, in particular voice onset and offset along with articulatory implosions and explosion of stop consonants. However, the transition from one phoneme to the next is often represented in the speech signal as a continuous smooth spectral change with no apparent discontinuity. A serious challenge to the prevailing phoneme concatenation and coarticulation theory derives from articulatory data largely due to x ray microbe studies. As temporal details of articulatory gestures became avail able,.it was clear that the concept of simultaneity of articulatory gestures which manifest a given phoneme could not be maintained.  From the phonological perspective, there has been a steady intellectual progression from the linear generative theory of phonological representation where issues of articulatory ordering and segmentation were quite simple, to current nonlinear representations where the mapping between segments and features is quite relaxed, and highly articulated suprasegmental structures have been often assumed. A consequence of current nonlinear representational models, which allow single 'segments' to bear multiple values of a given feature, and which quite freely allow a single feature to be associated with many 'segments', is that one can meaningfully question the existence of the discrete 'segment' as a formal object. Indeed, the theory of feature geometry does not explicitly represent the notion of 'segment', and it has been argued that the traditional notion of segment does not correspond to any specific node or level of representation in current models. Nonlinear models have increasingly tended towards positing complex but internally timeless single 'segments' in place of clusters of segments. For example, it has been proposed by Duanmu for Chinese that there are no onset consonant clusters at all, and that such apparent se quences are single secondarily articulated segments ((k) inter alii).  The goal of this workshop is to focus on a particular domain which is central to the theo retical issues of representation, and seeks to evaluate competing theories of that domain, by looking at issues relating to the syllable, and to the 'segment' as a phonological construct. The wide range of theoretical perspectives which exists regarding segments and their ordering renders it difficult to test empirical claims about possible consonant clusters. This workshop will assemble major leaders in relevant areas, to create a forum for up to date dis cussion considering different approaches to these problems.",
