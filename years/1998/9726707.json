The researchers will be  undertaking studies relating to the origin and evolution of  amitochondriate protists.  The main goal of the  collaboration is an in-depth study of the nature and  phylogenesis of single celled eukaryotes that harbor no  mitochondria, functioning as energy conservation systems.  Although mitochondria provide a significant energenetic  advantage to eukaryotic organisms, they are absent from a  number of independent lineages.  According to phylogenetic  reconstructions some but not all amitochondriate protists  represent early branches of the eukaryotic tree.  Recent  research suggests that most if not all amitochondriates  descended from mitochondria containing ancestors.  The  research aims to contribute data and concepts in an effort  to  resolve this central issue of the evolution of  eukaryotic cells.     This project brings together the efforts of two  laboratories that have complementary expertise, research  capabilities and equipment.  The collaboration will unite  the Tokyo group to functional molecular facilities fully  equipped for cultivation of the protists,  enzyme studies  and molecular cloning.  The Rockefeller group will have  access, in Tokyo,  to extensive computing facilities with  high-powered, novel methods of sequence comparison and  phylogenetic reconstruction.  Results of the research should  significantly advance understanding of the evolutionary  history of an unusual but widely distributed group of  eukaryotes.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology,  this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and  promote international understanding and cooperation.  ***",
