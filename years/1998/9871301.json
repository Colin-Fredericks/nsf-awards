 "awd_abstract_narration": "9871301  Banner    This  Major Research Instrumentation Program grant  provides  funds  for  one-half  of  the  cost  of  a  high-resolution,  magnetic sector inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer  (ICP-MS)  for the Department of Geological Sciences  at  The  University of Texas at Austin.  This instrument will be used  in  conjunction with existing analytical clean room and mass  spectrometer  facilities for high-sensitivity elemental  and  isotopic  analysis of rock, mineral, water,  and  biological  samples.   The  high temperature (up to  10,000  K)  of  the  inductive heating and the rapid and complete introduction of  the  sample  to the ionizing environment result  in  a  high  efficiency of dissociation and ionization for most  species.  The  coupling of the high ionization efficiency of  the  ICP  source  with  the  recent  improvements  in  background  and  resolution  afforded by a double-focusing,  magnetic  sector  analyzer,  will  provide  previously unavailable  analytical  capabilities  at  UT  Austin.   These  capabilities  include  detection  limits in the part-per-quadrillion  to  part-per-  trillion  range for many elements, which will open many  new  avenues  to  be pursued in our ongoing research programs  in  reconstructing records of climate change, the development of  sedimentary  basins  and aquifers, mineral  weathering,  and  magmatic    evolution.     These   new    avenues    include  investigations of low-level trace metal concentrations  such  as  the  rare  earth elements in natural waters and  labeled  particles;   high-spatial  resolution  chemical   and   U-Th  radiometric  age data on groundwater mineral  deposits;  the  biological control on mineral weathering; and trace  element  substitution in igneous mineral phases.    It is anticipated that this analytical facility will be used  for  research  and  research training by  faculty,  graduate  students,   and  post-doctoral  research  fellows   in   the  geological, biological, and chemical sciences  at  UT  Austin  and  other universities and research institutions in  Texas.  Currently  funded  and  future research  efforts  will  take  advantage of the new analytical capabilities offered by  the  ICP-MS technology.  ***",
