 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-16612  BEST (COLLABORATIVE with MINAI)      The hippocampus is known to be involved in the performance of  crucial cognitive tasks such as memory and spatial representation.  A very large body of experimental data is now available for the  hippocampus, but the interpretation of these data requires the  formulation of theoretical models for hippocampal function.  This  project applies a computational modeling approach to a very  important but poorly understood aspect of hippocampal function.  Experimental data suggest that representations of place (where an  animal is located with respect to its surroundings) in the  hippocampus are not based solely on sensory features (e.g., visual  cues), but also reflect a cognitive assessment of location. Thus,  two visually identical environments can be identified as different  locations based on contextual information. The computational  mechanism by which this context-dependence arises is not clear.  The present project addresses this issue by building on the  hypothesis that two sub-regions of the hippocampus --- the dentate  gyrus and the hilus --- are crucial to the emergence of context-  dependent representations in the hippocampus.  Over its duration,  the project will comprise four tasks:  (1) Implementation,  simulation, and analysis of an abstract computational model for  context processing in a network based on the gross architecture of  the dentate gyrus and hilus; (2) Implementation and simulation of  physiologically and anatomically more detailed models within a  phenomenological model of the hippocampal system; (3) Experimental  verification of the assumptions underlying the models, and the  predictions derived from them; and (4) Modification of the models  in light of the new experimental data. The aim is to set up a  continuous interaction between theory and experiment that leads to  a better understanding of the hippocampal system.    This project continues a collaboration that Dr. Minai and Dr. Best  have developed over the last two  years under NSF's Collaborative  Research Initiation Program and represents a strong long-term  commitment to theoretical, experimental, and computational  research on the hippocampal system. It is expected that this  collaboration will elucidate critical information-processing  principles in the brain, and also lead to a fruitful application  of these principles in areas such as robotics and intelligent  systems.",
