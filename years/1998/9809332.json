 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst and Dartmouth\r\nCollege jointly propose to perform fundamental research on developing a\r\nfluid simulation methodology that will enable efficient, multi-time-scale,\r\nhierarchical performance modeling of complex networks such as the next\r\ngeneration Internet. The proposed effort will allow networks to be more\r\neasily modeled and their performance to be evaluated significantly faster;\r\nit will make it possible to model significantly larger networks than before\r\nand to allow the tradeoffs between modeling accuracy and solution speed to\r\nbe quantitatively assessed. The novel features of the proposed fluid\r\nmodeling methodology include:\r\n>\r\n>Modeling at multiple time-scales. The proposed unified modeling framework\r\nprovides for modeling system behavior at different time-scales, allowing for\r\nsignificant savings in simulation execution times when modeling at coarser\r\ntime-scales. Development of formal means for quantitatively characterizing\r\nthe potential loss of modeling accuracy when fast-time-scale behavior is\r\nmodeled at a coarser time-scale is an important part of the framework.\r\n>\r\n>Hierarchical fluid modeling. The PIs demonstrate that multi-level\r\n(hierarchical) fluid modeling allows for abstraction of a potentially\r\ncomplex component of the simulation by a simpler model and substitution of\r\nthis simpler model into the larger simulation.  The PIs also develop\r\nrigorous techniques that can automatically identify when such substitution\r\ncan be performed without significant loss of modeling accuracy.\r\n>\r\n>Efficiency in modeling complex systems. The PIs demonstrate that in\r\naddition to providing for multi-time-scale, multi-level modeling, fluid\r\nsimulation can be significantly more efficient than traditional discrete\r\nevent  simulation. The PIs' initial work shows a 50-fold speedup in a\r\nuniprocessor fluid simulation speed over the discrete-event counterpart with\r\nlittle loss in modeling accuracy. \r\n>\r\n>Applicability in many problem domains.  The PIs demonstrate that fluid\r\nsimulation methodologies are ``plug and play'' in the sense that they can be\r\napplied equally well to the current Internet protocol suite, future\r\nreal-time and multicast protocols, or  ATM networks.\r\n>\r\n",
