 "awd_abstract_narration": "Higdon  9803331       The investigator develops improved algorithms for computing  numerical simulations of ocean circulation.  One motivation for  this work is to improve the numerical methods used in the Miami  Isopycnic Coordinate Ocean Model (MICOM), but this work also has  broader application.  MICOM is an operational ocean model that is  currently being tested at Los Alamos National Laboratory and  elsewhere for use in coupled, ocean-atmosphere models of the  global climate system.  This model presently uses a three-level  timestepping scheme that, in practice, requires a restriction on  the time step that is more severe than would be expected from  standard theory.  In addition, the model is affected by a  computational mode consisting of nonphysical grid-scale  oscillations, which are particularly stimulated by the behavior  of MICOM's representation of the oceanic mixed layer.  As an  alternative, the present project investigates methods involving  two time levels.  Such methods have the potential of allowing a  substantially longer time step, require less storage, and do not  admit a computational mode.  These methods are analyzed and  implemented in conjunction with a barotropic-baroclinic time  splitting, which is used to split the fast and slow motions into  separate subsystems that are solved by different techniques.       One application of computer models of ocean circulation is  to aid in the study of the earth's climate system.  For example,  a major point of interest in climate modeling is the poleward  transport of heat.  If the atmosphere and ocean were held  stationary, the tropical regions would be hotter than they  actually are, and the polar regions would be colder.  However,  the movement of the atmosphere and ocean serves to moderate these  extremes.  Roughly half of the poleward transport of heat is due  to the atmosphere, and half is due to the ocean.  In the ocean,  substantial transport is due to bulk movement by currents such as  the Gulf Stream; another transport  mechanism is the mixing caused  by eddies that are shed from ocean currents due to hydrodynamic  instability.  A proper modeling of these phenomena requires high  spatial resolution and computations over long time intervals, and  climate-scale simulations of ocean circulation pose great  computational challenges that strain the capabilities of the most  powerful computers.  The aim of the present project is to improve  the efficiency and reliability of the algorithms that are used in  such computations.  A full-scale climate model would require both  a model of the atmosphere and a model of the ocean, and these  components must communicate in a way that simulates the  interaction of the real atmosphere and ocean.  The present  project focuses on an existing ocean model that is being prepared  at several sites for large-scale, coupled ocean-atmosphere  simulations.",
