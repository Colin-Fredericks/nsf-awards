 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jasin  9728333  Double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) induce recombination, especially between homologous chromosomes, which raises a number of questions relating to the mechanisms and products of recombination. This proposal addresses some of the key questions. A major objective is to understand the mechanism of DSB-induced gene conversion by examining events in mismatch repair deficient cells. The hypothesis is that the cellular mismatch repair system plays a role in DSB-induced recombination between diverged DNAs and influences the length of gene conversion tracts which have been observed. It will also be determined if DSBs overcome some of the barrier to recombination between diverged sequences. The second major objective is to determine if allelic recombination is associated with long conversion tracts and/or crossing-over, both of which may lead to large regions of chromosomal homozygosity. Induction of recombination between two different chromosomes will also be examined. In this study, the bipartite I-Sce I system will be utilized in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells which are diploid, rapidly proliferating cells and are of importance in creating germ-line mutations.    The repair of damaged DNA is important for the maintenance of genomic integrity in all organisms. Unrepaired or imprecisely repaired DNA can lead to mutagenesis, cell death or cell transformation. DNA damage resulting in single- and double-strand DNA breaks can occur from both exogenous insults, such as ionizing radiation and drug therapies and endogenous metabolic pathways, including DNA replication and recombination. The understanding that is gained about normal cellular DSB repair processes, in particular, repair by homologous recombination, is key to basic science studies and has relevance to health and medicine.",
