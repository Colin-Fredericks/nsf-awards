Environmental management problems are inherently  complex because the governing physical, chemical and  biological processes and their interactions are nonlinear  and difficult to represent in convenient mathematical  equations, further complicated by the multitude of other  important issues that must be considered, such as economics,  environmental impact and reliability. A major component of  this work is optimization for generation and identification  of efficient alternative solutions. Traditional optimization  procedures impose severe restrictions in using complex  nonlinear relationships common to environmental problem  solving. Genetic algorithms have been shown to be powerful  in addressing this issue and have the potential to make  significant improvement to the state-of-the-art. New  operators and procedures will be developed with the goal of  extending the use of GAs to present a limited set of  alternative solutions to complex problems, each of which  satisfy all quantified constraints, but which are otherwise  as far apart as possible in the decision space. In this way  a manageable number of alternatives can be evaluated that  constitute a wide assortment of choices on the less  quantified parameters. The academic plans include the  development of teaching modules and interactive techniques  for both students and practitioners; training aids will  permit students to learn to use  the tool and to compare its  results with those of other adaptive optimization  techniques. To ensure that the proposed systems  methodologies are applicable in practice, an array of  realistic applications associated with watershed management  has been identified and will be investigated in  collaboration with practitioners and other researchers. An  extensive case study of the Neuse River Basin in North  Carolina will be included.  ***",
