The objective of research on this  renewal award is to continue determination of the feasibility of  using microorganisms capable of using chlorate as an electron  acceptor in their metabolic processes for decontamination of soil  and aquifers.  The investigators plan on studying chlorate-based  microbial respiration in contrast with molecular oxygen pathways  by use of respiratory inhibitors to dissect the electron  transport chain.  Soil and aquifer contaminants to be  investigated in this research for determination of their  biodegradability by chlorate-respiring microorganisms include  toluene, p-xylene, ethylbenzene, naphthalene, carbon  tetrachloride, chlorophenol, chlorobenzoate, benzene, pentane and  phenol.  The contemplated decontamination process based on  results of the proposed research would involve simultaneous  injection of chlorates and chlorate-respiring organisms into the  contaminated soil or aquifer.    Results of this project are expected to provide the basis for its  potential application in engineering design of a system to  decontaminate  soil and groundwater aquifers by use of sodium  chlorate as a source of respiratory oxygen under conditions that  prevent or inhibit use of oxygen from atmospheric sources.  In  contrast to other potential chemical electron acceptors such as  nitrates and sulfates, byproducts of which are potential  groundwater pollutants, the only byproduct of biochemical  chlorate utilization is the chloride ion.  ***",
