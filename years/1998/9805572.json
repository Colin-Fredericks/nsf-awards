 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most living organisms show some form of rhythmic activity,  often with a daily cycle.  These cycles often are maintained even  in the absence of external cues such as changing light, and the  mechanisms of the relevant 'biological clocks' are not yet clear.  This meeting of the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms  will discuss a variety of the kinds of biological clocks found in  plant and animal organisms.  The emphasis of this NSF award is to  support attendance by graduate and undergraduate students as  trainees, to interact with leaders in the field with diverse  specializations.  The meeting includes a formal set of 'tutorials'  and symposia that provide integration of information for a broad  audience, as well as the regular sessions on special areas.     The meeting will have substantial impact on the participating  students, bringing them to the current leading edge of the field,  and promoting interaction with potential future mentors, and  impact on biological sciences in general by the integrated  perspective.",
