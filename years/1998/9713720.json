 "awd_abstract_narration": "Motivated by the belief that the next major advances in increased operational efficiency in semiconductor manufacturing will require operational methods that integrate product level market dynamics and process level models, the research will proceed along two thrusts:  the integration of product and market dynamics into operational decision making, and the incorporation of process level models into optimization algorithms at the operational level.  The first thrust will develop finite-horizon transient models that are directed towards total life cycle decision support. Such models will handle the complex dynamics of the product market, and support the technologies that enable efficient manufacturing for the right products at the right time.  The second thrust will develop models that integrate operational level models and process level models for the purpose of qualitatively and quantitatively assessing how process level improvements and changes benefit factory level production objectives. Such models will incorporate process response surface models into the operational modeling framework.   Just as the principles of concurrent engineering brought together design and manufacturing engineers, the research integrating operational methods with product dynamics and process models will serve to bring together engineers from the process level up through the product level to enhance factory level operational efficiency. Successful implementation of the research will lead to specific insights into the structure of optimal operational policies and into the sensitivity of operational decisions to underlying process parameters. These insights can then be used by operational and factory integration personnel to support discussions of suggested changes in policies at the product level and parameter settings at the process level.",
