 "awd_abstract_narration": "EDC's Center for Children and Technology, in collaboration  with commercial web developer MaMaMedia Inc., and Libraries  for the Future, has proposed an intensive three-year project  to develop Imagination Place! - an interactive on-line  design space that will invite girls ages 8-14 to think and  act as designers of technology, not just users.  Past  research has shown that by engaging girls in collaborative  design, new ways of \"seeing\" and thinking about technology's  role and importance in their lives become possible.  Imagination Place! will be crafted to involve girls as  shapers and makers of technologies and to promote  technological fluency.  The intent is to construct an on-  line design space that will provide powerful pathways for  girls into the world of engineering.    Imagination Place! will be a highly interactive Internet-  based environment where girls' ideas and visions for the  future of technology can be realized and grown.  Specifically, Imagination Place! will enable girls to (1)  engage in discovery-based activities that pique curiosity  and critical awareness about familiar technologies; (2)  create inventions that have personal meaning; (3) share  design ideas and concerns with peer mentors;  (4) interact  with real-world designers and engineers around short-term  design-based projects; and (5) offer resources and design-  related activities for parents and informal educators.    Building on a strong foundation of research around gender  and technology, EDC's Center for Children and Technology  brings to the project extensive knowledge about design-based  learning activities that are engaging for girls.  CCT's  prior work has led to the development of successful  strategies for supporting human collaboration and  interaction on-line among young women and engineers.  The  conceptual design of all activities and spaces within  Imagination Place! will build upon this work.  While  designed with girls' interests in mind, Imagination Place!  will also be relevant to diverse  populations of 8-14 year-  old children in home, school, and informal settings.",
