 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop scalable, automated  methods to design high-performance embedded systems - particularly  those with real-time latency and throughput requirements.  In such  systems, computations flow through heterogeneous interacting  components, which are managed by local resource-schedulers and  drivers.  Hence, a key design problem is that of balancing and  tuning the local resource-managers, so that they collaboratively  meet the global end-to-end performance objectives. The proposed  approach involves parametrically transforming the end-to-end  constraints into local (per-component) constraints, and then  solving them for optimal on-line performance.  Specifically, the  method works by (1) extracting performance models for key stages  along the all data paths; (2) hierarchically grouping the per-  component models into larger system-level prototypes; and (3)  using the system-level models to help calibrate the local resource  management policies. Step (3) is called \"design synthesis.\"  To  carry it out, the proposed method relies on off-line algorithms to  synthesize optimal CPU/IO bandwidth allocations for all pipeline  stages. After synthesis, the analytic estimates are checked via  simulation. Then the system is integrated, and rechecked via on-  line benchmarking. Two reference applications are proposed to  validate this framework: (1) A software realization of a large-  scale radar signal processor, to be run on several workstation-  clusters; and (2) a video server system connected via 100Mbs  partitioned Ethernet.",
