In this research, Davis and Hager focus on direct solution techniques, and the following avenues of research:  (1) numerical update and downdate methods, (2) ordering methods for reducing fill-in, including a powerful optimization approach, and (3) parallel unsymmetric factorization algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe problem of analyzing the effect of small changes in a system of equations arises in a wide range of applications, including optimization, finite-element problems, partial differential equations, and statistics, to name a few.  Sparse techniques will be developed to take into account both the sparsity pattern of the equations and the incremental nature of the system change.  Although long recognized as an important problem, the sparse case has not been fully developed.  In developing an algorithm that will be effective in a wide range of applications, some of the important features that will be addressed include multiple rank updates and downdates, matrix reordering and refactorization, the use of dense matrix kernels, and changes in matrix order.  When the coefficient matrix of a linear system has the special, but important, form of a matrix times its transpose, techniques for fill-reducing orderings will be developed that do not require the explicit formation of the matrix product.  This structure arises in QR factorization, in sparse partial pivoting methods, in interior point methods, in a dual active set approach for linear programming, and in outer-product sparse LU factorization methods.  In addition, a different pivoting strategy will be developed that uses optimization theory to solve a parameterized quadratic programming problem.  When the parameter is 1, this strategy yields the minimum degree scheme; setting the parameter to half the matrix dimension yields global nested dissection type strategies.  Hence, a continuum between local greedy and global strategies is obtained.  When the pivoting problem is recast in this way as an optimization problem, powerful optimization algorithms and analytical tools can be used to determine both optimal pivots (in a constrained sense) as well as approximate optima.  For large, sparse unsymmetric matrices, a parallel, distributed-memory, unsymmetric-pattern multifrontal factorization method will be developed.  The basic idea is to use graph partitioning techniques on the directed or bipartite graphs arising from the factorization of unsymmetric sparse matrices.  Factorization of the separated components of the graph will be guided by a coarse separator tree, and be based on dense matrix kernels.  Each node in the coarse separator tree will be factorized by a single processor.\r\n",
