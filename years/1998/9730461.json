 "awd_abstract_narration": "9730461  McFadden    As computational capacity has grown dramatically in recent decades, there has been a corresponding explosion in computational activity and research aimed at improving statistical inferences.  Because this activity is widespread and diverse, new computational methods often permeate slowly among applied researchers and into instructional courses.  The renewal for the Berkeley Symposium on Economics, Statistics, and Computation will provide a focal point for the dissemination of research, interaction between researchers in statistics and econometrics, demonstration of software, and instruction of graduate students.  The intensive use of computation in solving statistical and econometric problems promises to yield solutions to otherwise intractable problems.  In statistics, for example, bootstrap and related sampling techniques provide a general method for accurately approximating the sampling distribution of estimators and test statistics.  In econometrics, simulation methods are used to cover come the intractability of such complex models as high-dimensional  multinominal choice.  These are two of many examples.  Robust inference methods, graphical methods, Bayesian analyses, nonlinear time series models and semi- and non-parametric methods also draw heavily on new computational approaches.    This project continues a program of annual symposia begun in 1993 with a combination of instructional surveys and research presentations, and a mix of junior and senior scholars.  This grant supports symposia in each of the years 1998, 1999, and 2000.  Each symposium will be about five days in length, and will be held in facilities at the Econometrics Laboratory and the Department of Economics at the University of California at Berkeley.  The tentative topics are: Nonlinear & Non-Stationary Time Series Models; Statistical Software: Architecture, Languages, Algorithms; and Bayesian and Classical Econometrics: Computational Considerations.  A secondary, but substantial, administrative task  would be installation and testing of software provided by conference participants, and supervision of the documentation and release of this software through the Econometrics Laboratory Software Archives.            ??",
