 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725929  Torikachvili    This U.S.-Brazil award will support a research collaboration  between Drs. Milton Torikachvili and Alex Lacerda of San  Diego State University to work with Drs. Renato de  Figueiredo Jardim and Sergio Gama at the University of Sao  Paulo and the University of Campinas, respectively, on  electronic and magnetic properties of novel materials.    Specifically, they will study transport, magnetic, and  thermodynamic properties of strongly correlated electron  systems (SCES), and transition metal oxides displaying large  magnetoresistive effects.  The studies  will be done in low  magnetic fields, as well as in extreme conditions of high  magnetic fields and low temperatures on high quality  specimens, with the goal of advancing the understanding of  these materials and to test current models.    This collaboration will combine the resources, facilities  and expertise of San Diego State University, the National  High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Los Alamos, the University  of Sao Paulo and the University of Campinas.  The two  Brazilian universities support one of the largest efforts in  condensed matter research in Latin America.  At Los Alamos,  the PIs will be given access to the 60 tesla quasicontinuous  magnet, which is the world's strongest controlled power  magnet and the first one of its kind in the US.  The US PIs  bring their extensive experience in performing measurements  of electronic and magnetic properties at extreme conditions.  Professor Gama is experienced in the study of phase  relations in magnetic materials.  Dr. Jardim will be  training new students throughout this project.    ***",
