 "awd_abstract_narration": "Java is designed to be a mature, object-oriented programming  languagemainly for Web-based programming. However, Java can  support general stand-alone applications as well, such as  scientific codes that consist of independent components using  exceptions as a control mechanism between components. Although  Java is too new to have been used extensively in applications, it  is clear that user-defined exceptions will be ubiquitous in Java  programs, causing them to exhibit distinctive control flow,  different from previous object-oriented languages. The proposed  research concentrates on combining new analysis techniques with  two optimization strategies, namely speculative and non-  speculative, using a testbed of scientific applications for  validation. Exceptions pose new challenges to optimizing compilers  since they introduce implicit control flow and their semantics  requires access to user-visible state at any raised exception.  Optimization strategies may either preserve exceptions and their  visible states, or perform speculative optimizations by ignoring  exceptions, and restore the visible state if an exception is  raised. New static analyses are needed to provide an accurate  estimate of control flow within and across method boundaries,  including concrete type inference and subsequent def-use analyses.  The resulting information is crucial for the effectiveness of many  optimizations, including code specialization, code motion,  register allocation, and instruction scheduling.",
