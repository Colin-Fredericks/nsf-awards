 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Charles M.   Thompson, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Montana,   studies the synthesis and applications of alpha-aminophosphonothioic   acids (APTA's).  APTA's are a new class of molecules in which the   carboxylic acid group of an alpha-amino acid has been replaced by a   phosphonothioic acid moiety.  The APTA's are chiral at phosphorus and   additionally can display tautomerization between the P(O)SH and P(S)OH   forms.  Professor Thompson is developing new synthetic routes for the   preparation of  APTA's in both racemic and nonracemic form, relying on   the addition of thiophosphites to imines, aza-Claisen rearrangement, and   alkylation of 1,3-N,C-dianions derived from phosphonates.  In addition,   he exploits the tautomeric equilibrium to generate a site for disulfide   bond formation, offering the possibility of peptide intra-strand and   inter-chain linkage and the generation of novel beta-sheet structures in   synthetic peptides incorporating APTA's.  The ability of APTA's to serve   as asymmetric transition state analog inhibitors and to serve as central   elements in molecular systems designed to display marked conformational   changes upon metal ion complexation are also under exploration.    Replacement of the amino acids in biological proteins with `unnatural`   amino acids or functionally related derivatives offers the possibility of   modifying and controlling the structure and reactivity of proteins.  With   the support of the Organic Synthesis Program, Professor Charles M.   Thompson, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Montana,   carries out the synthesis and study of unusual amino acid analogs known   as alpha-aminophosphonothioic acids (APTA's), in which a P(O)SH group   replaces the C(O)OH group found in amino acids.  The incorporation of   APTA's in model protein structures allows the use of the pendant sulfur   atoms to effect the linking of protein chains, affording access to novel   protein architectures.  Professor Thompson also explores the possibility   that APTA-containing proteins may function as inhibitors for various   enzymes, and additionally uses APTA's as central elements in the design   of molecules designed to undergo extreme changes in molecular form upon   interaction with metal ions.",
