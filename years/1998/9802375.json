 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports -- under the ``Faculty in Industry''  activity of NSF's GOALI program -- the visit of Professor C.  Richard Johnson, Jr. (School of Electrical Engineering,  Cornell University) to Applied Signal Technology (Sunnyvale,  CA) for the 12-month period from August 1998 to July 1999.  As co-PI, Dr. Michael G. Larimore of Applied Signal  Technology monitors, expedites, and collaborates in all of  the major activities of the visit, including presentation of  a short course on adaptive equalizer theory and design,  development of a monograph on blind equalizer design (based    on over 12 years of experience at Applied Signal    Technology and 10 years of theoretical work at Cornell),    and participation in a product development team utilizing    adaptive digital signal processing in an emerging    communication system. The benefits of this bilateral    technology and pedagogy exchange include a heightening of    the relevance (and commensurate shrinkage of the theory-    practice gap) in Professor Johnson's future research and    teaching efforts and broad dispersion of course and    reference materials on adaptive equalization theory and    design tuned to the needs of the practicing communication    systems development engineer.",
