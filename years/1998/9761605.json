 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9761605  Martin    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project describes the development of a novel array-based chemical microsensor and a dedicated sampling system for the monitoring of chlorinated hydrocarbons in the subsurface.  Chlorinated hydrocarbons represent the most prevalent contaminants in the subsurface, threatening the quality of groundwater at aquifers.  Existing technology for monitoring these contaminants requires  expensive, labor-intensive methods of sample collection and analysis.  In the proposed sensor, the chemical and electrical properties of the individual elements of the array will be controlled so that a unique fingerprint will identify each pollutant.  The output signals will be integrated into a software-based neural network for analyte identification.  The simple design, cost, fabrication, and operation requirements of the proposed sensor will overcome the limitations of other existing array sensors.  The development of a low-cost, reliable sampling and monitoring system would reduce the cost associated with sampling and contaminant monitoring, and allow timely continuous information.  Also, it will provide the possibility for automated and unattended monitoring of the migration of contaminant plumes, as well as for monitoring contaminants that breach containment operations.  Phase I will (i) demonstrate the feasibility of the sensor design, (ii) develop a hand held prototype, and (iii) test contaminated groundwater.  During Phase II, a field deployable prototype instrument will be developed and demonstrated.    Potential Commercial Applications of the Research: The increasing emphasis on environmental issues, waste reduction, and improved efficiency for industrial processes has underlined the importance of the development of new chemical sensors for field or in-plant use.  Specifically, sensors are needed to gauge the effectiveness of remediation efforts, to effect waste minimization, and to detect the presence of toxic, hazardous, or otherwise regu lated chemicals in waste effluents, drinking water, and other environmental systems.  In addition, this proposed sensor will find wide application in the food, drink and perfume industries for the determination of odors and aromas, as well as in the clinical (e.g., breath monitor) and agronomic industries (e.g., detection of pesticides).  ***",
