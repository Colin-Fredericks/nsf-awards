 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732138  The Savannah River Ecology Laboratory's (SREL) goal for its  Research Experiences for Undergraduates program is to  provide research experience, training, and career  perspective for undergraduate students through the use of  SREL's unique field sites and laboratory facilities, and  through the association and active involvement in research  with full-time research ecologists.  Project participants  examine the influence of by-products from nuclear and fossil-  fuel energy production on selected biological and chemical  properties in southeastern ecosystems.  SREL faculty  members, all actively engaged in research and publication,  are paired with students having compatible research  interests.  Student projects, while distinct and  independent, are portions of ongoing research programs of  SREL.  The student experience is enhanced by interaction  with a programmatic team comprising individuals with a  diversity of ecological backgrounds, interest, and ideas.  Applicants from minority schools and regional institutions  with limited research programs are actively sought and  encouraged, as in previous years. Participant selection is  based upon the quality of an application, letters of  recommendation, and academic record.  Through the research  training of more than 500 undergraduate participants over  the past 29 years, SREL has created a highly successful  program of student/advisor interaction.  Scientific  publication and career development of former participants  attest to the success of the program.",
