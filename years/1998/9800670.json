 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  research  will develop a framework for the rapid  detection,  location,  and  identification of visual targets in  unconstrained  real  world domains.  This framework will lead to algorithms which  can be implemented on portable computers with video input with the  goal  of  being  used, for example, to enable  the  blind/visually  impaired  to  navigate in real world scenes.   These  requirements  mean that the algorithms must be extremely efficient at extracting  information  from  the  input  images.   The  approach  will   use  statistical  analysis of the targets and background,  taking  into  account  variations due to illumination and viewpoint  variations,  to determine probabilistic models for the appearance of the target  and  background.  From these models, sets of tests and  groups  of  tests  will  be  determined.  These tests will be designed  to  be  maximally  informative, based on statistical  measures  of  errors  rates   such  as  Chernoff  Information,  and  to  lead  to   fast  implementations on portable PC's.  The search strategy is based on  the intuition of picking tests which maximize the expected gain in  information  about the target hypothesis.  In practical  problems,  however,  it will not always be possible to compute these expected  information  gains  in real time.  Therefore the  search  strategy  will  make  use  of  a  more general formulation  in  terms  of  A  algorithms where the search is guided by a heuristics taylored  to  the  application  domain.  Expected information  is  one  possible  heuristic  but  there  are  many  others  which  are  more  easily  computable  and which can still give provable convergence  to  the  optimal solution.",
