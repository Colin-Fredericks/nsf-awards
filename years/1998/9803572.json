 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technological advances in new electronic and bio-medical systems \r\nincreasingly rely on the development of new materials with \r\nbi-stable  or multi-stable response at the microlevel that can actively \r\nrespond to environmental changes and provide functions of sensing, \r\nprocessing, actuation and feedback. Actual design guidelines can be \r\nobtained from the analysis of lattice models because the \r\nmicrostructures, which largely control macroscopic behavior of the \r\nmaterials with bi-stable elements, often depend on  the parameters of the \r\ncrystalline structure. The results of this project will contribute to a \r\ndeeper understanding of the relation between discrete systems with \r\nbi-stable elements and continuum systems with nonconvex energies, an issue \r\nwhich is crucial for the development of efficient numerical methods and \r\ncontrol codes for active devices.\r\n\r\nThe micromachinery that is being designed in laboratories today and will become\r\nubiquitous tomorrow operates on sub-micron scales.  Traditional approaches \r\nfor the design of such devices often yield unsatisfactory results. \r\nThe complexity of the behavior at this scale can only be achieved  if a \r\nmulti-stable \"mechanism\" is integrated into the material at the molecular level.  \r\nThe simplest example is a bi-stable mechanism, where a device consists of many tiny \r\nelements that can be in two stable states, say bent or straight.  The transition from\r\none state to the other is provided by a phase transition which can be controlled by \r\nmechanical stress, temperature, electric or magnetic fields.  The bi-stability leads \r\nto characteristic microstructures represented by a large number of defects, that is \r\nboundaries between the two possible states within the device.  The large strains \r\nobserved in such active materials are produced by the coordinated migration of \r\nthese mobile defects in the process of domain \"switching\".  The main goal \r\nof this research is to study these nonlinear processes and to obtain a more complete \r\nunderstanding and control of the properties of active materials from the \r\nperspective of a micromodel.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n",
