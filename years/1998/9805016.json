 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wavelength routed wide area networks will be an integral part of the future of  all-optical network infrastructures.  It is envisioned that these networks will act as the backbone that provides the interconnection for local area lightwave sub-networks attached to them.  A significant amount of research effort has been devoted to the design and evaluation of wavelength routed architectures in recent years.  However, the deployment of an infrastructure that will enable large scale interconnection of optical networks raises a number of fundamental and challenging problems that require novel and innovative solutions.  The research plan outlined in this proposal identifies a number of significant but open problems arising in wavelength routed environments, and presents a comprehensive and novel approach to address them.  The outcome of the proposed research will be an analytical framework that will permit the researchers  to efficiently compute call blocking probabilities in wavelength routed networks, evaluate wavelength assignment policies and converter placement strategies, investigate routing algorithms for arbitrary network topologies, and study the performance of multicast calls.  One of the main objectives of the  work is to identify potential fairness problems that may arise in such an environment, and to employ a combination of routing , converter placement, and wavelength assignment strategies to alleviate these problems and ensure fair treatment for all calls.",
