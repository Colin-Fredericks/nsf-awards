 "awd_abstract_narration": "Shoichet  9734484  CAREER: Identifying Binding Sites on Proteins    1. Technical     tip1 The fundamental goal of this study is to understand how protein structure determines function through identification of ligand binding sites on protein surfaces, using beta-lactamase AmpC as a model system. The experiments are designed to characterize mutant enzymes with substitutions made in known binding sites, measuring the changes in their thermodynamic stability.  Residues positioned to interact with substrates or inhibitors are also examined for the stability effect.  The aim is to test a \"stability-function\" hypothesis which may provide the basis of a new tool to dissect and predict the structures of proteins.  The didactic program is built around this research as it integrates into the requirements of graduate and professional education.  Through the design of a new biochemistry and a new pharmacology course, graduate students will be introduced to current questions in protein structure-function, and trained in the biophysical and biochemical techniques necessary to investigate these questions.      2. Non-technical     A key question in Biology is how the structures of proteins determine their functions. A simple constraint on the structure and organization of protein binding sites may suggest just such a general method for predicting what sorts of ligands they will recognize.  Proteins use highly functionalized clefts to bind ligands and catalyze reactions.  These clefts do not appear to be optimized for protein stability.  This study is designed to remove known binding sites by residue substitution, testing significant stabilization of a protein by certain surface alterations.  The establishment of such relationships would have broad applicability to structure-function studies, offering a new tool to dissect the structures of proteins and predict what they will and will not work upon. The didactic program is built around this research as it integrates biophysical and biochemical techniques and pr inciples into the requirements of graduate and professional education.       tip1 Yes, this is really the Project Summary Form.
