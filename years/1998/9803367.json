 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on developing calixarene synthetic methodology, and examining functionalized calixarenes as enzyme mimics and fullerene hosts.   The scope and limitations of the acid-catalyzed preparation of calixarenes will be explored, as well as different methodologies developed to introduce functionalities onto the molecular framework.  Functionalized calixarenes will be synthesized as examined as fullerene hosts and enzyme mimics.   Undergraduates and postdoctoral students involved in the research will be trained in organic synthesis and its applications to calixarene synthesis.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research and educational activities of Dr. David Gutsche of the Department of Chemistry at Texas Christian University.  Dr. Gutsche will focus his research efforts on developing new synthetic routes to vase-shaped molecules, referred to as calixarenes, and the methodology needed to functionalize these molecular frameworks.   Modified calixarenes will be examined as \"molecular baskets\" in which other molecules can be placed and their reactivity tuned.   Dr. Gutsche's educational activities involve training undergraduate and postdoctoral students in organic synthesis, and its application to the preparation and modification of this class of molecules.    \r\n",
