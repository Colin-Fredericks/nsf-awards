 "awd_abstract_narration": "Singularly perturbed partial differential equations are \r\nused to model boundary and interior layers in transport \r\nand fluid flow, and in high frequency wave propagation. \r\nIt is difficult to approximate the solution to these equations \r\nbecause of regions of rapid change in the solution. \r\nThe best approximation properties of solutions to \r\nsome singularly perturbed linear partial differential \r\nequations will be studied. The research will build on \r\nsome recent work of Kellogg and Stynes that treats a\r\nsingularly perturbed self adjoint problem. Equations that \r\nmodel convection and wave propagation will be studied. \r\nThe goal is to obtain the best approximation properties \r\n(in the sense of Kolmogorov) when the data of the problem \r\nare restricted to have a specified smoothness. A \r\nsuccessful resolution of these best approximation \r\nproblems will lead to asymptotic expansions of the \r\nsolution with minimal smoothness requirements on the \r\ndata, and hopefully to better numerical methods for the \r\nnumerical computation of these solutions.\r\n\r\nPhysical systems that involve boundary and interior \r\nlayers are of considerable importance in industrial \r\napplications.  A typical example is the turbulent layer of \r\nair near an aircraft wing.  Wave propagation problems, \r\narising e.g. in radar or ultrasound are important in \r\nboth medical and military applications. These seemingly \r\ndifferent problems are similar in that there are \r\nphenomena taking place over a very short span of distance or \r\ntime. This leads to difficulties in calculating the behavior \r\nof such systems. The research under this award will study the basic \r\napproximation properties of the equations governing these \r\nsystems.\r\n",
