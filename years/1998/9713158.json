 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713158  Gregory  The database of bridge assessment is essential in  determining which structures are most critical for limited  monies.  However, an evaluation which would assess the  various costs associated with the various repair procedures  is unavailable.  Such an evaluation is highly needed to  assist in the immense task of selecting economically smart  repair/strengthen options available for these structurally  deficient bridges.  This research will assist in the  development of such an evaluation.  The life cycle cost  assessment technology for cost benefit evaluation of bridge  infrastructure rehabilitation/strengthening or renewal is  based on technical acquisition and assessment of bridge  design and repair options.    This research is a joint, integrated effort between Georgia  Tech and University of Arizona.  For the construction  industry, the life cycle cost benefit evaluation will  provide a thorough and consistent assessment technology for  handling the complex decisions and estimating in  infrastructure renewal.  The life cycle cost benefit  evaluation will allow construction and policy makers to  potentially save millions of taxpayers' and industrial  capital dollars.    The impact of the life cycle cost benefit evaluation will  provide, for the first time, an assessment technology to  evaluate various repair alternatives and emerging  technologies on infrastructure renewal and the bridge  construction industry.  To the academic and scientific  community, the life cycle research will push the bounds of  knowledge-based systems.  ***",
