 "awd_abstract_narration": "CTS-9733876  Wassgren, Carl  Clemson University  Abstract    The objective is to investigate mixing and segregation of deep beds of single- and multi-component particulate mixtures in response to vertical and horizontal vibrations with sinusoidal and random oscillation profiles.  The work will consist of experiments utilizing high speed video and digital image processing for determining particle velocity fields and mixing concentrations, three dimensional discrete element computer simulations for investigating the effects of various parameters and environments, and analytical methods based on geometric arguments and kinetic theory for modeling the material response.      The proposed educational program will include the development of a course concerning particle science and technology.  Involvement of local industries and other universities will be a key aspect of the course.  Additionally, local companies concerned with particulate engineering issues will be encouraged to participate in the existing senior level \"capstone\" design course.  Java-based computer visualization tools for presenting fundamental engineering concepts will also be developed as part of the educational program.  These tools will result in more efficient class room instruction and better student comprehension of critical concepts.  World Wide Web pages will also be developed to supplement in-class topics.    If successful, the results of the proposed research will provide a better understanding and education of the fundamental mechanisms involved in mixing and segregation processes and may lead to improved designs for transporting, blending, and separating materials in industries handling particulates.  ***",
