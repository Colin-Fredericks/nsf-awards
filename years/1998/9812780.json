 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action is to support a preliminary assessment and planning for the seismic instrumentation of the Loma Los Colorados waste disposal facility in the outskirts of Santiago, Chile.  \r\n\r\nThe Loma Los Colorados solid waste facility is now under construction.  The region is exposed to frequent  earthquakes, and some great earthquakes have shaken the region in historic and modern times.  For example, in October 1997, the region was shaken by a magnitude 7 earthquake.  At the present no comprehensive strong motion acceleration data form landfills exist.  Yet, observations are crucial in order to validate results from existing numerical models.  Until adequate data sets are obtained, predictions form these models of existing and proposed landfills will remain questionable.  Therefore, the central and southern region of Chile is an ideal location in which to instrument engineered structures in anticipation of strong  accelerations from earthquakes.\r\n\r\nKDM, Inc. The behavior of solid waste landfills during earthquakes is a subject of concern to the designers and builders as well as to those who live near them.  The builder of the Loma Los Coloados waste fill, has agreed to handle the installation, monitoring, and support of the instrumentation, and to report any records promptly to the international scientific community.  This is an ideal opportunity  to obtain  strong motion data form an instrumented landfill shaken by a major earthquake.\r\n\r\n",
