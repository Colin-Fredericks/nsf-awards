 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crowley  9812786       The investigator and his colleagues organize a workshop on  uncertainty in modeling and simulation.  Its aim is to sketch out  broad scientific questions and promising avenues of research  related to uncertainty issues, to document the potential impact  of the issues, and to produce a report outlining key research  issues.  The report will be distributed in print and via the web.       Uncertainty issues arise throughout science and engineering.  The problems these fields tackle involve nonlinear phenomena and  complex systems that are not well understood; observations are  not error-free and are irregular in space and time (weather and  climate data typify these characteristics); and many natural and  engineering processes are inherently stochastic or chaotic.  The  mathematical and statistical models of such systems share the  same features of complexity, nonlinearity, and stochasticity.  Scientists, mathematicians, and engineers analyze and compute  with these models to understand and predict the underlying  systems.  Therefore the recognition and the management of  uncertainty are important issues in both analysis and computation  as well.  Hence the meeting involves engineers, mathematicians,  and scientists.  The interplay between these disciplines is  essential to form the required perspective of opportunities and  challenges that arise from dealing with uncertainty.  Identifying  key research issues is an important step in guiding research; the  results affect every area of science and engineering.",
