 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Career Research Project is to develop  innovative semi-active structural sysems for earthquake  protection, in which stiffness and damping can be varied  independently, using a newly developed novel semi-active  independently  varible stiffness and damping device  (SAIVSD).  The existing semo-active variable sstiffness and damping  devices for response control is limited because the  stiffness and damping are either closely coupled or  variation of only damping or only stiffness is possible.  Research will be carried out to (1) study SAIVSD device  experimentally and analytically; (2) develop control  algorithms; (3) implement the device with real time control  systems in scaled building models representing fixed base  and base isolated buildings and bridges; and (4) evaluate  the performance of the new system by shake tabletesting and  numerical simulations.  The comprehensive nature of this  study will permit the evaluation of the capabilities of  device and the advantages and disadvantages of using such  devices in structural systems.  Semi-active control systems have significant potential for  practical implementation for earthquake protection in the  near future.  The research would contribute to the  development of new and innovative semi-active control  systems .  The research will bee performed in clos  collaboration with the industry which will accelerate the  implementation of semi-active control system and hybrid  isolation systems.  The integral compnents educational compnents include (1)  furher development of innovative teaching software BEST an  usage in dynamics corse; (2) introduction of new advanced  software into undergraduate and graduate course to enhance  learning experience of students; (3) promote hands-on  experimets in dynamics for effective learning; (4)  development of a new earthquake engineering and structural  control course ; (5) introductio if interesting concepts in  dynamics to undergraduate and school students; and (6)  coordinated out re arch activities including presentations at  area schools and laboratory tours.  The educational program  is aimed at enhancing the learning experience of graduate,  undergraduate, and school students.",
