This CAREER award will support research focused on  the synthesis and characterization of new mixed-valent materials  with layered perovskite-type structures.  Specifically, new mixed-  valent titanates and niobates will be targeted via direct  preparation in molten chloride fluxes.  Characterization of the  electronic and magnetic properties of these materials will  elucidate structure--property relationships in a series of  compounds with similar structures and varying compositions.  The  results of this research will expand the repertoire of synthetic  strategies to early transition metal oxides and provide valuable  insight into what structural and electronic features are  necessary for superconductivity in reduced titanates and  niobates.  The educational plan will emphasize mentoring  undergraduate students in research and integrating the theme of  structure-property relationships in layered perovskites into the  Introductory Inorganic Chemistry course through the development  of several new laboratory projects.  In addition, a student-based  outreach program to local high school chemistry classrooms will  be initiated, and illustrative examples of structure-property  relationships in extended solids will be disseminated to the  larger educational community through the development of a World  Wide Web site.  %%%  In an inherently interdisciplinary field like materials  research, the role of the solid state chemist is to lead the  drive to discover new materials with interesting properties.  New materials will, in turn, stimulate physicists, materials  scientists, and engineers to think about ways to harness these  properties for technological applications.  The discovery of  new materials lies at the heart of this research plan and  remains central to future progress in ma terials research.  On a  broader level, the primary impact of this work will be the rich  educational experience of undergraduates participating in  cutting-edge research.  Through this project, students at Reed  College will experience how modern science is done and the role  of chemists in shaping the solid state materials of the future.  ***",
