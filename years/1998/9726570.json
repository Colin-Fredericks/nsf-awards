 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Robert E. Wyatt at the Department of Chemistry, University of   Texas at Austin, is supported by a grant from the Theoretical and   Computational Chemistry Program at NSF for theoretical studies of the   spectra, dynamics, and reactions of small polyatomic molecules. The work   supported under this grant is specifically concerned with spectroscopy   and time-dependent vibrational dynamics.  It is divided into four topics:   (1) quantum dynamics and spectroscopy of benzene; (2) multiple timescale   intramolecular dynamics of formyl fluoride; (3) state specificity and   dissociation dynamics fluoroform; and (4) extraction of interior   eigenstates from large matrices.  The common theme which links the various parts of the work being carried   out under this grant is to obtain information about and understanding of   the time, spatial, and energetic aspects of the evolution of   vibrationally excited states.  The dynamical properties and the spectra   of molecules are consequences of   the way in which the electrons and the   nuclei which compose the molecule   interact with each other. A goal of   the supported research is to learn how information about these   fundamental interactions can be extracted from a knowledge of the   molecular dynamics and spectra.",
