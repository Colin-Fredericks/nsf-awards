 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to improve the teaching of marine science to undergraduate students by acquiring the infrastructure necessary to integrate Marine Information Processing (MIP) equipment into the undergraduate Marine Science Program curriculum at the University of South Carolina. MIP is Geographic Information Processing (GIP) applied to marine problems, a combination of remote sensing, digital image processing, global positioning systems, geographic information systems, geostatistics, modeling, and telecommunications. In modern marine research, scientists utilize MIP for a variety of applications in the physical geological, chemical, and biological disciplines. Excellent basic GIP courses already exist in the Department of Geography at the University of South Carolina, and the Department of Geography will continue to teach all basic GIP/MIP courses. Marine Science majors interested in MIP will be encouraged to complete a newly instituted minor in Geographical Information Processing in the Department of Geography in preparation for upper level marine science course laboratory and exercises redesigned to take full advantage of the new MIP technology. A series of Geography courses will serve as prerequisites to select upper level Marine Science courses with MIP content, making sure that the GIP/MIP technology is integrated well into Marine Science lectures laboratory exercises, and undergraduate experiences. This will help Marine Science graduates from the University of South Carolina to become better prepared to enter the job market and participate in solving complex environmental and societal problems. With the full support of the Department of Geography, we propose to provide marine students hands-on experience utilizing MIP tools in lecture and lab settings by purchasing a turn-key High Resolution Picture Transmission (HRPT) acquisition and processing station, computer software and hardware necessary for processing marine data, and field-capable instruments, including laptop computers, radiometers a nd hand-held global positioning system (GPS) units. Although he basic GIP/MIP preparation will e offered by the Department of Geography, we will continue to develop innovative MIP laboratory exercises and applications within the Marine Science curriculum and publish these as exercise and laboratory manuals. The impact of integration of MIP technology in the marine science curriculum will be assessed via an exit exam and student course evaluations. Funding of this proposal will also help undergraduate students to gain valuable marine research experience by use of modern technology.",
