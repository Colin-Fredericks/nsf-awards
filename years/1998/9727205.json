 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Experimental Physical Chemistry Program supports Prof. George W.   Flynn of Columbia University in his continuing studies on collision   dynamics and relaxation of molecules with `chemically significant`   amounts of vibrational energy.  Prof. Flynn will prepare high energy or   reactive donor molecules using excimer-pumped dye lasers or optical   parametric oscillators and then monitor the final quantum state of the   collision or reaction products using IR/VIS absorption or UV   fluorescence.  Doppler-resolved IR diode laser spectroscopy will yield   information on the velocity of product molecules.  Thus Prof. Flynn can   determine the vibrational, rotational and translational energy of the   energy acceptor (bath) molecules.  The ultimate goal is to determine the   energy transfer distribution function P(E,E'), i.e., the probability that   a molecule, initially at an energy E, will undergo a collision induced   transition to an energy E', with change in vibrational energy of E'-E.    The PI will investigate the mechanism for excitation of quencher   vibrational 'dark' states and will measure the distribution function at   low temperatures (10K) to gauge the effects of collision velocity and   complex formation in the relaxation process.    The importance of the research is that it sheds light on the mechanism by   which molecules dissociate, or break apart, and recombine.  Normally, we   assume that the loss of gain of vibrational energy is controlled by very   strong collisions between molecules, but this is a gross approximation   compared to the detail with which other processes, for example, the   dissociation rate as a function of energy, are known.  The distribution   function that Prof. Flynn will obtain, when coupled with good theoretical   calculations, should allow a much deeper understanding of the   dissociation and recombination processes that are so important to   combustion and atmospheric chemistry.",
