 "awd_abstract_narration": "This starter grant award of the Chemistry Division to San Diego State   University supports the research of Professor David Burkey.  The theme of   the research is the use of electrophilic activation in manipulating the   reactivity of transition-metal complexes.  A bimetallic complex will be   generated by binding a second metal species to a ligand of the original   complex.  The incoming metal species will withdraw electron density from   an aromatic substituent at the site of attachment in the complex, thereby   modifying the nature and reactivity of the original metal complex.  New   types of bimetallic complexes with imido, carbyne, acetylene, and   isocyanide groups as the bridging ligands in these studies function as   excellent electronic bridges, maximizing cooperative interactions between   the two metals.  The reactivity of the bimetallic complexes will be   examined with emphasis on identifying and exploiting new types of   reactivity unavailable to the individual metal complexes.  Formation of bimetallic complexes such as studied in this project may be   an effective means of producing catalysts as well as in developing new   organometallic materials which exhibit desirable optical and magnetic   properties.  Such compounds can serve as models for new types of   metal-containing polymers with other desirable material properties.",
