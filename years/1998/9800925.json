 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research(SBIR) Phase II project involves use of ion implantation for modifying the surface properties of metal alloys to mitigate the growth of catalytic coke that forms on furnace tubes during the thermal cracking of hydrocarbons for the production of olefins. Because coke deposits diminish heat transfer rates, thermal efficiencies and product yields, the control of coke growth rate in furnace tubes can significantly enhance the profitability of olefins production. A substantial reduction in the the rate of coke formation on metal coupons by ion implantation of selected elements was  demonstrated in Phase I. Ion implantation produces a coke-inhibiting surface layer that is less prone to degradation under the harsh conditions of a thermal cracker compared to pure coatings formed using alternate treatment methods. In Phase II, test specimens will be prepared using a conformal treatment method known as plasma ion immersion implantation and deposition (PIIID), and the effect of implant composition on coke inhibition will be measured using a lab-        scale thermal cracking reactor. The method will be used to treat an industrial furnace tube section that will be tested in a pilot-scale coking reactor.  The technology developed in this program will lead to treated furnace tubes with substantially increased on-line time, efficiency and product yield for thermal crackers used to produce olefins such as ethylene, propylene and butylene. Coke formation is estimated to cost a modern ethylene facility about $10,000,000 per year.",
