 "awd_abstract_narration": "9807100  Brown, Wes    Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of animals is a small, extrachromosomal genome  typically about 16 kilobases and containing 37 genes.  MtDNA comparisons  among major animal groups suggest several generalities: 1) With the  exception of some cnidarian mtDNAs, and otherwise for a single  protein-encoding gene (ATP8), gene content is invariant, consisting of 37  genes. 2) Gene arrangements commonly remain unchanged over long periods of  evolutionary time. 3) There is little selection for particular gene  arrangements. 4) The great number of potential gene rearrangements makes  convergence in different lineages unlikely. 5) With few exceptions, gene  arrangements seem stable within major groups, but variable between them.  All of these characteristics make the comparison of mitochondrial gene  arrangements a powerful means for inferring ancient phylogenetic  relationships. From these comparisons we have been able to infer several  higher level evolutionary relationships for which all other types of data  had been equivocal. We intend to determine the complete mitochondrial DNA  sequences and gene arrangements of an animal representing each of the  following groups: The crustacean groups Remipedia and Maxillopoda,  Myriapoda, Pentastoma, Priapula, Phoronida, Ectoprocta, the brachiopod  groups Articulata and Inarticulata, the mollusk groups Cephalopoda and  Scaphopoda, the annelid groups Polychaeta and Hirudinea, Pogonophora,  Sipuncula, Echiura, Nematoda, and Platyhelminthes. We will compare these  cladistically, along with many published gene arrangements, as well as  compare DNA and inferred amino acid sequences in order to infer  evolutionary relationships among higher metazoan groups.",
