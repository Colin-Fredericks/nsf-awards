 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726657  Yanch  This proposal is on research to develop accelerator-based,  fast neutron brachytherapy for the treatment of tumors.  Radiotherapy using neutrons has been shown to be effective  in treating a number of tumor types including advanced  tumors of the brain.  However, the use of external beams of  neutrons has also led to unacceptable healthy tissue  complications.  In this research, damage to healthy tissue  would be avoided by using a very small bachytherapy tube,  which delivers neutrons from a small accelerator coupled to  a flexible positioning device.  Using a small accelerator,  instead of an external beam of neutrons, has important  advantages since it: (1) eliminates storage and handling  problems since this neutron source can be turned off when  not in use, (2) maintains a constant intensity when in use,  and (3) can produce a neutron energy spectrum that can be  somewhat tailed for tumor size, and (4) can deliver therapy  in a much shorter period of time than that of other methods  under consideration.  Preliminary studies by the  investigator have indicated the feasibility of this  technique, but also indicated a heating problem, which  requires active cooling during use.  The current research  would then investigate the physical and engineering  feasibility of this therapy approach.  The major elements of  this proposed research include: (1) design and testing of a  new prototype tube to enhance heat removal, including full  evaluation of cooling failure conditions, (2) neutron and  photon dosimetry in a tissue equivalent phantom over a range  of particle currents and particle energies, including the  duel ion chamber method for mixed field dosimetry at large  distances from the source and radiochromic film dosimetry  close to the source, and (3) design of a gantry system and  moveable treatment couch to produce a practical and reliable  positioning system which provides complete freedom for  locating the brachytherapy tube at any orientation.  ***",
