 "awd_abstract_narration": "Russell Brown will pursue research in two areas: inverse problems for   partial differential equations and regularity for boundary value   problems in nonsmooth domains.    Many of the fundamental laws of nature are expressed as partial   differential equations. In an inverse problem, one attempts to recover   a coefficient in a partial differential equation from information   about solutions of the equation. This provides a mathematical model   for determining physical properties of an object (such as its   conductivity) from measurements (such as voltage and current at the   boundary). In the problem I will study, the inverse conductivity   problem, we consider exactly the example described above: determine a   spatially inhomogeneous conductivity from measurements of current and   voltage made at the boundary. The innovation in my research is to   attempt to determine the least restrictive hypotheses under which this   determination can be made.     The second area of investigation is related to boundary value problems   for various partial differential equations in nonsmooth domains. In   contrast to the inverse problem considered above, here we are   considering the more straightforward problem of obtaining solutions to   a partial differential equation given information at the  boundary. This is a mathematical model for the problem of (for   example) of finding the voltage potential in the interior from   knowledge of the potential at the boundary. The innovation in my   research is to establish minimal (and more realistic) hypotheses under   which the solution can be shown to exist.",
