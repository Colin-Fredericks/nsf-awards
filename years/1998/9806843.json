RE is challenged to provide a framework for multi-disciplinary stakeholders to collaborate, understand, and negotiate on change, as well as to serve as a framework for the changes to be realized in the real world via the design and implementation tasks.  The WinWin research project investigates models and their automated support tools that address the above challenges.  In particular, the research investigates (a) Models of the RE tasks and processes by capitalizing on the opportunity to use an existing tool, called WinWin, as an instrument to collect data on RE activity in real-client projects involving various sites, domains, clients, and project teams, and (b) Automated support for the RE tasks by capitalizing on the opportunity to build on the WinWin tool as an experimental distributed RE support tool that mediates multi-stakeholders concerns and the RE context of such concerns.  The expected results will provide a significant new level of visibility into the tasks and processes of RE as a framework for collaborating and negotiating on change and the types of in-process models and products and their role in change management and negotiation.\r\n",
