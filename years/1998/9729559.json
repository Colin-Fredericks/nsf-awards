 "awd_abstract_narration": "This researach is concerned with the development of 'collective' models of household behavior, where household is represented as a group of several individuals, each of whom is characterized by a specific utility function, and who make Pareto efficient agreements.  Such representations aim at understanding, in particular, how the members respective 'power' or bargaining positions affect intrahousehold allocation of consumption and welfare, as well as household behavior as a whole.  This has important implications for the design of optimal policies; for instance, should benefits be given to specific members, under a specific form (say, education to women), and others.  A first goal is to deepen the theoretical foundations of these models, and to solve some of the questions that are still open.  A second part of the research will be devoted to empirical applications, especially in the case of labor supply.  Finally, the model will be extended to include uncertainty and dynamics.",
