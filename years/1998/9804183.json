This  fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain  additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue innovative and imaginative research into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular, cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation.    Each fellowship supports a research and training plan to be  carried out in a sponsoring laboratory.  The research and  training plan for this fellowship is entitled  characterization of multiple mechanisms for glucocorticoid  action in the stress response pathway in a sparrow.  Survival and reproduction in the wild depend upon an  animal's ability to perceive events in the environment and  to adjust physiology and behavior appropriately.  Unpredictable events rapidly increase levels of circulating  glucocorticoids, eliciting physiological and behavioral  responses and serving to avoid chronic stress.  There is  evidence for three glucocorticoid receptors in the avian  brain: two intracellular and one membrane.  These receptors  should have distinctly different temporal responses to  glucocorticoids and therefore different roles in the  regulation of the stress response.  This series of  experiments characterizes and localizes these receptors in  the avian brain and elucidates the pathway from a perceived  stressor to behavioral changes in a free-living, seasonal  vertebrate, Gambel's white-crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia  leucophrys gambelii).",
