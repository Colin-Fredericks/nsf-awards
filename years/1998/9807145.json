Essentially all aphids harbor intracellular prokaryotic symbionts (assigned to the genus Buchnera) within specialized cells. The endosymbionts cannot be grown outside the aphid. Aphids are dependent on Buchnera; elimination of the endosymbionts results in death of the aphid. Plant-sap, the diet of aphids, is rich in carbohydrates but deficient in amino acids. Insects require ten preformed amino acids and it is thought that one of the functions of the endosymbiont is the synthesis of these amino acids for the aphid. The investigator's past studies, as well as those of other investigators, have provided evidence that the endosymbionts make the essential amino acid tryptophan for the host. From previous studies there is nutritional evidence that the endosymbiont also synthesizes the essential branched chain amino acids (isoleucine, valine, leucine). The pathway of branched chain amino acid biosynthesis involves several enzymes common to both isoleucine and valine biosynthesis. The leucine pathway originates from intermediates of the valine pathway. Other investigators have found that in the Buchnera of some aphids, the genes for leucine biosynthesis are located on a plasmid. The goal of this research is to provide evidence on whether Buchnera is involved in the biosynthesis of branched chain amino acids. In this project the investigator will use the aphids Schizaphis graminurn and Diuraphis noxia, both of which are pests of cereals. The comparisons of Buchnera from these two aphids is of interest since previous studies suggested that there is less demand for the biosynthetic activities of Buchnera in the aphid Diuraphis noxia. Since Buchnera cannot be cultivated outside the aphid, the investigator will use several approaches to examine whether Buchnera synthesizes branched-chain amino acids for the aphid host. Initially the laboratory will establish if the genes encoding enzymes of the branched chain amino acid biosynthetic pathway are present in Buchnera from the aphids S. graminum and D. noxia. This will involve cloning and sequencing endosymbiont DNA fragments which hybridize with probes for these genes. Subsequently,  the endosymbionts will be purified and assayed for the presence of activities of selected enzymes of the branched chain biosynthetic pathway. Using the quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, the investigator's laboratory will also determine the levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding these selected enzymes.  Increases in the activity and mRNA levels of key regulated enzymes are expected.  In addition, the specific activities and  the levels of mRNA for the enzymes from Buchnera from S. graminurn may be higher than those for the enzymes from Buchnera from D. noxia. One possible adaptation to an endosymbiotic association and overproduction of amino acids is desensitization of key regulated enzymes to end-product feedback inhibition.  The genes for such key Buchnera enzymes will be overexpressed in Escherichia coli  and  enzymes purified; their kinetic properties, with respect to substrates and end-product inhibitors, will be determined.\r\nSince Buchnera is essential for the survival of aphids, information on the endosymbiont's function,  genetics, and physiology may provide a means of controlling aphid populations. Research on the biosynthesis of branched chain amino acids by aphid endosymbionts may reveal ways in which it will be possible to interfere with the biosynthesis of these essential amino acids, thereby reducing aphid populations on agriculturally important plants. This could have a major economic impact since the debilitation of plants by aphids and by the plant viruses the aphids transmit significantly reduces agricultural productivity.\r\n \r\n  \r\n",
