 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non Technical Abstract      Song dialects, mating success and gene flow in mountain  white-crowned sparrows      Bird song is culturally transmitted; that is, young  songbirds learn species-typical song by copying adults.  Thus, geographic variations or song dialects (analogous to  human accents) often arise.  Several hypotheses  have been advanced to explain the evolutionary significance  of song dialects.  The predictions generated by these  hypotheses differ in the proposed role of song dialect in  male mating success and in the degree to  which dialect groups are genetically distinct.  The effects  of song dialects on male reproductive success, and the role  of dialects as barriers to mating, will be investigated in  mountain white-crowned sparrows  Zonotrichia leucophrys oriantha.  Molecular genetic  techniques will be used to measure how song dialects  produced by individual males affect their reproductive  success (the number of offspring males sire in their own  nests and in the population at large) and to assess  interbreeding within and among different dialect  populations.    This research will specifically increase our knowledge of  how song dialects affect mate choice and population  structure in songbird species.  More generally, an exciting  link between cultural and biological evolution may be  demonstrated.  The effect of habitat fragmentation on  dialect persistence and population structure will also be  addressed, with possible implications for conservation  biology.",
