 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9800323  Feeny   Material removal during milling may be steady or oscillatory, depending on materials, geometry, and parameters such as depth of cut and cutting speed. The dynamics of material removal affects the quality of the finished surface. This is reflected in the form of chips which may be smooth or segmented.  The objective of this GOALI project is to derive models that describe these behaviors and their dependencies on parameters, and verify the models with experiments. Basic assumptions in an existing two-dimensional model for material removal, which accounts for the onset of chip segmentation, will be relaxed to allow the modeling of more phenomena and parameter dependencies which are observed experimentally. To verify the upgraded model, experiments are to be conducted with orthogonal and conventional cutting geometry on a high-speed milling machine at the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory at NIST. Cutting will be monitored using a rotating spindle-mounted dynamometer with radio-frequency telemetry, high-bandwidth infrared temperature sensors and possibly ultrasonic emission sensors.  The development of predictive models of cutting mechanics and dynamics complements finite-element analyses and experiments.  These models will provide understanding and broad intuition on the effect of machining parameters on cutting process behavior. The work is practically valuable to the manufacture of automotive and aircraft parts.",
