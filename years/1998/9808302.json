 "awd_abstract_narration": "9808302\r\nHowell\r\nDihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is an important enzyme in folate metabolism as its reaction product, tetrahydrofolate, is required for DNA synthesis and other metabolic pathways. The type II R-plasmid encoded DHFR, typified by R67 DHFR, is especially interesting as it is not homologous with chromosomal DHFR.\r\nR67 DHFR is a homotetramer with a monomer length of 78 amino acids,\r\nmaking it one of the smallest enzymes known to self-assemble into an active quaternary structure.  A high resolution crystal structure identifies the central pore as the binding site for both substrate, dihydrofolate, and cofactor, NADPH.  The single active site pore possesses exact 222 symmetry which minimizes the expenditure of energy and DNA in encoding the genetic information.  A disadvantage of this symmetry is the presence of multiple, nonproductive binding modes, e.g. R67 DHFR-2 NADPH and R67 DHFR-2 dihydrofolate, which block formation of the productive complex, R67 DHFR-NADPH-dihydrofolate.  The consequences of this symmetry on binding and catalysis will be explored using NMR and site directed mutagenesis techniques.  Breaking the symmetry of the R67 DHFR active site pore and making asymmetric mutations may allow enhancement of enzyme activity.  Artificial quadruplication of the R67 DHFR gene has produced a single polypeptide possessing the essential structure of tetrameric R67 DHFR.  Single mutations in this construct may allow independent manipulation of each face of the active site pore, facilitating optimal interaction with each individual ligand.\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). This particular protein, R67 DHFR, is encoded by an extra-chromosomal DNA element that can be readily transferred between bacteria.  This study of R67 DHFR addresses the following questions:  how does R67 DHFR catalyze its reaction?  how does enzyme activity evolve? and ultimately, what is the design of potent inhibitors of this DHFR?\r\n\r\n\r\n",
