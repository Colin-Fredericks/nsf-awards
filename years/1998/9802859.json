An affirmative\r\nanswer to this question would constitute a breakthrough in our\r\nunderstanding of the nature of knottedness in three-dimensional space.\r\nMathematical ideas motivated by physical ideas have succeeded in producing\r\na medley of invariants of knots, links, and three-manifolds.  The\r\ninvestigator is in the process of extending these ideas to knotted surfaces\r\nin four-dimensional space and to four-dimensional manifolds.  Here the\r\ndiscovery of new invariants would itself constitute a breakthrough in the\r\nstudy of four dimensions.  Such a breakthrough would have implications for\r\nthe physics of quantum gravity.\r\n     The mathematical study of knots is important not only for its own\r\nsake, but also for its applications to molecular biology and its\r\nrelationships with physics and the foundations of mathematics.  The\r\nresearch indicated in this project is linked with these applications and\r\nwith the use of both computer graphics and expository writing to enlarge\r\nthe discussion of these ideas in both interdisciplinary and educational\r\ncontexts.  By using computer models of knots, one can study questions such\r\nas how the knot will behave if it is coated with electrical charge\r\n(self-repelling knots), how it will appear if it is tied with a least\r\namount of rope for a given diameter, how the geometry of the complement\r\nof the knot appears to an observer flying about in it, how DNA molecules\r\nbehave when moving in their cellular environment.  All these directly\r\nphysical questions are, at levels that we do not yet fully understand,\r\nrelated to the more algebraic methods of the polynomial invariants.\r\nKnots and Nature are inextricably entwined.\r\n***\r\n",
