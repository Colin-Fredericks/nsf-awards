 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scalable signal compression algorithms are required by the evolving communication  network, which is composed of a variety of channels with widely differing static  and dynamic capacities, and by the recent trend toward incremental capacity and  bandwidth reservation channels.  Current multimedia compression algorithms  implicitly assume simple point to point transmission as well as fixed bandwidth  allocation, and result in under-utilization of the network resources.  The  development of truly scalable coders with rate controlled by the local source  statistics, network traffic load, and channel condition will directly impact the  next generation of audio internetworking for multicasting, videotelephone,  videoteleconferencing, and various applications for information retrieval from  multimedia databases.    This research focuses on new audio compression techniques for voice and music  signals, that allow efficient scaling of bit rate and audio bandwidth within the  framework of multimedia compression.  The primary thrust centers on audio signal  modeling with a sinusoidal signal representation, which is bandwidth and rate  scalable and achieves good performance in a variety of coding environments from  low-rate coding of narrow-band speech (2 kb/s) to high-quality coding of audio  signals (16-64 kb/s).  Methods under investigation include sophisticated phonetic  and music classification to allow content-adaptive audio decomposition and  modeling, generalized product code vector quantization, and in particular, multi-  stage vector quantization, to implement scalable quantization techniques.  Inter-  stream optimization for joint compression of audio and video signals is studied  with emphasis on potential applicability to packet transmission and in particular  to TCP/IP Internet protocols.  An important sub-problem is the inter-stream rate  allocation optimization taking into account each stream's level of activity, user  requirements, and sensitivity to quantization and channel errors.  Sourc e-channel  coding and error concealment issues are studied in order to maintain quality of  service requirements under packet losses for both wired and wireless channels.",
