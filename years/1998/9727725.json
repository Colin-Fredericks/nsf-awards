 "awd_abstract_narration": "MCB97-27725  MORAN    As the bacterium Bacillus subtilis differentiates from the vegetative form into a dormant endospore, complex morphological and physiological changes occur which require the sequential expression of many genes.  During the process, new RNA polymerase sigma subunits appear (oF,oE,oG,ok), displacing one another in a sequential cascade and conferring on the RNA polymerase a changing specificity for the recognition of different classes of promoters.  This mechanism of altering transcriptional specificity is a fundamental element in the regulation of sporulation gene expression.  However, during sporulation ancillary transcription factors regulate the use of promoters by RNA polymerase containing the sporulation-induced sigma factors.  These ancillary transcription factors provide an opportunity to use mutational analysis to study their interaction with the sporulation-induced RNA polymerases.  In this project the study of a DNA binding protein (GerE) that functions during sporulation is expected to yield novel insights into the mechanism of this regulator, which is representative of an important class of transcriptional factors found in most bacteria.    GerE is a small, 72 amino acid DNA binding protein that is required for activation of several ok - dependent promoters during the late stage of sporulation.  The amino acid sequence of GerE is homologous to the -35 binding region of RNA polymerase sigma factors, and the DNA-binding region of a family of two-component type response regulators including DegU, ComA, FixJ, and BvgA, and the transcriptional activator MalT.  There is no structural information on this important class of transcriptional activators.  However, the small size of GerE makes it a good candidate for structural analysis.  This research we will use genetic and biochemical approaches to test the hypothesis that GerE interacts directly with ok  at some promoters and with other subunits of ok  RNA polymerase at other promoters to stimulate transcription.  These st udies will complement studies of collaborators in which NMR techniques will be used to determine the structure of GerE.",
