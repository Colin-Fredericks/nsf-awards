 "awd_abstract_narration": "BREEDLOVE, SM  IBN 98-10342    The proposed project will study changes in the structure of  the nervous system that  mediate changes in behavior.  These  experiments take advantage of a model system in which there  is normally occurring plasticity induced by the seasons.  In  seasonal breeders such as the Siberian hamster (Phodopus  sungorus), animals born in the Fall show a much slower pace  of development than do animals born in the Spring.  Likewise, adult animals will, come autumn, undergo a nearly  complete shut down of reproductive systems and then, when  Spring returns, the reproductive system becomes functional  again.  Other researchers have demonstrated that these same  phenomena can be reproduced in the laboratory by  manipulating a single environmental variable: hours of  exposure to light each day.  Most animals will show these  same changes simply by exposing them to either winter-like  short days or summer-like  long days, even if ample food,  water and warmth are provided.  Pilot data   indicate that  such photoperiodic manipulations also affect the structure  and function of spinal motor centers crucial for  reproduction in male hamsters.  Experiments will investigate  how photoperiod affects the structure and function of spinal  motoneurons both in adulthood and in development.  Understanding how benign, non-invasive environmental  manipulations affect neuronal plasticity in these animals  could shed light on neuronal plasticity in other  circumstances and in other species.",
