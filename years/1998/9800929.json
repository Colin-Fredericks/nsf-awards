 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop a representation and algorithms that  characterize diagnostic  reasoning. Human experts in a problem domain frequently interpret data in that domain in the context of a  particular causal hypothesis. This type reasoning contrasts with deductive inference where from a set of  general  rules and facts further information is deduced by sound inference rules. Diagnostic reasoning,  often called abductive inference, however, moves from a set of facts to the \"best explanation\"  for the  existence of these facts. This process often requires the expert to make a hypothetical conjecture that  would explain the facts and then search for specific new information that can  confirm that conjecture.  Thus the human expert searches through a space of possible  explanations for the observed information.  This research uses Bayesian Belief Networks to build  causal models of a domain. This approach  represents in a precise way the interrelationship of  causal patterns and their  use in moving towards an explanation. The research supports handling of  conflicting and ambiguous evidence, as well as a clear method for rating plausible  inferences and the possibility of learning relative strengths of conditional  probabilities from available statistical data. Although the research domain is  built on data from investigation of failures of discrete component semiconductors  as well as the analysis of failure mechanisms in complex real time control,  diagnostic reasoning is a general research area.  Results could be important in  modeling medical decision-making, integrated circuit fault analysis, as well as  used in real time process monitoring and control.  http://www.cs.unm.edu/CS_Dept/faculty/homepage/luge  r/",
