The PI intend to continue research on several aspects of nonlinear  Hamiltonian PDE's. A first line of investigation is the KAM-theory for PDE's   (on bounded domains - assuming periodic boundary conditions say), concerned   with existence and persistency of time periodic and quasi-periodic solutions.   A second theme is the wellposedness theory for the initial value problem with   special emphasis on critical nonlinearity and data of minimal regularity.       The first research direction is closely related to the theory of smooth  dynamical systems (here in infinite dimensional phase space) and localization   theory for lattice Schrodinger operators.  There has been a substantial   technological progress over the recent years leading also to results in higher   space dimension (D > 2), for instance in the construction of time-periodic   solutions and quasi-periodic solutions for 2D NLS.  But these developments are   still in an initial stage and a lot of challenging work needs to be done   involving mainly so-called \"small-dimension\" questions.        The second direction aims to exploit recent advances in Harmonic Analysis  And its interplay with conservation laws and apriori inequalities, in order to   progress on some of the remaining open problems on the Cauchy problem for   certain nonlinear Schrodinger equations for instance, with critical   nonlinearity.  A typical issue are the global wellposedness questions in the   defocusing case for large data.         2. Nonlinear Hamiltonian PDE's such as the nonlinear wave equations   (NLW) and nonlinear Schrodinger equations (NLS) are mathematical models in a   number of issues in physics and engineering.  They are studied by many   distinct groups of scientists, with different emphasis and often different   (mathematical) tools. My interest in this proposal is an analytically purely   rigorous inv estigation. From this point of view NLW (resp, NLS) are the   typical model equations for finite (resp. infinite) speed propagation.  When considering questions of global dynamics, one should distinguish the   case of bounded and unbounded spatial domains where different features should     be expected and the \"natural\" problems (often unsolved) are also distinct.  Of course, a first question to ask is whether the solution exists for all time   and remains smooth in case of smooth data.  Next is the question of long time   behaviour, both for individual data and the dynamics in various phase space.    In the case of bounded domains, we are particularly interested in almost   periodic behaviour.  On the line, due to dispersion, scattering often occurs   and we intend to investigate this phenomenon in certain critical cases.",
