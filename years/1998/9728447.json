 "awd_abstract_narration": "9728447  Hedrick  The long term goal of this research is to determine the macromolecular  composition, the biosynthesis, and the fertilization function of egg  cortical granule components. The macromolecular components of the cortical  granules modify the molecular structure and the supramolecular architecture  of the egg envelope.  This modification maintains the diploid state of the  fertilized egg chromosomes by preventing additional sperm from fusing with  the egg.  The enzyme beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase was identified in the  cortical granules of eggs from the frog Xenopus laevis.  N-acetylglucosamine   residues of the egg envelope glycoproteins may function in sperm binding to   the egg.  Their enzymatic removal may prevent additional sperm from fusing   with egg.  The specific objectives of the research are to provide evidence for   this proposal by: 1) determining the protein structure of the egg enzyme using   recombinant DNA cloning methods, 2) identifying egg envelope glycoproteins that   are substrates for the enzyme, 3) determining the monosaccharide structure(s)   of the carbohydrate moiety of these glycoproteins, and 4) relating this structural   information to its biological role by: a) causing the glycosidic hydrolysis of    envelope glycoproteins with exogenously added enzyme, and b) preventing the  glycosidic hydrolysis of envelope glycoprotein by endogenously released  enzyme using specific inhibitors of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase activity.     This research will identify the molecules involved in sperm-egg binding and  how modification of the envelope glycoproteins by an enzyme released from  the egg alters the structure of the molecules outside the egg. Accomplishing   this research will provide a molecular understanding as to how an egg   enzyme's protein structure determines its specific action on  its egg envelope   substrate, and how glycosidic modification of the envelope prevents sperm-egg   interactions.  From this understanding of the structure-function relations  of the   molecules involved in fertilization may come information relevant to regulating   fertilization and early developmental events.",
