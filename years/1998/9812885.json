 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT: CMS-9812885  Jean-Pierre Bardet, USC    The research projects in geotechnical engineering sponsored by  many  Federal and State agencies and organizations generate a large  amount of  Field and laboratory data concerning the properties of the soil at  a site.  The data and results of these projects are usually released and  distributed  As hard-copy reports, but without the accompanying digital data  from field  and laboratory measurements. The digital data, drawings,  photographs, and  videos generated in these projects are generally stored by the  principal  investigators and, unfortunately, are not systematically  distributed to  other researchers and practitioners. In the era of Internet  communications,  the traditional hardcopy reports only partially communicate the  data; the  absence of the accompanying digital data impedes the verification  and  applicability of research results, limits the return on research  investments from sponsoring organizations and agencies, and delays  progress  and breakthroughs in geotechnical engineering.  The overall objective of this project is the creation of a  Geotechnical  Data Management Center (GDMC) which collects the digital and  graphical data  generated by researchers in geotechnical engineering, and  distributes this  data by means of the Internet. The GDMC will be established at the  University of Southern California, and will link the servers from  other  participating institutions, and those of Internet distribution  systems in  engineering seismology. Examples would be those of the California  Division  of Mines and Geology, and of the US Geological Survey, and  geotechnical  databases such as that for the National Geotechnical  Experimentation Sites.  The GDMC's main function is to catalyze the use of the Internet in  geotechnical engineering, and to coordinate individual efforts.  The GDMC  data will be primarily of a geotechnical nature - e.g., shear wave  velocity  profiles, the results from cone penetration and standard  penetr ation tests,  centrifuge test results, and occasional strong motion recordings.  The immediate objective of this project is to organize a small  meeting to  discuss and plan for the creation and operation of the GDMC. The  main  topics are: (1) the concept of a small oversight committee for the  GDMC,  and (2) the planning meeting to discuss the oversight committee,  its  charter, and operation.  It is expected that the creation of the Geotechnical Data  Management  Center will greatly increase the availability of critical data to  researchers and users, leading to more rapid developments in  earthquake  hazard mitigation.",
