 "awd_abstract_narration": "9805792  Ashby  Temperature has a pervasive effect on many aspects of physiology. Most organisms have evolved adaptations in response to their thermal environment, including thermoregulatory strategies which minimize internal variation in body temperature in the face of large environmental temperature fluctuations. Body temperature affects many traits important to fitness, such as developmental rate, mass, metabolic rate, egg production, and courtship. Despite its obvious importance, very little is known about the genetic determination of body temperature and thermoregulation. Investigations into the evolution of thermoregulation will not be complete without an understanding of the genetic control of body temperature. The purpose of this POWRE award is to determine the feasibility of conducting a quantitative genetic study of on the genetic control of preferred body temperature. To estimate heritability of preferred body temperature, artificial selection experiments will be performed on laboratory populations of a grasshopper species. Metabolic rate, mass, and developmental rate will be measured and genetic correlations with preferred body temperature will be conducted. The results of this research will provide the first estimate of heritability of preferred body temperature in an insect, and these results can be used to assess metabolic efficiency of wild populations of insects. This information is important given the economic effect of insects on crop plants world-wide.",
