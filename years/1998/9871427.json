 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes the acquisition of instrumentation for the  synthesis and purification of short peptides. This  instrumentation will help advance the research program of  the PI involving spectroscopic characterization of model  alpha helices. The infrared (IR) spectra of amide modes of  peptides have long been used to estimate secondary structure  content and describe conformational dynamics. However, the  transition dipole coupling which makes these modes sensitive  to backbone structure also causes these modes to be global  markers about protein structure and limits their application  as specific, local probes. In this study, isotopic labels  introduced into the sequence of model helical peptides will  be used to disrupt transition dipole coupling and to provide  local reporters of peptide structure and environment. These  labels will be used to investigate the effect of helix  capping and helix dipoles on amide I frequency. In addition,  the labeled residues will be used to investigate  folding/unfolding processes of model helices focusing on the  conformation of a particular residue. The basic information  about the effect of local interactions on amide I  frequencies will be the basis for developing methodology to  use IR spectroscopy as a tool for probing of dissecting  specific structural or dynamic properties of proteins. The  peptide synthesis instrumentation will make the pursuit of  this research project more time and cost efficient by making  possible the preparation of isotopically labeled peptides on  site.    Mount Holyoke College, the nation's oldest continuing  liberal arts college for women, has a long history of  educating women for careers in scientific research. A key  component of this tradition is the collaboration between  undergraduate students and faculty on research projects. In  order to best prepare students for future research careers,  undergraduate research programs must give students as much  direct, hands-on experience with the techniques and  instrumentation  as possible. This instrumentation will  enhance the research experience of student collaborators  with the PI by exposing them to important, modern techniques  of biochemistry.",
