 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research under this award investigates connections between geometry \r\nand the mathematical theory of shock waves.  This includes a continuation \r\nof the authors' recent work on developing a mathematical theory of \r\nshock-waves that applies to the Einstein equations - the equations \r\nthat describe the time evolution of spacetime curvature, the gravitational \r\nfield according to general relativity.  Shock waves are relevent here \r\nbecause the compressible Euler equations appear as a subsystem of the \r\nEinstein equations, and emerge exactly in the limit of low velocities \r\nand weak gravitational fields.  The work includes the construction of a \r\nnew cosmological model in which the expansion of the universe, \r\n(as measured by the Hubble constant), is modeled as the effect of a great \r\nexplosion that generates a shock wave at the leading edge, something \r\nlike a nuclear explosion into a static background, except on an enormous scale, \r\ninstead of by the standard cosmological model in which it is assumed \r\nthat the entire universe is expanding at a rate measured by the Hubble law.   \r\nIf successful, the results will provide the first and simplest model for \r\ncosmology under the assumption that the Hubble constant measures only a \r\nlocalized expansion, and consistent with the energy density and background \r\nradiation levels observed in the universe today. This research also has an \r\ninteresting philosophical implication in that, if there were a shock wave present \r\nfrom the Big Bang, then, in contrast to the standard model of cosmology, \r\nthere would be an associated loss of information that would make it \r\nimpossible to reconstruct the details of the initial event from \r\npresent data.  In addition, a covariant version of Glimm's Method will be developed \r\nin an attempt to provide the first general existence theory of shock wave \r\ninteractions for the Einstein equations.  This is a step toward developing \r\nprinciples that can be applied to the numerical simulation of shock waves \r\nin general relativity.  These studies will also have implications for \r\nclassical fluids because the Einstein equations provide a unique setting in \r\nwhich natural geometrical constructs put a handle on the \r\nfluid dynamics.  This work dovetails with ongoing research \r\ninto how the large time behavior of shock wave solutions is related to the \r\ngeometry of the Lie Algebra that gives the scattering picture for\r\nshock wave interactions. Thus this research connects the theory of  \r\nshock waves and geometry on several levels. \r\n\r\nEinstein's equations of general relativity describe the large scale development\r\nof the universe.  Although they were first proposed more than eighty years ago,\r\nthey still pose formidable mathematical challenges.  This research will continue  \r\nearlier work in which exact shock wave solutions of these equations were found.\r\nA mathematical theory will be developed that leads to alternatives of the standard\r\n\"Big Bang\" theory and that allows a general theoretical treatment of shock waves \r\nwithin the general theory of relativity.  Since these equations contain the \r\nclassical fluid dynamics equations as a special case, the research will also lead \r\nto new insights for these more familiar problems. \r\n \r\n",
