 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program,   Professor John I. Brauman, of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford   University, carries out studies of gas-phase ionic chemistry and   spectroscopy.  Through studies of thermodynamics, reaction dynamics,   electron photodetachment spectroscopy, infrared multiple photon induced   reactions, and optical photochemistry, using ion cyclotron resonance   spectroscopy combined with conventional and laser light sources,   Professor Brauman examines the spectroscopic, chemical, and physical   aspects of the properties and reactions of ions in the gas phase.    Through these studies is gained an understanding of the relationship   between structure and reactivity for ions and highly reactive   intermediates, permitting an assessment of the separate contributions of   intrinsic and solvent effects to the chemistry of these species.  A central need in chemistry is the ability to understand and predict the   properties and chemistry of reactive intermediates formed in the course   of chemical reactions.  While molecular groupings bearing charges   (`ions`) play an important role as critical intermediates in numerous   reactions, their properties are dramatically affected by their   interaction with the media in which they are usually generated,   complicating experimental attempts to probe their chemistry.  Professor   John I. Brauman, of the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University,   is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his   studies of the structures and reactivity of ions in the gas phase,   allowing him to assess the separate contributions to their chemistry of   the reaction medium and their intrinsic properties.",
