Particular attention will be\r\npaid to the investigation of the non-local symplectic structures for\r\n2D integrable equations which arise in this way, and to the\r\nHamiltonian theory of finite-dimensional systems equivalent to the\r\npole dynamics of elliptic, trigonometric and rational solutions of 2D\r\nsoliton equations.  Among these systems are spin-generalizations of\r\nCalogero-Moser and Ruijsenaars-Schneider systems. These systems are\r\nrelated to Seiberg-Witten solutions of N=2 supersymmetric gauge\r\ntheories, and have attracted recently considerable interest.  Efforts\r\nwill also be devoted to the clarification of some unexpected relations\r\nbetween Seiberg-Witten solutions of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories\r\nand topological field theories. The moduli spaces of\r\nalgebraic-geometric solutions of soliton equations provide a unifying\r\nframework for these problems.  Seiberg-Witten solutions are related to\r\nthe symplectic geometry of Jacobian bundles over these moduli spaces,\r\nwhile topological field theories are related to their Riemannian\r\ngeometry. The effective Lagrangian in the first case and the free\r\nenergy in the second case are just restrictions of the exponential of\r\nthe tau-function of the universal Whitham hierarchy, which is itself a\r\ncorner stone of the perturbation theory of soliton equations.  It is\r\nvery important to determine whether these relations can be explained\r\nfrom first principles.\r\n\r\nThe algebraic-geometric theory of soliton equations developed in the\r\nmiddle seventies has had enormous influence on many branches of\r\nmathematics and theoretical physics. Originally it was mainly aimed to\r\nconstruct exact solutions of the wide variety of equations describing\r\nwave phenomena in the plasma physics, non-linear optics, oceanology,\r\nsuper-conductivity.  In recent years the universality of the methods\r\nand ideas developed has led to the outreach far beyond the initial\r\nframework. It includes applications to the string theory and\r\nsupersymmetric gauge theories. The new approach to the Hamiltonian\r\ntheory of soliton equations combines all these directions and should\r\nallow us to make the next important step. A development of the\r\nHamiltonian theory of difference equations as a Hamiltonian theory of\r\nsystems with discrete time is a challenging problem which should\r\nprovide a bridge between classical and quantum integrable systems.\r\n",
