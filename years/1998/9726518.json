 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726518  Raber  This award is to support a study to be conducted by the  National Research Council (NRC) to review the roles of the  various federal agencies in planning, constructing, and  operating facilities that provide synchrotron radiation,  neutron beams, and high magnetic field capability for the  study of materials, including biological, structural, and  electronic materials.  The NRC will conduct a study through  consultation with the broader scientific community on the  emerging and anticipated needs for the capabilities these  facilities offer.  Representatives from the academic  community ,industry, and government will be invited to  participate.  The study will recommend guidelines to the  agencies based on the projected scientific and technical  methods needed to characterize materials, and the future  roles of the various agencies in a resource-limited  environment.  The guidelines wil consider collaboration and  coordination between the agencies in planning future  facilities, and will identify means to optimize the roles of  the agencies, the states and the private sector, to make the  most effective use of their respective strengths in the  context of evolving user communities and changing national  and international resources.  The estimated time for  producing a report is one year from the date of this award.  This project is partially supported by the Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities and the Division of Materials  Research at the National Science Foundation, the National  Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Science and  Technology, and the Department of Energy.  ***",
