 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry   Program, investigates the spatial dimension of surface reactions.  Using   scanning tunneling microscopy and UHV spectroscopic techniques, Professor   Reutt-Robey and her coworkers at the University of Maryland-College Park   are exploring self-diffusion events on metallic surfaces and the   interaction of these events with adsorption and reaction processes on   these surfaces.  Hydrogen adsorption on vicinal Al(111) surfaces is used   to probe stepped surface site distributions and adsorption driven step   motion and facetting.  Carbon-carbon coupling reactions of adsorbed   iodobenzene and propyliodide are monitored on the Ag(001) surface in   order to address the questions of reactant ordering and spatial   dependences of reaction probabilities.       In studies of the spatial dependence of surface reactions, Professor   Reutt-Robey is addressing the molecular mechanisms of heterogeneous   catalysis.  Using microscopic and spectroscopic approaches to these   questions, she is able to elucidate the detailed mechanisms of catalyst   step motion induced by reactant adsorption, and the effect of reactant   orientation on the likelihood of a particular reaction occurring.  The   information gained from these studies is useful in developing a detailed   understanding of the technologically important field of heterogeneous   catalysis.",
