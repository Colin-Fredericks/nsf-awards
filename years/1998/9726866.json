 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systems, Computation and Control Engineering have played a key  role in the design and manufacture of products in many plants  such as chemical, mechanical, aerospace, electric, and electronic  industries. Active research on dynamic systems and controls has  been pursued in various disciplines of engineering, and the  education of systems and control engineers is an important issue  in every engineering discipline and every country. The objective  of this workshop is to bring together educators and researchers  from Japan, the United States and Vietnam to discuss the  integration of research and education in the field of systems,  computation and control. The control theory and related areas  such as computations and communications as well as application  problems such as process control, manufacturing and mechanical  systems control will be covered. The workshop will serve as a  spring board for initiating a long lasting cooperation of the  three countries as well as neighboring Asian countries on this  important subject.",
