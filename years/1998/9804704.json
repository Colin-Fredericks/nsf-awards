The program's awards  provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of  unique or complementary facilities, expertise and  experimental conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Michael A. Bisset to work with  Professor Yu-Ping Kuang at Tsinghua University in Beijing,  China on the study of extensions to the Standard Model of  elementary particles, especially the spontaneous symmetry  breaking (Higgs) sector.  Dr. Bisset will pursue efforts to  systematically examine this sector in as model-independent  way as possible.  He is also going to look at Tsinghua  University's efforts to study the technicolor scenarios of  symmetry-breaking.    It is a unique opportunity for a Western physicist to be  invited to work at a university in China.  In addition to  working at Tsinghua, Dr. Bisset will be able to work with  researchers from Beijing University.    ***",
