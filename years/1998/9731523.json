(1) The superfluid phase transition of very thin He-4  films  adsorbed  in  porous materials will be  studied,  using  a  torsion oscillator to measure the superfluid density. This allows  a  measurement  of  the vortex core diameter  in  the  superfluid  films.  The  increase of in the vortex core size with added  He-3  will  be studied, and also the effect on the vortex structure  of  pre-plating  the  substrate with 2-3 atomic layers  of  hydrogen.  Measurements  will  also be undertaken in a  new  porous  ceramic  material,  known as MCM-41, where the pore size of  the  material  can  be varied between 16   and 100   by changing the fabrication  process. Theoretical studies of the vortices in helium films will  be carried out, investigating the effect of a finite supercurrent  on   the  vortex  pairs  at  the  Kosterlitz-Thouless  superfluid  transition.  (2)  A  search  for  sonoluminescence  from  bubbles  acoustically  trapped in cryogenic liquids such as  nitrogen  and  oxygen  will be undertaken, and the oscillation dynamics  of  the  bubbles  will  be studied using laser scattering.  The  cryogenic  liquids  have  the advantages of being pure and inert.  They  are  also more transparent than water in the ultraviolet region, where  most  of the sonoluminescent energy is emitted. (3) Bubbles  will  also be created in liquid helium by injecting electrons into  the  liquid,  forming  multi-electron bubbles large enough  to  become  trapped in the acoustic fields. The bubble radius as function  of  the  electron  number will be measured, and also the  oscillation  dynamics of the bubble.  %%%  This  low  temperature  physics  project  is  composed  of  three  components. (1) The superfluid properties of liquid helium  films  will be studied, with the emphasis on understanding how quantized  vortex  flow  line  in  the  liquid can  bring  the  frictionless  superfluid  flow to a halt. Measurem ents of the fraction  of  the  liquid  helium  that is superfluid will allow  the  size  of  the  vortex  structures  to  be determined.  A  new  type  of  ceramic  materials  will be employed as a substrate for the helium  films,  one  whose pore size can be varied between about 16   and 100   .  Theoretical  studies will be carried out to provide  a  framework  for   interpreting  the  experimental  results.  This  work   has  applications to the High-Tc superconductors, where it is just now  being  understood  that quantized vortex flux lines  are  excited  near  the superconducting transition. These lines have the effect  of bringing to a halt the frictionless flow of the electrons. (2)  A  search for sonoluminescence from bubbles in cryogenic  liquids  such  as  nitrogen  and  oxygen  will  be  undertaken,  and   the  oscillatory motion of the surface of the bubbles will be  studied  using  laser light scattering. The mechanism that results in  the  100  picosecond bursts of light from oscillating bubbles in water  is  still  not  understood, and it is  important  to  find  other  liquids  where  the  phenomenon occurs. The  noble-gas  cryogenic  liquid have the important advantages that they are very pure  and  inert,  and  are  more transparent than water in the  ultraviolet  region  of  the spectrum where most of the light is emitted  from  the bubbles. (3) Bubbles will also be created in liquid helium by  injecting  electrons into the liquid, forming small bubbles  with  up  to several million electrons inside. The radius of the bubble  as  a  function  of the number of electron will be measured,  and  also the oscillatory motion of the bubble surface.  ***",
