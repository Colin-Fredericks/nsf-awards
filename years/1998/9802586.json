 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802586  Orr    This project seeks to advance understanding of the relative role  of kinetics and thermodynamics in GaAs MBE. The approach involves  a combination of experiment and theory to study dynamic processes  on clean GaAs surfaces such as the interactions between surface-  mobile Ga adatoms and As desorption. Experiments include static  annealing to probe As desorption and free Ga dynamics, step  energy measurements under conditions of As or Ga termination, and  step instability studies. Data obtained is expected to help  reveal the relative importance between kinetic processes and  equilibrium thermal fluctuations during film growth.  %%%  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of  materials science having high technological relevance. The  research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a  fundamental level to important aspects of electronic/photonic  devices.  Experimental tools are now available to allow atomic  level observation of basic surface processes which when better  understood will allow advances in both fundamental and  technological arenas. The basic knowledge and understanding  gained from the research is expected to contribute to improving  the performance and stability of advanced devices and circuits by  providing a fundamental understanding and a basis for designing  and producing improved materials, and materials combinations.  An  important feature of the program is the integration of research  and education through the training of students in a fundamentally  and technologically significant area.  ***",
