 "awd_abstract_narration": "9727706  Coe    This grant provides partial support to the University of  Californa-Santa Cruz for the costs of upgrading superconducting  rock magnetometer (SRM) and building an in-line alternating field  (AF) demagnetizer.  The current SRM at UC-Santa Cruz was  purchased in 1985, the third SRM ever built by 2G enterprises.  It suffers from repeated freezing blockages within the liquid  helium plumbing lines, rapid liquid He boil-off rate and an order  of magnitude lower sensitivity than currently available on state-  of-the-art SRM's equipped with DC SQUIDs.  2-G Enterprises will  refurbish this SRM with DC SQUIDs and with improvements in the  plumbing and thermal design that will both reduce operating costs  and increase safety.  The AF demagnetizer will be built in-house.    The increased sensitivity afforded paleomagnetic investigations  through addition of DC SQUIDS will improve the reliability of  paleomagnetic declinations and inclinations calculated for weakly  magnetized rocks and sediments.  Funded tectonic studies in  southern Asia and the eastern California shear zone will  immediately benefit from this upgrade.  Furthermore, the  capabilities of an in-line AF demagnetizer will enable  elimination of secondary component magnetizations in samples that  have been struck by lighting and will prove useful for  paleointensity measurements made on Miocene flood basalts from  Steens Mountain and early Cretaceous flood basalts from the  Parana Basin in Brazil.  These measurements are crucial for  understanding past variations in the geomagnetic field.  ***",
