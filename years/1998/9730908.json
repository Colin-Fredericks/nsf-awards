Well  characterized ferromagnetic tunnel junctions and interfaces  will  be prepared under clean and ultra high vacuum conditions to allow  accurate and reproducible tunneling measurements, particularly on  structures with 3d and 4f ferromagnetic metals. Spin polarization  of  the same films that make up the tunnel junction will also  be  measured  by  superconducting tunneling  spectroscopy.  The  main  thrust  is to understand the physical mechanisms responsible  for  the observed magnetic field sensitivity. It is expected that this  research will additionally lead to new results and techniques  in  condensed  matter  physics  and  new  applications  for  magnetic  technology.This research program is interdisciplinary  in  nature  and  has typically involved several undergraduate and high school  students in its activities. These involvements are beneficial  in  the preparation of students for further study and for careers  in  industry, government laboratories or academia.  %%%  This  experimental research project is concerned with a new class  of   electronic  devices  that  the  PI  has  discovered  in  his  previously supported work, which are highly sensitive to magnetic  field. The electrical resistance of the device, which is called a  tunnel  junction, changes when the device is placed in a magnetic  field,  and is said to exhibit magnetoresistance. This  discovery  has  created  interest  worldwide because of  the  potential  for  improvements  in technology. The main technological  applications  may be in magnetic sensors for computer hard drives, possibly for  magnetic computer memory or logic elements, and for miscellaneous  applications s uch as sensors to measure rotational speeds, eg,  a  tachometer. The basic tunnel junction is a capacitor-like  device  with  a  thin insulating oxide between two metal plates. In  this  case  the oxide layer is so thin that electrons can transfer from  one  plate  to  the  other  by the quantum  mechanical  tunneling  process.  This  process was firmly established and understood  in  detail  in  the  late  1960's by basic  physics  researchers  who  realized that a tunnel junction device, if it could be fabricated  with  a  sufficiently thin and homogeneous oxide layer, could  be  instrumental  to   understanding the nature of superconductivity.  Ivar  Giaever  won the Nobel Prize in Physics  in  1973  for  his  experiments  on  superconductivity  which  were  based   on   his  development  of  improved  fabrication  techniques  and  a   more  complete  understanding  of  the  physical  behavior  of   tunnel  junctions.  The present PI has gone on from these  earlier  basic  research  results  to find the magnetic effects  which  are  very  promising  for  applications in computers and other technologies.  As  in  the earlier case, the PI here has perfected new and  more  careful  experimental methods to clearly reveal the theoretically  expected physical effects, in this case magnetic in nature.  This  project  focuses  on  careful  and  systematic  measurements   on  junction   structures   with  metal   electrodes   of   different  ferromagnetic  compositions, in order to  better  understand  and  maximize the sensitivity to magnetic field. This research program  is interdisciplinary in nature and has typically involved several  undergraduate  and high school students in its activities.  These  involvements  are beneficial in the preparation of  students  for  further   study   and   for  careers  in   industry,   government  laboratories or academia.  ***",
