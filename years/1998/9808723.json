 "awd_abstract_narration": "9808723  POO     During the early development of the nervous  system, the sensory inputs from the environment received by the  central nervous system play a critical role.  Abnormal sensory  inputs result in abnormal development of nerve connections in the  brain.  However, how sensory inputs affect these connections is  poorly understood.  In this project, Dr. Poo and a graduate  student and postdoctoral fellow will use an electrical recording  method that can detect the efficiency of nerve connections in the  intact visual system of the developing frog tadpole.  In  particular, they will examine how nerve connections from the  retina to its major target in the brain, the tectum, are affected  by electrical activity in the visual inputs.  In Part I of the  project, they will determine how repetitive activity induced by  electrical stimulation of retinal neurons affects the efficiency  of the synaptic connections between the retina and tectum, or  retino-tectal synapses.  The patterns of electrical activity and  the cellular mechanisms that produce long-term changes in  efficiency, namely long-term potentiation and/or depression (LTP &  LTD) will be examined.  In Part II, they will use light stimuli to  initiate localized retinal activity and examine whether  physiological visual stimuli can induce LTP or LTD of retino-  tectal synapses, and if so, how these light-induced synaptic  modifications relate to those produced by direct electrical  stimulation.  In Part III, they will carry out simultaneous  electrophysiological and optical recording of identified retino-  tectal projections in the tectum, using a newly developed high-  resolution microscopic technique called two-photon laser scanning  fluorescence microscopy.  They will determine whether and how  electrical and visual stimuli shape the pattern of axonal  processes of retinal ganglion neurons and dendritic processes of  the postsynaptic tectal cells.  This project offers unique  opportunities for direct examination of the effects of se nsory  activity on the structure and function of synaptic connections in  an intact visual system.  The information obtained will be  valuable to our understanding of the development of vertebrate  visual systems and plasticity of neuronal connections in general.",
