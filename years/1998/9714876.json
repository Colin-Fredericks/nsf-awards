Berger  Proposal Number: DMS 9714876  Project: Group Travel Award to the 6th Valencia International Meeting            on Bayesian Statistics     Abstract:     The Sixth International Valencia Meeting on Bayesian Statistics will be   held from May 30 - June 4, 1998, in Las Fuentes, Spain. This series of   international Valencia meetings has long been the major venue for   presentation and dissemination of research on Bayesian statistical   methodology and its applications. The Bayesian approach to statistics   has experienced astonishing growth in recent years, driven in large   part by its ability to solve difficult applied statistical problems in   science, engineering, and society in general.     This group travel award is in support of expenses of participants from  the United States. Participation in this meeting is crucial   for researchers, especially new researchers, as the pace and breadth of   developments in the area is making it increasingly difficult to monitor  the field. By attending the meeting, researchers will be able to acquire   the latest Bayesian techniques, and will have ample opportunity to   obtain feedback on their own work. A large portion of the grant will go   towards expenses of graduate students, new researchers, and members of   underrepresented groups. In addition, special activities for students   and new researchers will be instituted, in part to initiate   international interactions and collaborations.",
