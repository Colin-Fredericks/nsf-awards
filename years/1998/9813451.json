The conference is designed to bring together both marine and land scientists for  discussion of multidisciplinary studies involving the nature and origin of the oceanic crust. Emphasis will be placed on integrating recent Ocean Drilling Program drilling results from a variety of oceanic environments with recent studies of ophiolitic land analogues, with special emphasis on results from the Oman and Troodos ophiolites. Specific ODP results to be discussed include those resulting from drilling in upper oceanic crust near a mid-ocean ridge (Costa Rica Rift), tectonic exposures of middle to lower oceanic crust and mantle (Mid-Atlantic Ridge, Hess Deep, and Southwest Indian Ridge), and tectonic environments associated with oceanic volcanic arcs (Lau Basin, Tonga forearc, and Izu-Bonin-Mariana forearc and backarc).  This Penrose Conference will augment the objectives and activities of the ODP Architecture of the Oceanic Lithosphere Program Planning Group.  It will consist of a three day meeting for 70 participants, followed by a fieldtrip and a day of informal discussions, to be held 9/13/98-9/17/98.  ***",
