 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal No.: 9732219  PI:  Schoenig  University: Cleveland State U      ABSTRACT      The Advanced Manufacturing Center at Cleveland State University is proposing to provide undergraduate manufacturing engineering research experiences to students whom are seeking a Bachelor's degree in Science or Engineering.  Participants will be recruited from among CSU students as well as students at three regional community colleges who have committed to four year baccalaureate programs.  Many of these students will be participants in the dual admission program.  Dual enrolled students carry out their first two years of study at the community college before completing their BS degree at CSU.  The focus of this applied research is manufacturing innovations.    The goals of the program are to attract and retain highly motivated students into manufacturing engineering careers, to offer an early introduction to research for lower level undergraduate students from CSU and regional community colleges, to use these experiences to assist community college students in their transition into the university environment, to better prepare students for entry into the manufacturing field, and to recruit students for advanced engineering studies.    Research projects cover various aspects of manufacturing engineering and are designed to prepare individuals to develop innovative solutions to long-standing manufacturing problems.  Research teams will consist of faculty, staff engineers, graduate and undergraduate students and, in some cases, high school students.  The teams will usually be cross-functional.  Students will have the opportunity to participate during the summer and/or throughout the academic year for a total of 600 hours per year.  Participants will be encouraged to continue in the program through their transfer from a community college into the university.    The project will include an optional ethics component.  Two separate modules will be offered to address basic and more complex ethical issues.  In additi on, a framework will be developed in which students will identify potential ethical issues in their own manufacturing research projects and will share their findings with other participants.",
