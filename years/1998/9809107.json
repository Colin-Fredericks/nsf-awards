 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1940, Robert Merton launched a new approach to organization theory. Whereas Weber had focused on the role of formal structures (such as job descriptions, authority relationships, and career ladders) in designing efficient organizations, Merton challenged both the focus on formal structures and the conclusion of efficient performance. In the 1950s and '60s, Merton's students and their contemporaries undertook detailed, first-hand observations of organizations and wrote books describing and analyzing what they saw (see Blau (1955), Crozier (1963), Dalton (1959), Gouldner (1954), and Selznick (1949), for example). These books confirmed that many organizations do not exhibit the `precision, speed, expert control, continuity, discretion, and optimal returns on input` (Merton, 1940: 561) of Weber's ideal type, and that informal structures (such as quid pro quos, shared understandings, and relationships not shown on the organization chart) are at least as important as formal structures in many organizations. Furthermore, these books showed two roles for informal structures: in some cases, they subverted the organization's rational design; in others, they inspired superior organizational performance.  In the 1970s, organizational sociology had begun to shift its focus from life inside organizations to the relationship between an organization and its environment. Today, this transformation is essentially complete: two of the strongest sub-fields are population ecology and institutional theory, both of which typically treat the firm as a black box, and even network theory focuses more often on networks between firms (again treated as black boxes) than on networks of people within firms.  In economics, the last 25 years saw a different transformation, in which the theories of information, incentives, games, and contracts developed rapidly. I believe it is now time to revisit the sociological evidence on life inside organizations by developing models rooted in these new economic theories. (I also wonder whether one reason sociologists stopped working on these issues was that they ran out of new ways to make progress. Now we have one.)  This suggestion may not seem new: in the last five years there have been many papers in the emerging area of organizational economics. But much of this theorizing seems to have taken place in an empirical vacuum. In particular, I fear that many organizational economists have been exposed to no organizations other than universities! In an attempt to avoid this fate myself, I have developed a deep relationship with one organization (Citibank). In this proposal I seek support for a second approach: I would like to read and model the accounts of other first-hand observers of organizations, including those from the organizational sociology literature of the '50s and '60s, as well as more recent accounts that straddle the business and academic literatures (such as Bower (1970), Eccles (1985), and Gerlach (1991)).  My limited reading of accounts by first-hand observers suggests that this research strategy may be enormously fruitful. For example, the proposal describes an argument by Crozier (1964) that was reinvented by Milgrom and Roberts (1988). My point is neither that such subsequent formal modeling by economists has no value nor that informal arguments by non-economists have no value until they are formalized. Rather, my point is simply that anyone who anticipates the economics literature by two decades merits further attention.  Because I have not yet read much, I cannot say much about the models I will develop. In this proposal, therefore, I give two examples of my prior work to suggest that the proposed research is both feasible and valuable. The first example is drawn from `Taking Coase Seriously,` an essay I wrote about (second-best) inefficient organizations at the request of the Administrative Science Quarterly (the leading journal in organization theory). The second example is drawn from Baker, Gibbons, and Murphy (1997), which combines Simon's (1951) conception of relational contracting with Grossman and Hart's (1986) definition of integration as asset ownership. The second example shows that formal and informal organizational structures not only co-exist but also interact, and hence that optimal organizational design involves choosing the formal design to facilitate useful informal interactions.",
