 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9761615  Bhandari    This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop single source,cost-effective lanthanum precursors for the structural composite industry.  Oxide fibers within intermetallic or oxide matrices are being actively investigated for high temperature applications.  LaPO4 is a coating with excellent potential for both intermetallic and oxide matrices.  Such interface coatings are critical, but their development has suffered from extremely high per pound costs and coating uniformity issues.  The project will provide lanthanum precursors that address both these issues. Phase I will demonstrate chemistry, liquid source delivery, atmospheric pressure CVD, and continuous (multifilament) fiber coating technologies for the deposition of LaPO4 coatings on aluminum oxide fibers.  Coated fibers will be evaluated and processed into matrix composites.  Phase II will address process optimization for a selected coating, in conjunction with processing by a composite manufacturer.    An economical lanthanum CVD precursor for producing high-quality LaPO4 coatings on continuous, multifilament fiber tows will enjoy an unfulfilled market niche.  Applications of the research include power generation systems, aircraft engines and hazardous waste incinerators.   ***",
