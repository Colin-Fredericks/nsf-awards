 "awd_abstract_narration": "9811489  Lilley         This is project is a rapid response to an seismic event  on Axial seamount on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Starting  January 28, 1998, a seismic event was detected using the T-  phase monitoring system developed by NOAA/PMEL toaccess the  US Navy's SOSUS arrays.  Over 6000 earthquakes were detected  in the first five days of the event, making this the most  intense seismic event yet observed in this area.  The  character of this seismicity is very similar to that  observed at CoAxial segment and the Northern Gorda Ridge,  both episodes that were later confirmed to be eruptive  events.       This proposal is to mount a rapid response cruise on  the R/V Wecoma. The objectives are to: (1) detect and  characterized events plume(s) and other venting associated  with seismic event, (2) to deploy neutrally buoyant drifter  buoys (RAFOS floats) and associated sound source array for  tracking an  event plume, (3) establish whether there has  been a subsurface bacterial bloom, (4) advance time-series  measurements of geochemical and microbial concentrations and  activities in megaplume and event-initiated plumes, and (5)  deploy ocean bottom hydrophones.",
