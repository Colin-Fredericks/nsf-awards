 "awd_abstract_narration": "9720411  LeMasurier  The volcanoes of Marie Byrd Land lie along the Pacific coast  of Antarctica between 110 degrees and 140 degrees west  longitude, and are part of the circum-Pacific ORing of  Fire.O  They have formed during the past 30 million years  (Ma); but each has had an individual lifetime of less than 3  Ma, and they are made up of a wide variety of rock types.  Unlike volcanoes elsewhere in the Ring of Fire, which have  formed as a result of plate collision, Marie Byrd Land  volcanoes have formed in a OriftO environment where the  earthOs crust has been stretching, fracturing, and slowly  rising to form a large dome that is now about 300 miles in  diameter and 9,000 feet above sea level at its crest.  Older  volcanoes are found near the center of the dome, and as the  dome grew, volcanic activity shifted toward the edge of the  dome, where the now active volcanoes are located.  The  origin of these volcanoes thus appears to involve an  interplay between melting, that produces the original lava  far below the crust, and deformation within the crust, that  seems to control what happens to the lava on its way to the  surface.  When the lava reaches the surface, and is erupted  under the West Antarctic ice sheet, it produces  hydrovolcanic deposits that provide a record of how the size  of the ice sheet varied before climate was influenced by  human activity.  At Mt. Takahe these rocks appear to record  multiple fluctuations in ice level, through a range of at  least 1,000 ft. within the past 300,000 years, suggesting  that the ice sheet responds readily to climatic change.  A  similar response to greenhouse warming could, conceivably,  lead to a 20 foot rise in sea level.    This award, funded by the Office of Polar Programs at the  National Science Foundation, supports work that will focus  on the following questions:  (1)  What has caused melting at  roughly 70-90 miles depth to produce basalt lava, and how  have uplift and stretching been related to this process?  (2) What processes h ave caused the basalt to change  composition as it rises to the surface, producing the  variety among volcanoes in Marie Byrd Land?  (3)  What can  we learn from hydrovolcanic deposits about the history of  the ice sheet and its vulnerability to greenhouse warming?    This award supports a comparative petrological study to  understand the volcanic rocks of Marie Byrd Land in the  context of similar volcanic provinces elsewhere in the world  that exhibit different styles or stages of development.  This award supports comparative studies of three such  regions:  (1) The volcanoes of Victoria Land, about 1000  miles west of Marie Byrd Land, in a part of the West  Antarctic rift that has had a somewhat different history of  deformation and volcanism.  (2)  The 60-65 million year old  volcanoes in NW Scotland, which have been eroded deeply  enough to expose subsurface volcanic conduits.  (3)  Volcanoes produced by subglacial eruptions in Iceland,  including the active volcano Grimsvotn, which has produced  hydrovolcanic deposits like those at Mt. Takahe during its  recent eruptions under the glacier Vatanajokull.  These  studies are important because they will contribute to an  understanding of (1) how the interplay between deep internal  processes and crustal deformation within Earth can control  the development of volcanoes in a rift environment, and (2)  how the past behavior of the West Antarctic ice sheet can be  used as a key to its future stability.",
