Dr.  Muntean will work with Dr. Jeffrey Hedenquist, Senior  Scientist, Mineral and Fuel Resources Department, on a  research project entitled \"Magmatic-Hydrothermal Fluids in  the Ore Deposits and Active Geothermal Systems.\"    The proposed research project will focus on the continuum  model for magmatic-hydrothremal fluids, both for active  volcanic-hydrothermal systems and or deposits, which will be  tested from a variety of directions with a variety of  approaches--active versus extinct systems, exposures from  the surface through shallow to great depth, and using field-  based geological study plus laboratory-based geochemical  work.  Magmatic-hydrothermal processes reflect the physical  and chemical interactions between magma bodies, the  surrounding rocks, and Earth's hydrosphere.  Significant  progress has been made in the last dozen years on  identifying and understanding magmatic-hydrothermal  processes in volcanoes, geothermal systems, and ore  deposits.  The recent progress points to a continuum of  magnatic-hydrothermal fluids ranging from magmatic aqueous  fluids with little external input through to fluids of mixed  heritage that results from complex interactions between  magmatic aqueous fluids, rocks , and aqueous fluids of  surficial origin.  These magmatic-hydrothermal fluids play a  major role in cycling of the earth's elements in the upper  crust.  Increased understanding of magmatic-hydrothermal  fluids and processes has profound implications in assessment  of volcanic hazards, development of geothermal energy, and  the exploration and development of hydrothermal metallic ore  deposits.  ***",
