 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator  explores several problems in  approximation theory with special interest in applications  of potentials and in polynomials. One of these topics   is polynomial approximation with varying weights. Recently   several problems have lead to this type of approximation,   and the PI continues its study with the help of logarithmic  potentials in the presence of an external field. This  approximation problem is fundamental in proving different  types of asymptotics for orthogonal polynomials and  Christoffel functions with respect to varying weights.  These in turn are related to some mechanical models of  quantum physics, in particular to the  universality  hypothesis (saying that the distribution of energy levels in  small intervals is independent of the original (random)  distribution of the particles). Another related problem is  on orthogonal polynomials with respect to a measure with  compact support on the complex plane (bounds for  polynomials, regularity criteria, Szego's problem on  curves or disjoint intervals). Finally, the PI plans to  investigate polynomial inequalities with as general weights  as possible. Recently it has turned out that classical  polynomial inequalities are also true in weighted form, and  for a surprisingly wide class of weights, namely for so  called doubling weights, or for weights satisfying the  weakest of the Muckenhoupt A conditions. The PI further  investigates  weighted polynomial inequalities, as well as  their consequences in other areas.      This research project deals with some theoretical  questions of mathematical analysis with the aim of  using in more applied areas of mathematics and  theoretical physics. Some basic problems in approximation  theory are investigated with tools that have been  traditionally associated with classical physics (potential  theory). This novel application of potential theory  makes it possible to attack problems that resisted  classically applied tools, e.g. it makes possible to  find the behav ior of some nonclassical orthogonal  polynomials (Freud polynomials). A new impulse to the  research came in recent years when it has been found that  these orthogonal polynomials are related to some questions  of theoretical physics that are modelling the uncertain  nature of quantum systems by random mechanical models.  Another major area of research is on weighted inequalities  on polynomials. Polynomials are basic tools in replacing   complicated structures by simpler ones that can be  mathematically handled; and in this approximation process  one needs various inequalities that relate various  quantities of polynomials to one another.",
