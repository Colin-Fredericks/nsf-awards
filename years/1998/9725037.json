 "awd_abstract_narration": "Allen  9725037  This is a renewal award to conduct theoretical research on  metallic, or nearly metallic, oxides and on glasses.    The normal modes of thermal vibration in glassy solids have  been characterized in computer studies of up to 4096 atoms.  These models yield realistic vibrations for amorphous  silicon.  Four new projects are planned: (1) Clarify the  concept of diffusivity of normal modes; (2) Find connections  between low energy \"resonant\"modes and low energy structural  rearrangements which couple strongly to the resonant modes;  (3) Develop a theory of the viscosity of the thermal  vibrations and apply this to the study of internal friction  in glasses; (4) Develop a new theory of hopping conduction  of heat when localized states are concentrated.    Although most important oxides are insulating, some are very  good metals and the most interesting ones are on the  borderline.  The transition from metallic to insulating has  usually two equally strong and very different driving  forces, Coulomb correlation and lattice distortion.  The  former causes great theoretical difficulty even in the  simplest fully interacting model, whereas the latter,  solvable in principle, has multiple manifestations depending  on the chemical species and crystal structure.  A study of  BaBiO3, where Coulomb effects are minimal, is currently  being completed.  To extract the common physics of many  oxides, a simplified model due to Rice and Sneddon is used,  where the only lattice degrees of freedom is the  displacement of oxygen atoms parallel to the metal-oxygen  bond.  This not only captures the breathing distortion that  drives the Bi(3+)/Bi(5+) disproportionation (and causes  insulating behavior), but also captures the principle Jahn-  Teller displacement which couples to the metal-insulator  behavior of Eg metals and T2g metals and many isoelectronic  materials.  %%%  This theoretical research will continue studies of metal  oxide materials and their unusual properties.  These  materials are intr iguing due to their widely varied  properties.  Some conduct electricity, like normal metals,  while others are insulating.  Some are on the borderline  between metallic properties and insulating properties.  The  research supported by this grant will investigate this  difficult, but technologically important class of materials.  ***",
