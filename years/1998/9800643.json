 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800643 Fernando This is an award to provide support for research on minimizing the environmental impact of a process for decontamination of soil that had been contaminated by use of mercury in extracting gold and silver from ores mined in the United States and Mexico.  The work involves collaboration with Dr. Tetsuya Ogura of the Autonomous University of Guadalajara in Mexico on soils obtained from contaminated sites in Zacatecas, Mexico.  The process currently in use there involves treatment of soil contaminated by these metals with an aqueous solution of calcium thiosulfate produced by passing sulfur dioxide through an aqueous suspension of lime and elemental sulfur.  The resultant solution of metal contaminants is contacted with metals that precipitate elemental mercury containing amalgamated gold and silver which can be extracted from the amalgam by heating it to vaporize the mercury.  Process control is important to avoid its potential pollutional impact on air, water and soil. \r\n\r\nResults of this project are expected to provide knowledge as to how the process being studied can be designed and conducted to obtain its benefits and minimize its potential negative environmental impact.  Research will also identify the advantages and disadvantages of the process over currently available alternative technologies for removing mercury from soil.  This project is being partially supported through a program of collaboration with the Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT) of Mexico.\r\n***\r\n",
