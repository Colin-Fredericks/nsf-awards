 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726331  Doyle    This award supports the participation of American scientists  and engineers in a U.S.-Japan seminar on Robust Virtual  Engineering, to be held in Pasadena, California, from  October 5-10, l998.  The co-organizers are Professors John  Doyle of the California Institute of Technology and Hidenori  Kimura of the University of Tokyo in Japan.  The seminar  will undertake a study of  Robust Virtual Engineering.  The  objective is to focus on constructing a theoretical basis  for virtual engineering and complex systems.  The use of  \"virtual engineering\" suggests both a broader and more  focused concept than \"modeling and simulation.\"  It also  makes explicit the role of analysis, insight, understanding,  design, and decision-making.  The seminar will focus on  physics-based complex systems.    Physicists typically do not develop their models so that  they can be incorporated naturally as elements of a larger  system.  Engineers typically design systems using methods  which are cautious and robust, but without relying on  detailed physical descriptions of the components.  The  session will focus on encouraging the incorporation of more  detailed physical descriptions at just the right time and in  just the right place for a much more realistic picture of  the ultimate limitations associated with the performance of  the system.  It is expected that the interactions between the engineers  and physicists should assist in better planning for the  future of  virtual engineering and complex systems.  The  exchange of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this  field will enable U.S. participants to advance their own  work, and will set the stage for future collaborative  projects.  Seminar organizers have made a special effort to  involve younger scientists.  The proceedings of the meeting  will be made available on the World Wide Web.  ***",
