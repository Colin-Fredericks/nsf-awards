 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program   of the Chemistry Division, Heaven will continue his studies of the   spectroscopy and dynamics of the pre-reactive van der Waals complexes   H2-CN and CN-HCl.  He will use fluorescence excitation and   optical-optical double resonance techniques to probe the ro-vibronic   structures of H2(D2)-CN(A) and -N(B).  In particular, he will examine the   predissociation dynamics of the A state complex.  In addition, Heaven   will investigate vibrationally excited levels of H2(D2)-CN(X) using   stimulated emission pumping (SEP) and stimulated Raman excitation (SRE)   techniques.  In collaboration with Morokuma and Bowman, Heaven proposes   to calculate ab initio potential energy surfaces for the ground and   excited states of CN-H2.  Finally, he proposes studies of the   predissociation dynamics of CN-Rg  and (N2+)-Rg (Rg= Ne or Ar).  The study of weakly bound van der Waals complexes is one of the frontier   areas of contemporary physical chemistry.  While numerous van der Waals   complexes formed by stable (called `closed shell`)  molecules have been   investigated, the study of such complexes in which one of the component   members is a radical (molecular fragment or `open shell` system) is still   in its early stages.  Theoretical models developed for the bonding   interactions in closed shell van der Waals complexes are not applicable   to open shell systems.  This research provides an important data base for   open shell van der Waals complexes that aids the development of   theoretical models of these systems.  The results of this research are of   direct relevance to work on collisional processes involving open shell   diatomics which is currently pursued in several laboratories and have   applications in atmospheric and industrial processes.",
