 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year study will conduct basic methodological research into longitudinal and semiparametric statistical techniques applicable to the general problem of environmental justice.  In the process it will demonstrate methodological applicability on data from metropolitan New York City.  The overall goal is to define and disseminate statistically sound methods for studying the issues of environmental justice, including methodology that: (1) utilizes the geographic nature of the data, (2) evaluates and accounts for the social-economic status (SES) of the population in addition to racial variation, and (3) incorporates important temporal information.  The larger issue in this research is attempting to get beyond the reliance on association for causal inference commonly encountered in simple cross-sectional models.  In the past, a significant amount of this type of analysis has been conducted under the banner of environmental justice or environmental equity.  However, these studies fail to answer the true question of interest: Were minority populations unfairly imposed upon by design?  That is, did society place hazardous, polluting, or otherwise environmentally unfriendly sites in minority neighborhoods because they were minority neighborhoods?  A key element of the problem is the question of who was there first, the site or the minority community?  Secondarily, if the minority community was there first, was that community unfairly imposed upon at that time in relation to the rest of the region?  These questions must be adequately answered first before environmental injustice can be claimed.",
