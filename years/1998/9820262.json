These services include the following: (1) support for implementation of K-12 science and mathematics curriculum standards, for integration of the use of educational technology into the delivery of mathematics and science, for development of a high quality instructional workforce, and for implementation of a standards-based student assessment system in the USI/CPMSA sites; (2) help in developing community understanding of and resources for systemic reform in all of the SI programs; (3) support for the development of a plan to provide high quality science and mathematics instruction in all RSI sites; and, (4) building linkages between present SSIs and alumni SSIs and other states.  The RFP also requires TMG to develop a plan to use electronic media to increase the ability of all SI award sites to share best practices and solve problems they have in common.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
