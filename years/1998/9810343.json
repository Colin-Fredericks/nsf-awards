 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term objective of the research is to understand the mechanisms that generate the spatial organization of the multiple cell types found within an organism.  This question will be addressed by utilizing the legs of the Drosophila melanogaster adult as a model system.  The epidermal structures of Drosophila adult legs exhibit a precise organization, the most notable feature of which are the rows of small bristles that alternate with bristleless cuticle.  This pattern is established in part through the function of the hairy (h) gene, which in pupal legs is expressed in four longitudinal stripes in regions corresponding to primordia of bristleless cuticle.  Two longitudinal stripes are expressed along the dorsal/ventral (D/V) axis (D/V-h stripes), and the other two traverse the anterior/posterior (A/P) axis (A/P-h stripes).  h patterns the leg bristle rows by regulating the periodic expression of the proneural gene achaete (ac).  In the pupal leg disc, a stripe of ac expression on either side of each h stripe defines the primordia of the leg bristle rows.  In the absence of h function, ac expression expands into the domains normally occupied by h, resulting in disorganized bristle rows in the adult.  Thus, proper regulation of h expression is fundamental to patterning of the leg bristle rows.  As such, study of the regulation of the spatial and temporal pattern of h and ac expression in the developing leg should provide insight into the mechanisms by which leg pattern is produced.",
