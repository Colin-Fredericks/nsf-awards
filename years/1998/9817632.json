Wayne Clough\r\n  \r\nThe attached proposal describes the Facilitating Academic Careers in Engineering and\r\nScience (FACES) program, a collaborative effort between the Colleges of Engineering and\r\nScience at the Georgia Institute of Technology, -Morehouse College, and Spelman College\r\ndesigned to significantly increase the number of African American students receiving doctoral\r\ndegrees in engineering and science fields and ultimately increase the number of these individuals\r\nentering the professorate.  At steady state, we expect the FACES program to produce\r\nten additional African American doctoral recipients per year, thereby doubling Georgia Tech's\r\ncurrent output.  A major advantage of FACES will be the intimate involvement of Georgia\r\nTech's African American faculty in all aspects of the program.\r\n\r\nThe FACES program is comprised of several inter-related components, each of which\r\naddresses critical steps along the path to an academic career.  First, undergraduate students\r\nwho have completed their junior year will be provided summer and academic year research\r\nexperiences as a means of promoting their interest in research and graduate school attendance.\r\nThese students, as well as other worthy candidates, will then be encouraged to enroll in graduate\r\nprograms using a series of recruitment efforts at national events such as the National\r\nSociety of Black Engineers Annual Convention, campus visits and tours, and a\r\nlecture/workshop series on the merits of graduate school and careers in academia.  Admitted\r\ngraduate students will then be supported as FACES Doctoral Fellows throughout their matriculation through graduate school.  A portion of these funds will be used to support travel to\r\ntechnical meetings for research presentations.  Finally, senior doctoral students will compete\r\nfor faculty coupons which they may use to assist them in establishing their research programs\r\nin their initial academic appointments.\r\n\r\nInstitutionalization of the FACES program will be facilitated by the establishment of\r\nendowed faculty chair positions at each of the participating institutions.  These chairs, which\r\nwill be filled on a rotating basis with a five-year term, will serve as directors of the FACES\r\nmanagement team and eventually be responsible for supervision of FACES activities, planning\r\nnew initiatives, program evaluation, and student tracking.  The chairs will be assisted in program\r\nmanagement activities by the staff of the Office of Minority Educational Development\r\n(OMED) office at Georgia Tech.  The chaired positions will provide the long-term leadership\r\nnecessary to continue oversight of FACES after NSF funding ends.\r\n\r\nAs demonstration of institutional commitment to the success of the FACES program,\r\nGeorgia Tech will provide $380,000 over the five-year period of the NSF award to enable the\r\nFACES Doctoral Fellows to complete their degree requirements.  Georgia Tech, Morehouse,\r\nand Spelman will also cost-share by performing the tasks necessary to solicit sufficient funds\r\nfor the establishment of four chair positions (approximately $1.5M per chair).  Thus, the total\r\nlevel of institutional cost-sharing over the life of the program will be approximately\r\n$6,380,000.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
