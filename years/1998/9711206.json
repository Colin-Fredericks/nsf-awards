 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physical and biological processes are historically considered to be  the most  important  factors affecting the carbon cycle in the  ocean.  Specific processes  include  air-sea CO2 exchange, surface mixing,  venting  of  deep waters,  carbon  fixation,  respiration,  calcium  carbonate  formation  and sedimentation. Recent   studies   now   suggest  that   light-initiated (photochemical)  processes also strongly impact  carbon cycling  at  the  sea surface,  particularly  with  respect to the  photodegradation  of  dissolved organic  carbon  (DOC)  and  the  production of  bacterial  substrates.  The evidence for the importance of  photochemical oxidation of aged, biologically refractory DOC includes: 1)  irradiation of sterile-filtered seawater results in  high production rates  of COz, CO and biologically utilizable substrates, 2)  low  productivity  central gyres appear to be net  heterotrophic  (i.e., bacterial  C  utilization rates often exceed primary productivity rates),  3) bacterial  C  utilization rates are estimated to be about the  same  as  the  production  rate of biologically labile substrates from DOM  photodegradation in  open oceanic surface waters, and 4) a significant  fraction of the carbon assimilated  by open ocean bacteria in surfaces  waters is isotonically  old. Despite  this  strong evidence the  quantitative importance of photochemistry in the oceanic carbon cycle is  still unknown.           Studies will focus on: (1) the photochemical production of CO2 and    CO from  marine DOM, (2) the photochemical loss of DOC, and (3) the    microbial uptake  and  remineralization of photooxidized DOM.  Results    will  assess the  impact  of  photochemistry on carbon fluxes and    organic  carbon  mass balances   in   the            water  column,    including  primary    and   bacterial    productivities,   microbial  respiration  and,  at   the   BATS  station,    particulate   carbon   fluxes.   We  expect   Bacterial   utilization    of photooxidized,  aged  DOM  may  largely explain  the  apparent    discrepancy between  high  bacterial C utilization rates and low primary    productivity rates  that  have  been  frequently observed for low    productivity  waters. Another  important goal of this study is to    develop algorithms,  based  on action   spectra,  DOM  absorbance  and    surface  irradiance,  to  predict photochemical  rates  in surface    waters. These algorithms  in  combination with  remotely sensed DOM    fluorescence to Predict CO2 and CO photochemical production  and DOC    photodegradation rates over large areas of the  ocean. Previous    successes in studying photochemical processes in  a  variety  of marine    environments  gives  a  strong  foundation  for      assessing    the    importance of these processes in the oceanic carbon cycle.",
