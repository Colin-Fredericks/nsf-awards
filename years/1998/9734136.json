Colorado School of Mines    Structure at small length scale arises as the material microscopic components interact and assemble themselves into mesoscopic-sized morphologies.  This project will investigate the link between molecular interactions and the properties of interfaces that develop during morphology evolution.  A combination of dense colloidal model systems probed by new optical techniques that can manipulate such systems, and statistical mechanical modeling methods will be applied.  A new experimental device will be constructed that uses a rapidly scanning optical trap to build arbitrary optical potential wells. The technique of confocal microscopy which can characterize, in situ, the relatively dense colloidal structures will be developed.  The study of nucleation in systems using nuclei of various structure and the templated growth of colloidal crystals will be two areas of focus.      The education goal is to bring the physical insights obtained in this study to the classroom at both undergraduate and graduate levels by developing new courses and adding molecular level material to current coursework.  In addition, new pedagogical techniques including the World Wide Web, browsers used to access the web, as well as state-of-the-art computer languages will be used to enhance the educational environment.    Understanding the link between microscopic interactions in colloidal systems and macroscopic properties is an essential step in the synthesis of new materials with specifically designed microscale morphologies.  ***",
