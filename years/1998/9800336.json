 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Consortium for Educational Equity at Rutgers University, an affiliate of the Center for Math, Science, and Computer Education is undertaking activities for the development, field-testing, and evaluation of Special Science Teams (SST), a professional development program for teachers of students with special needs.  Targeting grades 3-5, SST is integrating exciting hands-on environmental science activities, equity-focused cooperative learning strategies and physical and pedagogical modification in an effort to provide teachers with the skills and knowledge necessary to encourage all children science, regardless of disability.\r\n\r\nInspired by the success of the original SST model, which has been highly effective in promoting gender and racial equity in elementary science classrooms, SST was created to address the underrepresentation of persons with disabilities in science careers.  The program seeks to overcome many of the barriers which contribute to the loss of interest and confidence in science experienced by students with disabilities including lack of exposure to science, negative stereotypes, and lack of encouragement in science.  By providing general and special education teachers with a comprehensive approach including equity-based cooperative learning techniques, specific strategies for modifying hands-on science activities, standards-based environmental science curriculum, disability equity training, and support for ongoing collaboration, SST is creating a synergy within participating districts who will utilize the expertise of all of their faculty.  As part of the project, SST will also be included in the pre-service education courses at the College of New Jersey, so that future teachers will be prepared to include all children in science.  SST targets grades 3-5 in an effort to reach students at a time when essential scientific concepts are first introduced, and developmentally, children are beginning for form lifelong opinions about disability.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are:  (1) to provide general and special education teachers with classroom management skills which promote full participation by their students; (2) to provide teachers of students with disabilities strategies for adapting science activities for students with special needs; and (3) to promote collaboration between general and special education teachers within participating districts.\r\n\r\nSST is a pioneering endeavor which will provide a model for districts nationwide which will be highly reproducible.  It will help to ensure that all teachers have the confidence and competence to teach science to students with disabilities, and will help all students to focus on each other's abilities rather than disabilities.\r\n",
