 "awd_abstract_narration": "9802616  Morava       In previous work, the author showed that Witten's tau-function  for topological gravity in two dimensions has a homotopy-theoretic  interpretation as a kind of topological field theory taking values  in a category of modules over a ring-spectrum.  This ring-spectrum  is a large-genus completion of the moduli space of stable algebraic  curves; it is constructed by homotopy-theoretic methods from spaces  of configurations of smooth points on such curves.  Its cohomology  has many features reminiscent of a vertex operator algebra, which is  in turn connected to the theory of symmetric functions.  The methods  of cobordism theory have not been systematically applied to the study  of configuration spaces, but questions in a variety of areas suggest  that this merits investigation.  It is particularly important to extend  the results mentioned above to topological gravity coupled to a  sigma-model, to encompass quantum cohomology along the lines suggested  by T. Eguchi and his school.        The interest of physicists in two-dimensional gravity has shed  more light on the topology of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces than  all previous research in this very classical subject combined, but their  work answers questions that are not, at first sight, what a  mathematician might want to ask, and it has been difficult to understand  these new results in terms of the traditional mathematical approach to  this subject.  It is becoming increasingly clear that configuration  spaces and cobordism techniques are at the geometric heart of the  physicists' constructions, and that their intersection lies in a rich  part of algebraic topology that has till now escaped systematic study.  In physics, it is always taken to be an encouraging sign when  `experimental' applications suggest new `theoretical' questions for  investigation; this is what seems to be happening here in mathematics.      ***",
