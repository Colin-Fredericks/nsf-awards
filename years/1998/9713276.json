 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project, supported by the Analytical and Surface  Chemistry Program, is concerned with the dynamics of halogen  interactions with silicon surfaces.  Using molecular beam  scattering methods, Professor Ceyer and her colleagues at MIT  will test the hypothesis that the high reactivity of XeF2 (as  compared with F atoms) with silicon is due to the large energy  transfer that occurs upon collision of the XeF2 molecule with the  silicon lattice.  This is counter to what would be expected  thermodynamically.  Using a range of fluorine`carriers` with  differing masses, this hypothesis will be directly tested.  In  addition, the detailed dynamics of abstractive chemisorption will  be probed by monitoring emission from electronically excited XeF*  species which may result from the interactions of XeF2 with the  silicon surface.  The etching of silicon by fluorine containing species forms a  part of silicon etching technology, with applications in the  production of electronic devices.  This research project  addresses fundamental questions about the dynamics of surfaces.   Using a range of molecular beam and surface sensitive  spectroscopic methods, the effect of collisional excitation of  the silicon lattice on the reaction dynamics will be probed.  The  dynamics of abstractive dissociative chemisorption of fluorine  containing molecules will also be investigated.",
