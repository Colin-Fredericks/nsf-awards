 "awd_abstract_narration": "Description: This award is for support of a collaborative research project between Dr. S.K. Kawatra, Department of Metallurgical and Materials Engineering at Michigan Technological University in Houghton, and Dr. Adel A. Nofal, Chairman of the Central Metallurgical Research and Development Institute in Cairo, Egypt.  The purpose of the research is to address pollution from coal combustors by identifying means for direct utilization of the high-carbon fly-ashes that are produced by Low-NOx coal combustors.   Specifically this is to address the use of these ashes, which have a higher carbon content than 6% by weight. The objectives of this study are to better understand the behavior of fly-ash in binder applications, and to use this information to determine methods for controlling the kinetics of the binding reaction, and to optimize the fly-ash binder characteristics for particular applications.          Scope:  This project will support collaboration between two teams with complementary capabilities and institutional facilities.  The US team is currently studying the use of high-carbon fly-ashes as binders for organic particulates, such as foundry sands.  The Egyptian team will provide needed capabilities in the study of the interactions of molten metals with fly-ash.  The project fits well within the objectives of the Division of International Programs.",
