 "awd_abstract_narration": "9753542\r\nThe Texas Collaborative for Excellence in Teacher Preparation (TCETP) is a 10 university partnership committed to joint development and common implementation of comprehensive improvements in the preparation of K-12 teachers in mathematics, science, and technology. Fifteen Collaborative Fawlty from the departments of mathematics, science, and education at eight universities in The Texas A&M University System and from Texas Woman's University and Angelo State University are leading this effort. This 10 university partnership prepares over 25% of Texas teachers Keg and 25% of the mathematics and science teachers certified annually in Texas, typically over 3,700 Texas CETP teachers certified each year. Importantly, this CETP is well positioned through its partnership with the NSF Texas Statewide Systemic Initiative (TSSI), 47 of Texas' Presidential Awardees (TPA) for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Teaching (NSF), and major industry committed to preservice and novice teacher internships to implement common systemic improvements and disseminate them in Texas and nationally. The five project goals of the Collaborative Faculty are Core Course and Curriculum Redesign, Recruitment to Teaching, University Faculty Professional Development and Instructional Modeling, Industry Internships for Preservice and Novice Teachers, and Partnership with the Texas SSI and Texas Presidential Awardees. Leadership of the effort comes from principal investigator Dr. Mauro Castro, Chair of Chemistry, and co-principal investigator Dr. Francisco Hidalgo, Dean of Education, Texas A&M University--Kingsville, the lead CETP institution with 65% Hispanic enrollment. The CETP includes 3 Hispanic serving universities, 1 historically Black university, 4 rural serving universities, 1 research university, and 1 comprehensive women's university. The Texas CETP will fundamentally restructures the core mathematics and science education experience of preservice teachers at 10 universities serving every geographic region of the state. The Texas CETP has committed $1 million in matching funds to the project and $156,250 additional funding for Collaborative Faculty interactions.\r\n\r\n",
