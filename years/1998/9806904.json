Professor Alexander Ramm of Kansas  State University and Professor A. Strauss of the University  of Ulyanovsk, Russia are the co-chairs of the Program  Committee, and with Professor P. N. Shivakumar, Director of  the Canadian Institute of Industrial Mathematical Sciences  (IIMS) and chair of the local organizing committee, are the  principal organizers of the conference.  The activity will  bring together leading experts to cover a broad range of  topics in operator theory and its applications to scientific  and industrial problems, financial mathematics and  biomathematics.    The conference is the second in a quadrennial series of  international meetings dedicated to operator theory and its  applications.  While the designated speakers are  international authorities on diverse areas of mathematics  and reflect the broad impact of operator theory, the  conference organizers plan to invite graduate students and  young researchers to enhance the educational value of the  meeting.  Because of the high quality and international  diversity of the participants, support for this conference  is being jointly shared with the Eastern Europe Program of  the Division of International Programs and with the Division  of Mathematical Sciences.  An expected outcome of this  workshop will be a report on the current status and future  directions for the field of operator theory.  ***",
