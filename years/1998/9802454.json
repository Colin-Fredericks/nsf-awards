 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9802454  Nasar      The overall purpose of the proposed research is to develop methods of analysis and design of the flux reversal machine(FRM).  The FRM offers a potential for superior performance compared to existing permanent-magnet reluctance synchronous machines.  It has a simple and robust construction, relatively high power density, high efficiency, and is especially suited for high-speed applications.  Table I in the text of the proposal compares the FRM with other contenders.  Relative advantages of the FRM are also listed in the proposal.    Because the FRM is a recent invention, literature on the subject is virtually nonexistent.  The proposed research is targeted toward a definitive fundamental study of three-phase FRMs operating as generators and motors.  The approach to this research, however, is expected to be applicable to other types of permanent-magnet reluctance synchronous machines.  In general terms, the principal objective of the proposed research is to formulate the principles of analysis and design of the FRM.  This goal is expected to be achieved in the following steps: (i) Perform an in-depth finite element analysis(FEA) of fields and torque for various stator and rotor pole combinations(using a standard software). (ii) Derive expressions for the machine parameters and induced EMFS, including the effects of saturation. (iii) Digitally simulate the machine characteristics under steady-state and transient conditions. (iv) Obtain mathematical models for loss mechanisms. (v) Formulate design equations for the machine. (vi) Optimize the design for minimum mass and maximum efficiency constraints. (vii) Build and test a prototype. (viii) Design a control scheme for an optimal operation of the machine.    The proposed research will lead to the basic principles of analysis and techniques of design of the FRM, and thereby assess its potential for various applications.  These principles and techniques are expected to be applicable to other types of permanent magnet reluctance  machines, and herein lies the intrinsic merit of the proposed research.  Finally, at least two graduate students are expected to earn their MS/PhD while working on the project.    In terms of theoretical development, a thorough FEA of the fields and forces in the machine will be conducted.  FEA is expected to yield the machine parameters and aid in the evaluation of losses in the core and magnets.  Having determined the machine parameters, a digital simulation model will be developed and used to determine the machine steady-state and transient characteristics.  The design will proceed. initially, along classical lines in that design formulas will be derived and used to design a prototype.  Ultimately, the design will be optimized for minimum mass and maximum efficiency conditions(using a standard procedure such as the Hooke-Jeeves method).  Finally, a prototype will be built and tested(primarily with the help Of Stirling Technology Company).",
