 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global  Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program  (GLOBE) this project is designed to meet GLOBE goals and  objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren in a  global information network with the ultimate goal of better  understanding Earth's environment and changes that take  place within it.  This proposal consists of various segments  addressing GLOBE Program needs: support for existing  protocols, development of new protocols, and scientific  research with GLOBE data.  This proposal will support the  current set of GLOBE land cover/biology protocols.  This project will modify existing protocols, develop and  test new ones, and review GLOBE data submitted to the  archive.  The project will support the overall training and  outreach activities of the program, fostering student  scientist partnerships.  The scientific issue addressed by  this proposal is the need to integrate reference data  collection and accuracy assessment (i.e. validation) into  land cover data sets generated from remotely sensed data.  Other GLOBE protocols provide data that are currently  collected by other sources around the world (e.g.  temperature, precipitation), however, no other source of  regional, continental, much less global validation data is  currently being collected anywhere except by GLOBE students.  This land cover/biology investigation has the double benefit  of allowing student to experience the process of science  while providing for a unique and valuable validation data  set for use by the remote sensing community.  This project  is collaborating with NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging  Spectroradiometer (MODIS) team to provide the calibration  and validation data for this new NASA Earth Observing System  sensor in order to generate regional land cover maps  worldwide.  Students will work primarily with Landsat data,  as well as learning how to use geographic information  systems (GIS) to answer scientific questions about land  cover mapping.  %%%  In response to an Announcement of Opportunity for the Global  Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment Program  (GLOBE) this project is designed to meet GLOBE goals and  objectives of linking scientists and schoolchildren in a  global information network with the ultimate goal of better  understanding Earth's environment and changes that take  place within it.
