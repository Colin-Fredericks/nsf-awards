 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  9761006  Carrig    This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project uses advanced solid-state laser technology and lidar engineering for a compact, turn-key, eyesafe differential absorption lidar (DIAL), suitable for range-resolved atmospheric profiling of ozone to distances of up to three kilometers.  Such systems are needed in municipalities in ozone nonattainment status in order to target actual pollution sources.  The new DIAL system is based on a frequency-agile ultraviolet (UV) laser transmitter that is substantially smaller and more efficient than existing UV laser sources.  This will permit mobile remote sensors that are lighter, more compact, and potentially less expensive than current UV DIALS.  Further, Phase I will incorporate lidar transceiver technology effective in flight-qualified wind-sensing systems.  This includes a real-time signal processor with an easy-to-use graphical user interface. In Phase I a complete turn-key system design will be completed.  In Phase II a prototype device would be built.  The applicability of this lidar for atmospheric measurements of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter will also be investigated.  The primary market is local and regional municipalities declared to be in ozone nonattainment status.  The sensor can be modified for profiling of sulfur dioxide.  The instrument will also be scaleable for long-range tropospheric and stratospheric ozone measurements.  ***",
