Bohs    The tomato family (Solanaceae) is one of world's most economically important plant groups, and many of these species have been introduced throughout the world from the Americas.  Familiar members of the family include the tomato, potato, and eggplant, as well as other minor food crops and tobacco.   Certain species are sources of foods, ornamental plants, and medicinally valuable or poisonous alkaloids.  Solanum, one of the largest genera of any plant family, has about 1500 species throughout the world, but species are most numerous in the New World tropics.  Solanum exhibits a remarkable diversity in morphology, biochemistry, reproductive systems, and dispersal patterns that make it ideal group for evolutionary studies.  Because the understanding of the classification and evolution of Solanum is very limited, the ability of agriculturists and scientists to utilize species of economic and scientific interest is hindered.  Dr. Bohs will use two molecular data sets, one from the chloroplast genome and one from the nuclear ribosomal DNA, to examine evolutionary relationships across the taxonomic spectrum of the entire genus.  This study will arrive at a classification framework that can be used to guide more detailed studies at lower taxonomic levels. Questions concerning biogeographic patterns, breeding system evolution, and fruit morphology and dispersal will be examined in a phylogenetic context.  A field trip to Bolivia is planned to collect unusual and poorly known representatives of Solanum that will enhance our knowledge of morphological evolution and species diversity in this large and important genus.",
