 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lauder  9807012         The study of how animals move and generate force against the  environment has been a topic of interest to biologists for hundreds of  years. One key reason for this interest is that it is very difficult to  understand how muscles and bones function to cause movement unless one is  able to measure the effect of muscle contraction. This appears as force  exerted on the environment. However, despite the importance of the ability  to measure forces, analysis of the effect of muscle contraction has  remained inferential for many moving organisms because of our inability to  directly measure force when animals move in air or water. On land, animals  exert force on the ground and these forces can be measured directly. But  such direct measurements are not possible in fluids, and biologists have  lacked a means of making such measurements.       This proposal will apply the results of a technique developed  recently by engineers called Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (DPIV)  which allows direct quantification of flow in moving fluids and the  calculation of the force exerted on the fluid by organisms. This technique  will be applied to a classical problem in vertebrate biology: the function  and evolution of fins in fishes. Because of the prominence of median fins  in early vertebrate fossils, their importance in locomotion, and the  diversity of median fin shapes in fishes, the evolution of fins has been  discussed in virtually every textbook of comparative anatomy, paleontology,  and functional morphology.       This study will use DPIV to visualize directly water velocity over  fins of fishes and to calculate the forces that result from movement. The  PI will use DPIV in conjunction with analysis of three-dimensional fin  movements and recordings of the electrical activity generated by fin  muscles to test hypotheses about how fishes generate force on the water.  Preliminary data for this study are presented which demonstrate feasibility  of applying this technique and init ial results show the character of the  data that would result from this research.       This proposal will introduce a powerful new technique for the  experimental study of aquatic locomotion, and by directly quantifying for  the first time flow around and behind fins, this study will provide novel  data on mechanisms of aquatic propulsion and contribute to clarifying a  classic issue in vertebrate functional morphology.",
