 "awd_abstract_narration": "The floral homeotic gene AGAMOUS (AG) is required for specifying reproductive organ identify and for controlling a determinate floral meristem.  According to the ABC model for floral organ identify, AG is the only known gene required for the C function.  Previous work in this laboratory has contributed to the demonstration that AG is also sufficient within the flower to confer C function.  More recent results from this lab have shown that AG is an important regulator of floral meristem identity in that it controls the meristem under conditions not favorable for flowering.  In this proposal, Dr. Ma will focus on the further characterization of AG function using genetic and molecular approaches.  He will characterize the phenotypes of two recently discovered weak ag mutants.  Analysis of these mutants will shed new light on AG function.  He will test for possible interaction between AG genes mediating control of flowering by light.  This may reveal how AG function my be regulated by light signals.  He will identify new genes that participate in AG function by isolating enhancer and suppressor mutations.  These new mutations should provide new entry points to a better understanding of AG function.  In addition, new constructs that provide inducible AG function will be made to analyze the effective temporal and spatial ranges of AG action, and to prepare for further studies of AG functions, such as the identification of target genes.  These studies will likely produce new insights about AG functions, and about MADS box genes in general.  In addition, the genetic resources that will be generated during these studies will be valuable tools to others in the community.",
