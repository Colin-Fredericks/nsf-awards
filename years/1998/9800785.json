 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800785  This proposal concerns links between programming language theory  and semantics and probabilistic computation, with applications to  security analysis. The proposed work is to develop an analysis of  cryptographic protocols based on programming languages, but using  the probabilistic techniques of cryptography. This is a departure  from most formal analyses  of cryptographic protocols, which treat cryptographic operations  as \"black boxes\". The proposed work will include the development  of a modal-typed, concurrent programming language for defining  communicating systems of probabilistic polynomial-time processes.  A novel property of the proposed language is the use of  probabilistic rather than nondeterministic scheduling  of processes. A related notion of observational equivalence for  sets of probabilistic processes will play a central role in  reasoning about this language and in its applications to security  analysis. The proposed research will develop methods for  reasoning about observational equivalence (or some  approximation to observational equivalence such as probabilistic  trace equivalence or bisimulation) and use these methods to  establish security properties of various protocols. The proposed  framework will provide a useful analysis tool for working  backwards from security properties of a protocol to derive  necessary properties of underlying encryption primitives.***",
