 "awd_abstract_narration": "9800537  Slaughter  This research will develop design approaches for facilities  which explicitly acknowledge and take into account changing  requirements over the long term (e.g., 100 years).  Specifically, the research will characterize interactions  within and among systems that influence the capacity of  built facilities to change over the long-term, which can be  called \"facility flexibility.\"  Using the framework of  interactions among systems, and defined types of changes,  the research will explore the impacts of new design or  technology innovations on the facility flexibility.  Innovations may be in systems and their components or in  construction processes, and can potentially decrease costs  and time associated with effectively responding to changes.    The research will be empirically based, using data from  actual facilities and projects, and will use advanced  computer analysis and simulation tools to organize the  interaction framework and evaluate scenarios.  The data on  buildings will be collected from the owners, facilities  managers, architects, engineers, and contractors as  applicable.  The data will be used to construct and inform  the building systems and interactions framework.  This  framework will then be used to identify the nature of the  system's capacity to respond to changes, specifically in  function, capacity, and flow, over the long term.  These scenario-testing models will provide a means through  which to estimate the relative costs/benefits, time,  performance, and worker safety associated with accommodating  the changes.  The scenario models can then be used to  estimate the degree and nature of the impacts of design and  technology innovations.    The results from this research will be a systematic  methodology and a set of tools (the building system and  interaction framework and scenario models) to assess the  capacity of a built facility to respond to changes over the  long term.  ****",
