 "awd_abstract_narration": "***  Krishnan             This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is aimed at the development of a real-time spectroscopic ellipsometer system for thin-film process control. The key technical challenge to realizing time-resolved ellipsometry is the development of a polarization measurement sensor that operates over a wide spectral range with high spectral resolution and no moving parts. This sensor, the Grating Division-of-Amplitude Photopolarimeter (G-DOAP) uses a diffraction grating to spectrally and polarimetrically disperse light into several orders which are detected simultaneously by linear array detectors. In the Phase I research, we demonstrated, for the first time, that it was feasible to operate the G-DOAP in the 400-1000 nm wavelength range. The Phase I research also identified design ideas relating to the geometric, spectral and polarimetric optical designs including the use of vertically-multiplexed arrays, order blocking filters, use of the zero order beam for alignment, minimization of polarizer sheets and high speed electronics. The Phase II program is aimed at: (i) complete mechanical, optical, electronics, and polarimetric design of a G-DOAP system, (ii) assemble, test and characterize the G-DOAP system, and (iii) apply the Phase II G-DOAP for characterizing coatings and materials in both in-situ and ex-situ applications. If successful, rapid commercialization of the G-DOAP will be achieved through collaborative and licensing arrangements with our commercial partners from whom we have a Phase III follow-on funding commitments.    The proposed G-DOAP based SE would be a low-cost, high speed system for real-time control of thin film deposition in the semiconductor industry in CVD, MOCVD, MBE, and PVD processes. Applications for the G-DOAP sensor also         exist in pharmaceutical, astronomy and research markets.  ***",
