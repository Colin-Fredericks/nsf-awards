 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although consonant weakening or lenition is a common phenomenon, no  comprehensive explanation exists. If weakening is a decrease in the  duration and magnitude of consonant production, as it has recently  been described, quantifying these changes should clarify the  phenomenon. Duration is easily measured with acoustic analysis, but  other methods must be employed for magnitude. This study will use  dynamic electropalatography (EPG) to gather data on the magnitude  of linguopalatal contact over time. Stress, position-in-word, and  speech rate will be manipulated to determine their effects on the  production of consonants in American English and Spanish languages  with different types and degrees of phonologized weakening.  Differences between phonetic and phonologized weakening will be  assessed and a contact-based metric to differentiate them will be  provided. The possibility that duration and magnitude varying  separately~an account for the range of weakenings for a single  segment (e.g.  k  weakening to either  g  or  x ) will be explored.  This study will provide new insight into the nature of connected  speech processes, add to existing knowledge about speech rate  variations, and demonstrate the importance of prosodic structure to  consonant articulation. Methodologically, it will advance  techniques in applying EPG data to our understanding of acoustic  and phonological patterns.",
