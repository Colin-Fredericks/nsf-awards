Recent  results, beginning with the work of Rips and Sela, have shown that the  toral decomposition of 3-manifolds due to Jaco-Shalen and Johannson can  be generalized to the much broader setting of finitely presented groups  (this is called the JSJ decomposition).  This generalization points  towards a hierarchy for groups that terminates with indecomposable groups.  For example, one would begin with a finitely presented group, split it as  an amalgam over a trivial or infinite cyclic group, and then proceed  iteratively on the vertex groups.  One would then want to know if such a  process terminates with groups that are indecomposable as amalgams over  a trivial or cyclic group.  One also wants to know if a quasi-isometry  between groups preserves the JSJ-decomposition.  This quasi-isometric  invariance holds in the hyperbolic setting by deep work of Bowditch, but  it remains a mystery in general.       A 3-manifold is a space that looks locally like the space in which  we live; for instance, one can take a cube and glue opposite faces together  in pairs.  There is a very rich and beautiful decomposition theory for  3-manifolds that tells us that a 3-manifold can be cut up into simpler  pieces.  Recently, some very surprising work has shown that a good part of  this decomposition theory generalizes to a far broader setting, namely to  groups, groups being the mathematically precise way to describe symmetry.  However, the picture of group decompositions is far from complete.  The aim  of this project is to investigate the extent to which groups can be  decomposed into simpler pieces.  ***",
