 "awd_abstract_narration": "9732279    The American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) is an  inspirational place for young scientists to work, and its  REU program offers an unrivaled opportunity to expose  students to the challenge of original research in fields of  biology that they rarely have the opportunity to fully  explore at their home institutions.  The AMNH program draws  in the research and mentoring expertise of the AMNH's  outstanding scientific staff, and provides students with a  coherent, hands-on introduction to research in the broad  areas of systematics and evolutionary biology.  In entering  into the Museum community, students are offered an  extraordinary opportunity to broaden their experience of  biological disciplines and participate in the highest  caliber research at a premier research institution.    AMNH offers comprehensive, interactive educational  experience that centers around projects carefully designed  to introduce undergraduates to the excitement, challenge,  and relevance of systematics and contemporary evolutionary  biology.  In addition to the core component of hands-on  research, students participate in round-table discussions  where they discuss their research progress and problems,  \"show and tell\" their latest findings, and thrash-out ideas  in an informal and supportive setting.  A Species Lecture  Series introduces students to eminent museum faculty whose  lectures address current debates in systematics and  evolutionary theory.  At the end of each summer program,  students participate in a Student Seminar where they  give formal slide-illustrated presentations to a supportive,  yet critical, audience of mentors and peers.  On leaving the  AMNH, students are tracked and, in many cases, supported  through their remaining undergraduate, graduate, and even  postdoctoral careers.",
