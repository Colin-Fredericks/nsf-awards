 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803411\r\nSussmann\r\n\r\nResearch will be carried out on nonlinear control theory, continuing the \r\nprincipal investigator's previous work in this area on a broad class of \r\ntheoretical and applied control theory problems.  The methods used will be \r\nthose of differential-geometric control theory, nonsmooth analysis, and the \r\ntheory of real analytic maps and their associated stratifications.  \r\nSpecifically, efforts will be made to solve a number of open problems in \r\nthe areas of optimal control, controllability, and realization theory, while \r\npursuing the development of the necessary mathematical tools.  In \r\nparticular, work will continue on a major project that began in 1992, and \r\nhas evolved since then and has led to a strong, general, unified version of \r\nthe necessary conditions for optimality usually known as the ``Pontryagin \r\nMaximum Principle.'' This new version of the Maximum Principle \r\nrequires the use of a new theory of generalized differentials, called \r\n``multidifferentials,'' and part of the work will involve the systematic \r\ndevelopment of this theory and its applications.\r\n\r\nRecent developments in nonlinear control have led to many applications to \r\nvarious issues in robotics and nonholonomic motion planning.  The \r\ngeneral question here is that of finding a path for a given system that takes \r\nit from a given state to another desired state, satisfying some constraints or \r\noptimizing some cost functional. (For example, steer a vehicle from a \r\ngiven position to another desired position while avoiding certain obstacles, \r\npossibly with the extra requirement that this be done in minimum time or \r\nwith minimum expenditure of energy.)  Thanks to the extraordinary recent \r\nadvances in computing power, it has now become realistic to expect to \r\nsolve many of these problems in real time, and we intend to develop \r\nmethods that will contribute to this endeavor, by providing an a priori \r\nunderstanding of the structure of the solutions, so as to reduce the search \r\nneeded to find it.  A special effort will be made to improve communication \r\nbetween specialists in the field of nonlinear control and the general \r\nmathematical and engineering community, by bringing to the attention of \r\nthe community examples of applications that show the advantages and the \r\npower of the techniques of nonlinear control.\r\n",
