The research has a two-fold thrust: (1) to exploit the  theoretical framework established during the last grant  period both in terms of explanation of the complex array of  experimental data available and in terms of broadening,  deepening and making more detailed the theoretical basis for  this framework. (2) Using the cuprates as a paradigm, to  look for comparable breakdowns of conventional theory in  other systems including organic superconductors, spin ladder  compounds and mixed-valence electron systems.  %%%  This is a renewal grant to support theoretical research on  high-temperature superconductivity and related phenomena.
