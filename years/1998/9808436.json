 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   (CRIF) Program will assist the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry   at Texas Tech University to purchase a 400 MHz liquid phase nuclear   magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer.   This equipment will enhance   research in a number of areas such as the following: (1) covalent   modification of antigenic peptides by the quinonoid sponge metabolite   puupehenone, (2) synthesis and solid solution phase structures of   biologically active substance P analogs, (3) synthetic organic hosts for   the recognition of ionic guests, (4) catalysts for asymmetric reactions   and (5) the synthesis of taxol derivatives.  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance   (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool available to chemists for   the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify   unknown substances, characterize specific arrangements of atoms within   molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in   solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometry is essential to   chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these   NMR studies are useful in the areas such as polymers, catalysis, and in   biology.",
