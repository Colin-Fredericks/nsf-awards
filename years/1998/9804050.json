 "awd_abstract_narration": "The auditory systems of humans and animals represent and  process time-varying signals and make inferences on them.  The acoustic energy from various sound sources impinges on  our ears from different directions and the inner ears and  the brain, together, seem to effortlessly separate them into  independent recognizable streams. What kind of signal  processing underlies this phenomenon? Is it possible to  emulate this kind of processing in a computer and thereby  improve machine-based speech recognition systems? This  project constitutes a collaborative effort between auditory  scientists and signal processing engineers to advance the  state of the art in non-stationary signal analysis.  Many of the existing non-stationary signal analysis methods  such as time-frequency analyses are computationally complex  and are not amenable to automatic feature extraction. On the  other hand, various model-based signal analysis methods  require detailed knowledge of the underlying signal  generation mechanisms which is often not available. Taking  cues from the initial stages of auditory processing, the  investigators are developing an approach and associated  signal processing algorithms for analyzing composite  signals. Their approach to signal analysis is based on  viewing signals as products of `elementary signals' rather  than sums of sinusoidal signals as in traditional Fourier  analysis. This view of signals is closely related to the  theory of analytic functions. Thus, composite signals will  be decomposed into component analytic signals which can be  further decomposed into component analytic signals and so  on. These signals are amenable to logarithmic processing and  lead to a natural way of characterizing a time-varying  signal interms of its positive instantaneous frequencies and  log-envelopes. Overall the proposed approach is a non  parametric way to characterize modulation properties of  signals. This is to be contrasted with the traditional  Fourier based methods where the emphasis is on po wer  spectral analysis.",
