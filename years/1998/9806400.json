 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Proposal has developed out of a previous balloon flight supported by NSF during which MeV X-rays were observed within the auroral zone in the afternoon sector.  These observations were unexpected, though there have been few measurements taken in this local time and latitude sector which would reveal these phenomena.  The present proposal results from decision by the NASA National Scientific Balloon Facility to again launch an arctic long duration balloon in the summer of 1998.  It will be possible to refly the X-ray instruments on this flight.  This will enable several weeks of continuous observations, motivated largely to search for additional MeV X-ray bursts in order to understand the significance and nature of these phenomena.  The balloon observations will be made in conjunction with spacecraft observations, particularly the POLAR satellite which includes polar imaging instruments as well as plasma, wave, and field instruments.  This proposal is primarily aimed as hardware refurbishment to enable the flight.  A subsequent proposal will be submitted for analysis of the data.  This proposal is being considered by both NASA and NSF and both agencies are undertaking the normal review process.  Because, however, of the time critical needs for preparing flight instruments and integration into the balloon package, we have contacted reviewers to request an expedited  review.",
