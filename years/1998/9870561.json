 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870561 Marr The objective of this research is to establish a foundation for the verification of in situ bioremediation. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that the molecular biology tools of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) can be used to monitor the succession of microbial populations associated with in situ biodegradation of chlorinated solvents. PCR and DGGE have been successfully applied to natural microbial communities to elucidate microbial diversity and identify the specific populations present in uncontaminated aquatic, sediment and soil environments. Specific objectives are to 1) optimize the application of PCR and DGGE to distinguish microbial species in uncontaminated methanotrophic soil, 2) simultaneously monitor trichloroethylene degradation and species diversity as measured by DGGE resolution of PCR-amplified 16S rDNA and 3) identify the predominant species over time via type-specific phylogenetic and catabolic gene probes and by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. The ultimate impact of this research will be to enhance our knowledge of bioremediation and to provide tools to monitor and optimize operating conditions during in situ bioremediation of contaminated groundwater sites. This project will allow the PI to take a leadership position among researchers in the area of disinfection processes by focusing her research in an area were there are significant knowledge gaps",
