Hosted by   the Pacific Software Research Center (PacSoft) at the Oregon Graduate   Institute of Science and Technology, the workshop will be held on May   29-31, 1998 with emphasis on seeking out applications and making ``tools''   of categories more accessible to computer scientists.    The workshop begins with a day of tutorials aimed at students, educators   and newcomers to category theory, followed by a day and a half of research   talks.  In bringing together leaders in the field of category theory with   leaders in the field of computer science, the workshop offers the   possibility of disseminating advanced techniques at a much deeper level of   understanding than could be achieved through the literature alone.",
