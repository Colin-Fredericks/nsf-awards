 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a focus of this research, conformationally constrained glycopeptides   will be used as probes of the recognition of glycoproteins by the   glycotransferases that construct core structures of O-linked   oligosaccharides. The tranferase chosen for detailed study is that   responsible for biosynthesizing  Core 1 disaccharide (Core 1 GalTase).    Core 1 GalTase is known to selectivity glycosylate GalNAc motifs in   particular protein backbone sequences and secondary structures. Compounds   which correspond to conformationally locked, low energy rotamers around   the torsional  angle x2 of the parent GalNAc, will be synthesized and   incorporated into peptides.  These glycopeptides will then be evaluated   as substrates or inhibitors of Core 1 GalTase.  The findings will be used   to elucidate the three dimensional array of peptide and carbohydrate   determinants in the substrate that constitute the binding epitome for   Core 1 GalTase and to develop a model for how this equates with   information transfer from protein to carbohydrate domains.  The primary   focus of the educational will be the development of a bachelors/masters   degree program with offerings in synthetic chemistry, analytical   chemistry, environmental chemistry and biotechnology.  With this Faculty   Early Development (CAREER) award, the Organic and Macromolecular   Chemistry Program is supporting the research and educational activities   of Dr. Randall L. Halcomb of the Department of Chemistry at the   University of Colorado, Boulder.   Professor Halcomb will focus his   research efforts on combining the tools of organic chemistry with   biochemistry and structural biology to design and synthesize   conformationally constrained glycopeptides as probes of the recognition   of glycoproteins by the glycotransferases that construct core structures   of O-linked oligosaccharides.  Glycoylation is a ubiquitous modification   of proteins and is associated with a number of processes within the cell   and at the cell surface, such as protein transport, cell adhesion and   signal transduction.  The education plan will center on the development   of a bachelors/masters degree program in chemistry.",
