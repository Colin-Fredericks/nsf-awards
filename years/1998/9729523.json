 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of the proposed research is to develop a  prototype of a sensor device based on immuno-interactions or  rapid, automated, quantitative determination of viral  infections in small mammals.  As a result of this  development several functioning immunoassay devices will be  tested in environmental biology field studies of Hantavirus  (Sin Nombre Virus) infection in mice populations in the  wild.  The work initially will be focused on the  optimization of an immunosensor for fast (10-20) min.  determination of virus and will be extended towards the  development of an semi-automated portable immunoassay system  to be used in field stations or other remote sites.    The proposed immunosensor utilizes highly dispersed carbon  material.  The conductivity of carbon materials permits its  use as electrode materials for electrochemical detection and  at the same time as carrier for the immuno-chemicals.  The  immunosensors proposed will be developed using disposable  flow electrodes and offer a means to conduct fast ELISA  (Enzyme Labeled Immunosorbent Assay) with an electrochemical  detection.  The proposed research will result in prototype  portable immunoassay system consisting of miniaturized,  automated and electronically controlled and self-contained  hand-held devices to be used in environmental biology  studies.    A combination of descriptive and analytic studies of  environmental characteristics associated with rodent  Hantavirus prevalence will be used as the initial test of  the immunoassay system.  These analyses require fast and  reliable instrumentation suitable for operation in field  conditions or in a remote setting.  The immunosensors can  also be used for rapid analyses in conventional conditions  of biological, physiological and analytical practices.",
