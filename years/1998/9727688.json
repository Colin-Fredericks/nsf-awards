 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Drs. Lynne Schepartz and Sari Miller-Antonio and an international team of collaborators will conduct one season of archaeological excavation at the site of Panxian Dadong, located in Guizhou Province, Southern China. This large cavern is the middle in a series of three stacked within a 230 meter high hill. Its eastward facing entrance is 55 meters wide and 50 meters high  and the main chamber averages 35 meters wide by 220 meters in length. Preliminary work by a joint Chinese US team of scientists has revealed stratified archaeological deposits which contain both well preserved faunal remains and stone tools. One fragmentary hominid tooth has also been recovered. A large series of samples collected for Uranium series dating suggests that the uppermost 2-3 meters of the deposits formed between 200,000 and 130,000 years ago and that on this basis it is likely that the bulk of the deposits may be older that 250,000 years.   Very little is known about the Upper and Middle Paleolithic periods in Northern China and the investigators wish to conduct a long term multi-season excavation to reconstruct the geological, archaeological and environmental sequence and to place these into an absolute chronological context. During the 1998 field season they will expand the depth of the current excavation and also open additional trench units. This will serve to maximize the area of exposed deposits. They will replace dosimeters which measure soil radiation and collect samples for a suite of dating techniques. Several travertine layers have been located but their stratigraphic context is not clear and geologists will work to resolve this issue. Lithics and faunal remains will be collected and analyzed.  While China has yielded important hominid fossils and numerous archaeological assemblages, most are poorly dated. Because of this it is difficult to determine the role this vast area played in the broad sweep of human cultural and biological development and it is unclear whether the current focus on Africa as a crucial area results merely from the fact that much more archaeological work has been conducted there. This project should help to remedy this situation. It will provide an important counterbalance, yield data of interest to many archaeologists, and establish a regional framework within which other sites may be encompassed. It will further the careers of two promising young archaeologists and enhance scientific collaboration between China and the US",
