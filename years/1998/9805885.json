 "awd_abstract_narration": "The physical layer of the network protocol stack refers to the  signals transmitted, and received, over a physical medium, such  as a wire (e.g. a twisted pair of wires or a coaxial cable), an  electromagnetic wave (e.g. a satellite transponder, a  cellular/PCS tower or a wireless local area network (WLAN) base  station), or a recording medium (e.g. magnetic or optical disks).  The research has a broad perspective, from the viewpoint of the  physical medium, and a narrow focus in that the problems  addressed all involve a form of forward error control (FEC).  The  research is directed in three areas:         Mathematical methods and analysis algorithms for coding       Problems in algebraic coding       Turbo code error control    In the first topic area, the following are considered:  theory  and practice of interleaving, a novel method for computing the  weight distribution of a binary convolutional code, and problems  concerning the capacity of wireless channels with and without  side information on channel state.  The second topic area  concerns basic understanding and advances in the area of  algebraic geometry (AG) coding.  These AG codes show potential  for application in transmission systems.  Further understanding  needs to be developed to enable the practical implementation of  AG codes.  In the final topic, new applications of \"turbo coding\"  are identified, including systems with memory and turbo coded  modulation.",
