 "awd_abstract_narration": "A distinct need in modern chemistry curricula is to integrate the learning of chemical concepts with the use of modern instrumentation. The instruments can be used to teach chemical concepts and, at the same time, learning the chemical concepts makes the instruments more than magical black (or beige) boxes. A specific need in teaching organic chemistry is to have an effective laboratory approach to communicate the concepts of chemical structure, especially the concepts of constitutional isomerism and stereoisomerism. In analytical chemistry, more emphasis needs to be placed on how analyses of biologically relevant samples are carried out, and, for chemistry and honors students from other majors, how experimental protocols are developed. The objective of the present project is to teach concepts of molecular structure and methods of analysis by application of modern gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) instrumentation in microscale experiments using a \"spiral\" approach. In the spiral approach, the relation between GC/MS experiments and molecular structure is re-visited in several laboratory courses spread out over one or more years. This objective is being accomplished by introducing five new experiments using GC/MS into introductory level organic and analytical chemistry courses. The new organic experiments are innovative approaches to the concepts of empirical and molecular formulas, constitutional isomerism, and stereoisomerism. The analytical experiments are part of a new approach to introduce student-designed protocols for the analysis of biologically relevant chemical samples. The proposed experiments are significant in illustrating chemical concepts that are I ) neglected in existing laboratory manuals, 2) otherwise difficult to illustrate in microscale, or 3) relevant to students more interested in biologically related subjects that are often neglected in traditional chemistry laboratory experiments.",
