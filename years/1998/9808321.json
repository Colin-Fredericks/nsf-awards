 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves the development and improvement  of a new conformational search strategy based on a convex  global underestimator (CGU).  The CGU search strategy has  already been successfully tested on the Sun model for  protein folding.  This project will (1) speed up the CGU  method for fast conformational searches and (2) improve the  potential energy function by parameter estimation.  Several  enhancements will be used to speed up the method, including  (a) using a core-directed chain growth method as a front  end, (b) using the Han and Baker secondary structure rules,  where applicable, to reduce the number of degrees of  freedom, and (c) using Appel's method to reduce the number  of required energy evaluations.       To improve the search method so that it will work with  better energy functions, this project will systematically  move away from the Sun model toward more realistic protein  potential functions and models.  To do this, a new  computational parameter estimation method that can  simultaneously adjust all the energy function parameters  will be developed, so as to reduce the difference between  the global minimum conformation in the model and known  native conformation for all members of a selected set of  proteins.",
