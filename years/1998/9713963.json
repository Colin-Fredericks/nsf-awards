 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Dauphin Island Island Sea Lab (DISL) serves Alabama's  research and instructional needs in the marine sciences.  Students at all educational levels, including K-12  pupils,undergraduate and graduate students, teachers-in-  training, elderhostel participants, and the general public,  benefit from the programs offered at DISL. Although DISL's  academic staff and physical plant have been growing steadily  during the quartercentury of its existence, its educational  and research missions have been hindered by the lack of  adequate Wet Lab facilities for experimentation under  controlled conditions.    DISL has a University Programs staff of ten academic  faculty, all of whom are active researchers and teachers.  The faculty study a variety of basic and applied problems in  oceanography and marine biology, and they provide advice to  industry, government, and the public.  Research areas  include the effects of spatio-temoral scale on  herbivory in seagrass communities, predation on commercially  important fish at the larval stage, flow and mass transfer  of nutrients at scales ranging from the individual organism  to the whole ecosystem, the effects of eutrophication on  water-column dynamics in near-coastal ecosystems, the  chemical oceanography of organosulfur compounds,  paleoceanography and paleobiology, and the ecology of  gelatinous zooplankton.    DISL's current Wet Lab facility was assembled in 1987 and  destroyed by Hurricane Opal in 1955.  It is at present  running at a basic level and being used primarily for  holding specimens and for minimal instructional purposes.  Each member of the University Programs faculty at DISL has  need of a far more sophisticated facility for teaching and  research.  Collaborations between DISL faculty and  researchers at regional, national, and international levels  would be greatly enhanced by an improved Wet Lab.    This vibrant project will support the partial renovation of  the Web Lab, bringing it to a level of operation  commensurate with the growin g marine science institution  that is DISL.  The existing building will be refurbished to  include a plankton and larval fish culture room; indoor  recirculating flumes for experiments on the biomechanics of  flow; and indoor wet tables for holding specimens.  An on-  site computer facility will be used  to monitor the seawater, freshwater, electrical, and  associated control systems; provide data management and  processing capabilities; and make data available to other  researchers through the World Wide Web.",
