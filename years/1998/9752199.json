 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose the conception, development, production, evaluation and dissemination of a series of interactive modules for the teaching and learning of fluid mechanics for undergraduates in science and engineering. The modules focus on fundamentals and will have impact across the curricula of Chemical, Mechanical, Petroleum, Aeronautical, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Oceanography, Meteorology, Geophysics, Applied Mathematics and Applied Physics. The primary objectives are to enhance student learning in the areas of (i) problem solving, (ii) intuition about complex flow phenomena, and (iii) retention of knowledge. These objectives will be met by providing experimental visualizations and computational simulations of fluid flow phenomena in an interactive medium, including student exercises and problems to be solved based on the material in the module.    Three modules will be produced, with emphasis on Basic Concepts I & II, and Boundary Layer Phenomena. The modules will be developed, tested, evaluated and refined over a one year period, resulting in a final CD-ROM version. The final version will be disseminated through a commercial publishing house such as John Wiley and Sons.    The project represents a national effort centered at MIT, Stanford University, and the University of Illinois, and involving researchers and educators drawn from the community at large. The organization consists of a working group of seven investigatorts, including undergraduate teachers of fluid mechanics, writers of successful textbooks, and researchers with specific expertise.  The evaluation will involve both formative and summative components, and be conducted using graduate students from the Stanford School of Education.",
