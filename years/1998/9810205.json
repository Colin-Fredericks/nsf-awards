 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cache-Coherent Non-Uniform Memory Access (CC-NUMA)  architectures are rapidly becoming a standard for scalable  multiprocessor design. The main problem with such  architectures lies in the large remote memory access time.  This project deals with designing novel switch architectures  for the  CC-NUMA machines to alleviate the memory latency problem.  Custom switch designs are being developed based on  dynamically allocated combined buffer and wormhole routing  with virtual channels. The switch arbiter is redesigned to  provide different priorities for different type of messages  as applicable in a shared memory environment. A new switch  cache architecture is being developed which uses the buffers  as a cache inside the switch to support data sharing between  the processors, as a prefetch or  victim buffer, and as distributed directories to maintain  cache coherence. Hardware and software support for processor  and memory management is also being investigated. Study of  the behavior of shared memory applications forms an integral  part of the project. The new designs are incorporated in to  an execution-driven simulator and the performance  improvement of various scientific and commercial  applications is being measured.",
