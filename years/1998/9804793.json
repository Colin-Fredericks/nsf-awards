 "awd_abstract_narration": "In 1993, a group of French researchers announced the invention of  ``turbo-codes,'' a fundamentally new approach to the problem of  attaining near Shannon limit performance on a variety of  communications channel models. Many researchers believe that  turbo codes are the most important new idea in error-correcting  codes since Shannon's original paper. Professor McEliece's work  under this NSF grant is motivated by the desire to provide a  sound theoretical explanation for the experimentally verified  iterative turbo decoding algorithm, which is the key innovation  of the French group.  McEliece's research has led to the  discovery of a close connection between the turbo decoding  algorithm and a number of other algorithms known in the  cryptography, information theory, digital communications, signal  processing, statistics, and artificial intelligence communities.  McEliece and his co-workers have shown that all of these  algorithms can be unified by a single technique which he calls  the generalized distributive law, or GDL. In this work, the goal  is to exploit the GDL to (a) search for a theoretical explanation  of the turbo decoding algorithm, and (b) to devise new decoding  algorithms in non-turbo situations.",
