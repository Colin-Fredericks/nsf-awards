 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a human-computer interaction research consortium of promising doctoral students and distinguished research faculty, to be held in conjunction with the 1999 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 99), sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human Computer Interaction (ACM SIGCHI).  The goals of the Doctoral Consortium include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having the experts in the research field give advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference.  Student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the Consortium, and will receive feedback from the faculty panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction work, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  The student participants will also present their work during the technical program of the CHI 99 conference.  Extended abstracts of the students' work will be disseminated via publication in the CHI 99 Extended Abstracts, which has wide print and electronic dissemination.  Evaluation of the Consortium will be conduced by ACM SIGCHI's conference management committee, and results of the evaluation will be made available to the organizers of future consortia.",
