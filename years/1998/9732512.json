 "awd_abstract_narration": "A daily cycle of rhythmic activity is present in most animals  and plants.  While some of this timing control is from processes  ('biological clocks') within the organism, there also is a  synchronizing of such activity with external stimuli, such as day  length.  The matching of the daily cycle with a periodic external  stimulus, such as sunrise, is called 'entrainment.'  Sometimes  entrainment occurs to stimuli that are non-photic, as well.  This  conference will bring together a group of researchers in this  research area to discuss current and sometimes conflicting  evidence for the mechanisms underlying these entrainment effects,  at levels ranging from the molecular to behavioral.     Because of the widely distributed effects of entrainment, this  conference is likely to have strong impact on several areas of  neuroscience, including sensory systems, neuroendocrinology, and  behavior, as well as beyond neuroscience to endocrinology, and  animal and plant physiology.  The NSF emphasis on funding for  attendance by young investigators and those from underrepresented  groups will also have an impact on their careers.",
