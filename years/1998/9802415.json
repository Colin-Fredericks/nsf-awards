 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant is for support of students to attend the Second International Conference on Exotic Nuclei and Atomic Masses, ENAM98.  The conference is the second in a series that is the merger of the long running Atomic Mass Conference and the Nuclei Far From Stability Conference.  These conferences began in the late 1960s.  The tradition of the meeting is to gather in a remote location and review the progress in the field.  The advent of experiments with radioactive ion beams has increased the interest in this conference series.  ENAM98 will be held June 23 to June 27 in Northern Michigan at the Shanty Creek Resort.  It will be an excellent opportunity for students to get an overview of the science associated with radioactive ion beams.  Special sessions will be held for only students to over view the talks and allow them to ask questions.",
