Students will  both learn and live at the Station during the eight-week  summer session.  The research experience will be the sole  focus of their activities during that period.  Each selected  student will work with a faculty mentor, attend special  evening workshops, attend weekly discussion meetings, attend  general seminars at the Station, and develop his or her own  research project (from conception of  the ideas, through  collection of data, to verbal and written presentation of  the study).  Students will be selected on the basis of  academic excellence, letters of recommendation, and evidence  of interest in research.  After participation in the  program, each student will help in the evaluation of his or  her experience in the program.",
