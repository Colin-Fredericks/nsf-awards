 "awd_abstract_narration": "A primary focus of this research is to develop effective  computational methods for mixed integer programs. A nonlinear  interior-point based branch-and-bound solver will be developed,  emphasizing effective implementation of the nonlinear subproblem  solver within the tree search environment, and its practicality  in solving real-world instances. Parallelism will be exploited to  take advantage of concurrent computing and to enhance the  solver's capability for solving these NP-hard problems.    Another focus of this research is to explore new applications of  mixed integer programming. As applications provide invaluable  insight and motivation for advancing the frontiers of an evolving  discipline, the work will, in part, focus on structures arising  from practical applications. The first problem arises from the  computationally intensive area of statistical classification,  which has close connections with machine learning, neural  networks and pattern recognition. This work will build on  previous work involving a classification model  formulated initially as a nonlinear MIP. The novel aspects of the  model are that it allows a level of control on misclassification  probabilities and allows entities to be classified into a  reserved judgment region. Such an approach is well-suited for  applications in which misclassification can have  dire consequences (e.g., medical diagnosis). Variations in the  basic model will be explored in an attempt to uncover a version  that is both computationally tractable for large scale problems,  and effective in generating rules that yield accurate  classification.    A second application concerns treatment planning optimization for  brachytherapy --- a type of radiation therapy that involves  implanting radioactive sources (seeds) in or near tumors. The  optimal placement and dosage of the radioactive seeds in  brachytherapy is a challenging problem. A novel mixed integer  programming model has been developed, and the focus now lies  in developing effective co mputational strategies based on the  polyhedral structure of the model. Clinical computational tests  will be performed using data from prostate cancer cases. The  resulting optimization solver will be designed, along with  graphical evaluation tools, for real-time use in the operating  room.",
