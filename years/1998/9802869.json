The program's awards provide  opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or  complementary facilities, expertise and experimental  conditions abroad.    This award will support a twenty-four-month postdoctoral  research visit by Dr. Orin J. Percus to work with Dr.  Gennaro Chierchia at the Universita degli Studi di Milano in  Italy.    Dr. Percus' research is concerned with the general problem  in linguistics of how language encodes information, and how  a sentence's structure contributes information.  An  important result of modern linguistics is that the cognitive  systems underlying our use of language employ a number of  different kinds of discrete representations.  One kind of  representation indicates how words join together to form  larger units; another encodes what we think of as meaning.  Many assume that there is a procedure that maps  representation encoding structure to representation encoding  meaning.  The goal of Dr. Percus' research is to improve our  understanding of this procedure.      His host, Dr. Chierchia, is competent in both syntax and  semantics.  He is a leading formal semanticist, who is at  the forefront of the issues of what makes language learnable  and how linguistic variation is constrained.  ***",
