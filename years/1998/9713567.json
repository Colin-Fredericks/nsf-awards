 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713567   Sillman    The project investigates the chemistry of secondary species associated with ozone formation, specifically total reactive nitrogen compounds (NOy), peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and associated organic nitrates, hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides. These chemical species have been measured during a number of recent field measurement campaigns and for planned future campaigns in the eastern U.S., including the Middle Tennesee Ozone Study, the NARSTO study in the northeastern U.S. corridor, and the Ozone Photochemistry and Climatology Experiment in Peliston, MI.  The field data will serve as input into the photochemical models to be developed and evaluated for this project.   Model results will be compared with measured values for ratios of key organic peroxide compounds, along with other chemical indicators for ozone, NOx and reactive organic hydrocarbons (ROG).  Special emphasis will be placed on atmospheric removal rates for peroxides and nitric acid in model calculations, and on recent proposed changes and uncertainties in organic peroxide chemistry. An attempt will be made to derive atmospheric removal rates for peroxides and nitric acid by comparing measurements with different model scenarios. Implications for the use of peroxides as ozone-NOx-ROG indicators will be investigated.   Results from this modeling project will provide rigorous and detailed evaluations of ozone formation processes occurring in the lower troposphere over urban and rural continental areas of the northeastern U.S.",
