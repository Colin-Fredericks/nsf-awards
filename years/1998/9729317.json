 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the direction of Dr. Barbara Stark, Mr. Michael Ohnersorgen will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. He will examine the changes which resulted from the collapse of classic Mayan civilization and the emergence of the Aztec empire. During the Classic Mayan period, society was organized around small independent city-states or `kingdoms` with rural hinterlands surrounding each. Although trade among major centers took place, each was independent and essentially self sustaining. In Mexico this form of organization was replaced by a larger centralized Aztec empire in which Mayan type entities were more closely integrated into a more tightly defined system. With the absence of wheeled vehicles and domesticated animals the Aztec integrated most of Mexico and archaeologists wish to understand the political and economic mechanisms involved. Mr. Ohnersorgen's research focuses on this question. He will conduct an archaeological survey of the site of Cotaxtla which is located in Veracruz Mexico and will focus on the Postclassic period (A.D. 900-1521). Based on limited work to date, it is clear that Cotaxtla was originally independent and subsequently incorporated into the Aztec empire. Mr. Ohnersorgen will attempt to answer two basic questions: first, how did the Aztecs maintain control? Did they use direct (through, for example, the stationing of soldiers) or more indirect means? It appears that the Aztecs used different methods in different parts of their empire. Secondly, what was the economic impact of Aztec domination? How did the organization of production change? Did a wide range of manufacturing activities continue or did Cotaxtla become a specialized producer? Did the production of items such as obsidian tools take place on an individualized household or a more centralized level?  To accomplish these goals Mr. Ohnersorgen will conduct a survey of the site to locate mound groups and other areas of concentrated activity. On this basis he will use a laser transit to produce detailed maps. Surface collections of ceramics, lithics and other artifacts will then be made. These data will permit economic activities to be identified and their distribution plotted over space.  This research is important for several reasons. It will shed new light on how complex societies develop. It will provide data of interest to many archaeologists and assist in training a promising young scientist.",
