 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the problem of retargeting tools  used to  translate, analyze, instrument, improve, and migrate  programs.  Such  tools include not only compilers, but also assemblers,  linkers,  debuggers, binary-code modifiers, and binary translators.  The primary  retargeting technique being applied is the generation of  machine-dependent  components from compact, reusable descriptions of machine  properties.    The research objectives are to describe machine properties  clearly and concisely, to represent instruction semantics in  a way that supports retargeting, to reuse specifications to  retarget a variety of tools, and to reuse analyses of  specifications to derive components for multiple machines.  Instruction semantics are specified in three layers.  Descriptions of whole instruction sets will be written using  the metalanguage layer. These descriptions will be  mechanically transformed into the register-transfer layer,  which defines each instruction's semantics in  a form that is easy to analyze.  The interpretation layer  will provide semantic interpretations of register transfers;  different interpretations support different analyses and  component generators. The major payoff of this research is  in developing new capabilities in machine specification; it  should deepen our understanding of properties of machines,  foster innovation in machine-level tools, and help others  save effort, cost, and time in developing tools of  scientific and practical value.",
