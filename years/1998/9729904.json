University of South Florida    CISE Research Instrumentation: Acquisition of a Compute Server for Image Analysis Research that Emphasizes Empirical Performance Characterization    This research instrumentation grant contributes to the purchase of a compute   server for the lab research network at USF with four 250 Mhz UltraSparc   Processors, 1GB main memory, 35 GB of formatted disk pace, and a tape drive,   which will enable the following projects:- Automated Performance Evaluation of Edge Detectors,- Nonrigid Motion and Structure Recovery from 2D Views,  - Performance Evaluation of Perceptual Organization Modules, and - Automatic Tumor Volume Extraction from Brain MRI. This project deals with four image analysis tasks:  performance analysis of edge detector algorithms, algorithms for analysis of non-rigid motion in image sequences, the development and analysis of perceptual grouping algorithms, and the development of clustering-based algorithms for the segmentation of magnetic resonance images. These tasks are all computationally expensive. In addition, the studied empirical characterization of the performance of the algorithms is emphasized.  This style of research presents enormous computational demands, and it is not feasible to conduct this style of research with the typical workstation that an individual user would have on their desk. To make it practical to carry out this research, USL will acquire a compute server that will provide much greater computational power. This compute server will be shared among the research projects. Each of the projects is innovative and will lead to high-quality publications. In addition, the data sets and empirical methods that are created in these projects will have substantial impact on future research.",
