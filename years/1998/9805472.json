 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scope of work presented here is one attempt to work with existing structures (the One Sky, Many Voices program, the Center for Learning Technologies in Urban Schools) to strengthen research and understanding of the value and challenges of reform programs such as ours, as we strive towards widespread adoption of our programs by the most diverse audiences possible through scaling.    One Sky, Many Voices is one year old synergy of educators, atmospheric scientists, software developers, interface designers, and curriculum designers who have developed and researched one model of emerging and reliable technology-rich, inquiry-based programs for a very wide assortment of learners, including both in and out of traditional schooling.  Our first goal is extensive investigations of the relationships, supports, and models of curriculum adoption necessary for widespread adoption of our programs.  In this proposal, we outline a plan for design-experiment research which would allow us to study and evaluate models for curriculum adoption, teacher  professional development, and technological tools which change with scaling.  To implement widespread adoption, we aim to contrast two effective means of scaling, the Maverick and Distributed models, to be better understand best means of reaching many learning communities.  We propose to use the cadre of returning teachers, students and schools who are regular subscribers to our programs (Mavericks), and the Detroit and Chicago Public Schools, through the Center for Learning Technologies in Urban Schools, (Distributed) to scale our work and study scaling research.    Our second goal is to directly confront accountability.  While programs such as ours are sometimes characterized as \"successful\", the systemic characterizations of \"success\" in programs such as ours is far from understood.  Continually, schools and others are asked for better definitions of the value of this work, and better justification for the widespread adoption of expensive and difficult techn ology-rich, inquiry-based programs.  To confront accountability, we wish to use our many diverse sites, our experience developing accountability measures, and new technological opportunities to design and implement a new system which will provide a range of customized accountability measures which work with and expand ideas of accountability beyond standardized testing.  In combining scaling rersearch on better accountability, we hope to simultaneously achieve adoption of our program by the widest possible audiences, as we provide a wider range of accountability measures demanded by the pressures on today's schools.",
