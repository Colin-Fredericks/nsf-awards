Northeastern University    MRI: A High-Performance, Low-Cost Testbed for Network-based Research    This work involves development of high-performance commodity computing from commodity hardware, which opens up possibilities of much wider access to high-performance computing.  The premise is that efficient use of network, storage and computation resources, and the specification and provision of well defined qualities of service, are the critical core technologies.  Further, these technologies must keep costs low by not requiring significant modifications in commercial hardware or operating systems, and they must not require a significant increase in system administration overhead, which would be beyond what could be reasonably expected in less technical environments.  The research will take place within the new Egan Engineering Research Center at Northeastern University.  The investigators on this proposal are from the College of Computer Science, the Center for Digital Processing and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.  These units have a history of working collaboratively and of managing shared resources and all have research place in the Egan building in a very close proximity to the location where the proposed network will be place.",
