The general goals are the  development  of  procedures for the growth of  epitaxial  single-  crystalline  fims,  the  determination  of  their  structure  and  strains,   and   the  preparation  of  magnetic  nanowires   with  controlled  widths, lengths and separations.   Additionally,  the  stabilization  and  characterization  of  metastable  phases   of  magnetic  and  nonmagnetic  materials and  of  selected  magnetic  binary alloys.  %%%  In this research project Professors F.
