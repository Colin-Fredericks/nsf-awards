 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the interrelationships among technology, art and business through a study of the development of sound motion picture technology in the 1920s and early 1930s.  The successful application of amplified sound to motion pictures circa 1926 did not simply give voice to previously silent films:  the new technology fundamentally and dramatically changed how movies were made, who made them, what they were about, what they looked like, and how audiences received them.  The project will not only produce a much-needed history of the technological transformation of motion pictures during the `sound revolution,` it will also elaborate upon other topics of more general interest to historians and other scholars of technology.  Among these are the relationship between corporate structure and technological development, the nature of engineering work and the collaboration of engineers with others, and the permeability of the boundary between `technical` work and `aesthetic` work.  Corporate and studio archives, technical papers, personal memoirs, the films themselves and the machines that made them will provide the investigator with a rich variety of resources for this work.  The resulting book will be fully accessible to a non-scholarly readership as well as to a diverse array of scholars.",
