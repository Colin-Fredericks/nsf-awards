 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract  Capogna                     The main theme of this project is the study of the interior and boundary   regularity of minimizers for functionals that involve the \"horizontal\"  gradient of functions defined in a Carnot group or in a sub-Riemannian manifold.  Such functionals have a special interest both in geometry and partial   differential equations, and include  the energy functional  and the area functional. Among the applications of the regularity theory   one has the Dirichlet problem for subLaplacians, regularity and rigidity   properties for quasiconformal maps between Carnot groups and the geometry   of minimal surfaces. As a variation on the main theme, this projects also   includes the study of minimizers for a suitably defined energy of maps   with sub-Riemannian target.                The study of the regularity for minimizers of variational problems   has been  one of the main concerns in mathematics for centuries.  It is deeply related to the study of natural phenomenon, since in nature   the energy minimizing configurations are the most likely to appear.  If a minimizer is very regular then it is easy to study its structure.   Translated out of the mathematical formalism, this means  that  the  physical system  corresponding to a very regular minimizer   can be predicted very accurately. This observation is at the basis  of a wide range of applications, from meteorological forecasts  to the planning of a space shuttle launch (depending on the specific functional   and minimizer studied).  The variational problems involved in  this project are associated to a  special structure of the space that arises naturally in the study of many physical systems, among them thermodynamical systems  and crystalline materials. A main feature of this special structure is that not all   directions in space  are equivalent. It costs more to travel along some   directions than to move along others. The mathematical problems related to this   feature are very difficult and interesting.",
