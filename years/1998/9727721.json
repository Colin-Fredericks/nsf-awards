 "awd_abstract_narration": "Somero  9727721       Understanding how temperature-sensitive proteins are stabilized in  organisms that experience widely different temperatures has significance for  both basic and applied science. The PIs will examine two types of changes that  play major roles in temperature adaptation. First, changes in amino acid  sequences of proteins (their \"nature\") will be investigated. By determining  where adaptive substitutions occur in proteins of differently thermally-adapted  species, the PIs will gain a deeper understanding of how specific alterations  of protein sequence affect the molecules' structure and function, and how these  adaptive changes help to establish environmental tolerance limits. Temperature  changes of only a few degrees centigrade are adequate to perturb proteins and  affect organismal distribution patterns-a finding with clear implications for  models of global warming. Furthermore, an understanding of how evolutionary  processes alter protein stability will assist biotechnologists in developing  strategies for laboratory-engineering of protein stability.       Protein stability is also influenced by the small molecules and water  that bathe proteins in cells. The PIs will investigate how the aqueous  medium in which a protein functions helps to \"nurture\" the protein to  enhance stability. Discovery of novel stabilizing solutes could facilitate  development by biotechnologists of new types of solutions for the long-term,  safe storage of drugs, cells, and tissues.",
