The two-one hour tapes and an overview tape are produced by WGBH TV in partnership with Jobs for the Future (JFF) to be a professional development tool for preservice and inservice teachers.  Each tape is divided into three segments focusing on particular science content drawn from the science standards for grades 9-12.  Vignettes early and late in the year and at two different sites are shown to demonstrate growth and address the nature and extent of students' learning, future plans and attitude.  A thirty-minute documentary-style video, targeted to parents, policy-makers and the general public, presents an overview of school-to-career issues and promotes the concept as a way to generate scientific literacy.  Guided by the national science standards, appropriate skill standards and JFF's criteria for high quality work-based learning, the videos demonstrate that learning to know should not be separated from learning to do.  The tapes help schools visualize effective practice and employers visualize opportunities to provide work-based learning sites.  The project builds upon WGBH's experience in producing video libraries focused on standards-based teaching practices in mathematics and science.  The materials are field tested widely and distributed through multiple channels.  An advisory board guides the project and review the materials.\r\n\r\n",
