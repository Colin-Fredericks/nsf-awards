 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exchange is the essence of economics, and there is a large literature extolling the virtues of using money as a means of  exchange over other forms of exchange. Despite this, many trades do  not take the form of goods for cash, even in instances where money  could conceivably be used.  For instance, individuals provide favors  for one another, with the promise of a future reciprocated favor acting as implicit payment.  Similarly,  there is  considerable evidence from sociology and anthropology that there is  a marked reticence to use money in social relations. This proposal  considers why many trades remain non-monetized even in modern monetized economies.  We consider three separate aspects of  non-monetary trade in this proposal, namely, (i) the role of money  in reciprocal exchange, (ii) the use of money in social situations,  and (iii) the use of commercial barter exchanges. In each of these  settings, we illustrate novel reasons why agents may prefer to avoid  using fiat money despite its usual advantages in achieving a double  coincidence of wants, and may instead employ non-monetary exchange.  By addressing the importance of non-monetary exchange for  reciprocity, payment-in-kind, and barter markets, we develop a richer understanding of how agents trade, the most basic  ingredient of economics.",
