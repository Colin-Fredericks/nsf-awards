 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social  relationships among animals influence their behavior,  and  do  so  by  affecting the neural circuits and responses  that  control  behavior.  A  primary  link  between  social  status  and  behavior  occurs through the release of neuromodulators that  have  both  widespread  and targeted effects within the nervous  system.  One   neuromodulator,  serotonin,  has  been  implicated  in   the  expression  of  social  ordering behaviors  in  a  wide  range  of  vertebrates  and invertebrates, including primates, rodents,  fish  and  crustaceans.  The  neural mechanisms  that  link  serotonin's  effects  to  the expression of dominance status have been  studied  most   thoroughly  in  crustaceans,  particularly   lobsters   and  crayfish.         During  the current grant period the social dominance  status  of   a   crayfish  was  found  to  predict  the  effect   of   the  neuromodulator  serotonin on the neural circuit  for  the  taiflip  behavior.  Serotonin enhances the response of  the  Lateral  Giant  (LG) tailflip command neuron to its normal mechanosensory input in  isolated  crayfish and in socially dominant crayfish, and inhibits  the  cell  in  subordinate  animals. The differences  result  from  corresponding   differences  in  the   population   of   serotonin  receptors.         The  present  proposal continues this research by determining  the  sources  of  serotonin that modulate LG  in  freely  behaving  animals,  and by asking where and how serotonin has its  different  effects  on  LG  in the animals of different social status.  Blood  levels  of serotonin in freely behaving crayfish will be  measured  during  fights,  and  the responses of LG to serotonin,  serotonin  agonists   and   antagonists  will  be  measured   with   standard  electrophysiological techniques.",
