 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kleppa  9726699    This grant supports systematic investigations of the  thermochemistry of refractory materials.  These studies are  based on applications of a unique high-temperature reaction  calorimeter which is operated continuously at temperatures  up to about 1500K.  This calorimeter was developed with  special support from the NSF in 1987-88. During the coming  three years this investigation will be extended to the  compounds formed by the mildly radioactive actinide elements  thorium and uranium with the late transition metals and the  noble metals. The investigations plan a special modification  of the unique high-temperature reaction calorimeter which  will allow measurements of heats of mixing the heats of  solution in binary liquid alloys at temperatures up to about  1500K without introducing one of the two reactants from room  temperature.  The goal is to better understand the basis for  how thermodynamic properties of a binary system depends on  the character of its two constituents.  %%%  There have been few calorimetric studies of the  thermodynamic properties of uranium and thorium alloys based  on binaries with the transition metals.  This work adds to  the enthalpy data base for binary compounds of these  elements.  ***",
