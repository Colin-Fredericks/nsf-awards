Some practical aspects of the methods, including extensions to flows  in general 2D and 3D domains, and applications to more challenging  physical problems, will be investigated.  In the vorticity  formulation, a new time-stepping procedure is used for high Reynolds  number flows.  For such flows the convection and viscous terms are  treated explicitly. The stream function, and hence the velocity, is  then evaluated from the vorticity via the kinematic equation.  The key  to the efficiency of the new time-stepping procedure is that the value  of the vorticity on the boundary is obtained explicitly from the steam  function without any iteration.  This eliminates some traditional  difficulties associated with the vorticity formulation.  More akin to  the primitive variable formulation, the investigator is using a new  formulation of the NSE in the impulse density variable which differs  from the velocity by a gauge transformation. The gauge freedom enables  one to assign simple and specific boundary conditions for both the  impulse and gauge fields, thus eliminating some traditional  difficulties such as the pressure boundary condition.      This new class of efficient numerical methods has already been used  to study such real world problems as the investigation of the  mechanism of drag reduction on airfoils at high velocities, as well as  the development of severe storms in tropical latitudes.  These  methods provide an important tool that allow scientists and engineers  to study related  fluid problems in manufacturing and industry that  were previous unsolvable with currently available numerical  techniques.  They represent a significant step forward in the  efficient computation of solutions to such problems, and are naturally  suited for implementation on high performance massively parallel  computer architectures.",
