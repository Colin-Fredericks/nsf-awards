In  this  technique, a core photoelectron and its associated Auger electron  are  detected in time coincidence. This method is used  to  probe  electronic structure with high surface specificity and  to  study  extremely  low  defect  concentrations  on  oxide  surfaces.  The  systems   under   study   include  surface   alloys   Ag/Cu(100),  Au/Ni(110), Pd/Cu(100 and Ag/Pd(100). The surface atoms intermix,  even  though  the  components are immiscible  in  the  bulk.  Low  dimensional systems and interactions between molecular adsorbates  and  surface defects are also of interest. A large portion of the  work  is carried out at the National Synchrotron Light Source  at  Brookhaven   National  Laboratory.  This  research   program   is  interdisciplinary in nature and involves one or more postdoctoral  and   graduate  students,  who  receive  excellent  training   in  preparation  for careers in industry, government laboratories  or  academia.  %%%  This  experimental  research project is concerned  with  advanced  methods  to  study the outermost atomic layers of a sample.  Such  surface  analysis methods typically employ a light (photon)  beam  falling on the sample, which can lead to other electron(s) and/or  light  being ejected. In the present work the detected  particles  are an electron and a photon, which are coincident in time, which  is  an indication that they both come from the same atomic event.  This  method  of   \"Auger-Photoelectron Coincidence  Spectroscopy  (APECS)\"  is  used  to  focus on local electronic  properties  of  surface alloys, ultrathin metal films, and layered compounds. The  systems   under   study   include  surface   allo ys   Ag/Cu(100),  Au/Ni(110), Pd/Cu(100 and Ag/Pd(100).
