The unique camera design, which has been termed the  Energy-Subtraction Compton Scatter Camera (ESCSC), could  revolutionize medical imaging while using existing technologies.  The clinical implementation of this design may enhance  sensitivity by a factor of over 100, while maintaining or  improving spatial resolution, as compared with existing clinical  single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) cameras.  Furthermore, significant clinical implications of the improved  sensitivity realized by the ESCSC include: shorter imaging times  (resulting in reduced motion blur, faster patient throughput, and  greater patient comfort); reduced patient/worker radiation  exposure; more effective diagnostic imaging for patients  undergoing subsequent cancer therapy; and very likely reduced  cost both for the initial capital investment and in terms of  maintenance and staffing.  Additionally, the proposed system  would be more compact, more portable, and less cumbersome to  operate than current cameras.  To implement this design,  fundamental shifts in data acquisition and analysis over current  imaging systems are required.  To produce a clinical ESCSC  design, it is proposed to: 1) optimize all aspects of the camera  using simulations, along with experimental data; 2) characterize  components to optimize performance; 3) develop an optimal data  acquisition scheme; and 4) develop image reconstruction  algorithms.    The education component of this project involves developing two-  and three-dimensional animations illustrating radiation science  and technology topics and will be used in part to convey the  significance of medical imaging research to all audiences.  More  specifically, a) the interactions of radiation with matter, b)  the response o f most radiation detectors, and c) the behavior of  complex electronic systems, such as the proposed ESCSC, can be  much better comprehended by an audience when animations are used  to simulate the process(es). Consequently, the objectives of the  educational aspect of this proposal are to develop the expertise  necessary to produce two- and three-dimensional animations and  interactive computer exercises, then to use them in: 1) the  undergraduate and graduate radiation detection and measurement  curricula; 2) junior high and high school teacher workshops,  which are aimed at helping these educators effectively teach  their students about radiation science and technology; 3) an  introductory course in medical imaging to be developed; and 4)  presenting the results of this and other research projects.  In  addition, these animations could be very useful in helping to  improve patient understanding about the medical procedures they  are considering or have been recommended to have.  ***",
