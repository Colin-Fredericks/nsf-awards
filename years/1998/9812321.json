 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hoyt  9812321  The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) is sponsoring a research conference on Yeast Chromosome Structure, Replication and Segregation in the summer of 1998.  This meeting will be the fifth in a biennial series focused on understanding in detail the organization of yeast chromosomes, their replication and segregation.  Each of these meetings was considered to be highly successful by many of the participants.  In fact, many participants feel that this is the most important meeting in their field.  There was unanimous support among the attendees of the last conference to convene again in 1998.  A main objective of the conference is to bring together a relatively small group of leading researchers in this field to discuss the results of recent work and to provide the best possible circumstances for the exchange of ideas and information.  It is the only conference specifically devoted to this topic.  This meeting is very well attended by many scientists in this field.  In addition, the organizers of the meeting encourage the participation of female and minority researchers and younger, less well established scientists, including postdoctoral fellows and graduate students.  Chromosomes carry the genetic information in the nuclei of all organisms.  Results of studies of yeast chromosome structure, replication and segregation to daughter cells are relevant to our understanding of the chromosomal processes carried out in all eukaryotes.",
