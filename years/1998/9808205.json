 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore how the attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix controls cell division.  The project is based on preliminary observations that when liver cells grown in culture attach to a rigid collagen film, these cells spread, grow and divide.  In contrast, when the same cells are grown on a collagen gel, they attach to the gel but fail to spread and divide.  The apparent reason that these latter cells do not divide is that they do not express a specific control protein called cyclin D1 that is necessary for the cells to progress from their growth phase (designated the G1 phase of the cell cycle) through the rest of the cell division cycle.  What causes this block is unclear.  The hypothesis that will be tested is that cyclin D1 transcription results from the activation of a signaling pathway that requires cell spreading on an appropriate extracellular matrix.  The hypothesis implies that attachment to the matrix is necessary but not sufficient for cell division and that rearrangement of the cytoskeleton may also be required.  The hypothesis will be tested with three specific experimental aims. The first aim is to determine whether cells that over-express cyclin D1 can overcome cell division arrest when they are grown on collagen gels.  The second aim is to measure the increase in transcription of cyclin D1 messenger RNA that is induced by collagen films.   The mechanism by which transcription of this gene is regulated will also be addressed.  The third aim is to measure and vary the activity of key molecules of important signaling pathways that may be activated when cells are grown on different collagen substrates.  Changes in cyclin D1 activity and cell division will be correlated with rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton.  The significance of the project extends to the broad impact it will have on our understanding of how the interactions  of cells with the extracellular matrix affect diverse functions from cytoskeletal dynamics to gene expression and cell division.",
