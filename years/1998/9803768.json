 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803768  Pantelides  This award supports electronic structure theory  investigations of atomic-scale mechanisms that underlie the  nucleation and growth of nano-scale structures.  The PI's  previous work has shown that the study of defect complexes  can lead to the prediction of potentially self-assembled,  novel, ordered structures of point defects or defect  complexes. These structures correspond to a subtle balance  between `chemistry' that leads to low coordination and  `crystallinity' that generally dictates  high coordination.  The proposed research entails the investigation of specific  systems, selected because of the anticipated effect of  defect complexes on the material's electrical and optical  properties; the demonstrated or anticipated self-assembly of  ordered structures with potential for nanodevices or  nanowires; anticipated novel interplay between `chemistry'  and `crystallinity'; or any combination of these criteria.  Examples include the possibility of ordered F impurities in  Si that may lead to embedded nanowires and the nucleation  and growth of As complexes that may control both the  properties of the low-temperature-grown GaAs and the  observed self-assembly of ordered spherical As precipitates.  %%%  The PI will perform computational research on atomic length  scales to determine how specific defects in materials affect  their electronic and optical properties and how desirable  defects can be introduced into a material. The purposeful  manipulation of defect structures in materials to produce  specific properties holds promise for the `engineering' of  electronic devices on the atomic scale.  ***",
