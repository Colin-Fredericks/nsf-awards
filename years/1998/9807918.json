 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dramatic progress in the field of developmental biology in recent years has resulted from the application of a number of new approaches to classical problems, and led to the need for advanced courses to train new investigators to study those animal models, such as Xenopus, that have been important in making new discoveries in this field. The PI proposes to continue the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory course on \"Early Development of Xenopus laevis\", which has now been taught for five years as part of an integrated set of courses at Cold Spring Harbor in a number of areas of modern biology. This course provides extensive laboratory exposure to the biology and manipulation of embryos from the frog Xenopus laevis. Xenopus is a vertebrate uniquely suited for studies of early development, since large numbers of embryos, from fertilization onward, can easily be obtained. Development is rapid and the large size of the embryos facilitates their micromanipulation to allow analysis of such important issues as embryonic inductions, even at the single cell level, that are not feasible in mammalian, avian or fish embryos. The course is suited both for those who have a knowledge of molecular biology and developmental biology, but have had no experience with Xenopus, as well as those with some Xenopus experience who wish to learn newly developed, advanced techniques.",
