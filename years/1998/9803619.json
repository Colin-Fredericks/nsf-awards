 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803619\r\nHe\r\n     Infinitesimal deformation of disk patterns in the plane can be\r\ncharacterized by harmonic functions on an electric network that is\r\nobtained by a simple geometric construction.  Properties of the\r\nelectrical network may be used to derive rigidity properties of disk\r\npatterns.  The technique may also be applied to prove characterizations\r\nof three-dimensional convex hyperbolic polyhedra, generalizing both\r\nAndreev's Theorem and a characterization theorem due to Hodgson and\r\nRivin.  The investigator will explore relationships between the\r\ndeformation of disk patterns and that of three-dimensional hyperbolic\r\ncone-manifolds, and study the applications of these results to other\r\nfields.  He will also continue the research on the Koebe uniformization\r\nconjecture.\r\n     The study of geometry and topology in two and three dimensions are\r\nintimately related.  Many three-dimensional geometric topology problems\r\nmay be reduced to problems in two dimensions, and geometric structures\r\nmay be applied to solve topological problems.  This project's research\r\non disk patterns, three-dimensional hyperbolic polyhedra, circle\r\ndomains and disk packings, three-dimensional geometric structures and\r\ntheir applications, and on topological hydrodynamics, will contribute\r\nto a better understanding of the geometry and physics of our real world.\r\nIt is also an interesting fact that geometric structures on manifolds\r\ncan be applied to yield information on their topology, and in turn the\r\ninformation on their topology may be used in some problems in\r\nhydrodynamics.  There is a related study of Moebius energy of knots and\r\nlinks, where several most elementary questions remain unsolved. This is\r\na field where theory and experiment meet well.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
