 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program (CRIF) will assist the Department of Chemistry at The University   of Oregon to  acquire an atomic force microscope/scanning tunneling   microscope (AFM/STM).  This equipment, which is to be   used for the characterization of rationally synthesized nanoscale   assemblies, will enhance research in a number of areas, including (i)   hybrid organic/inorganic self-assembled multilayers; (ii) ordered one-   and two-dimensional nanocrystal arrays; (iii) thin-film conducting   polymer interfaces; (iv) inorganic nanolaminates; and (v) semiconductor   quantum dot materials and devices.  The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) enables researchers to image   atoms directly. The technique uses the piezoelectric effect which   involves bringing an extremely sharp metal needle within a few angstroms   of the sample surface. The distance is small enough for electrons to leak   or tunnel across the gap and generate a minute current. As the gap   between the tip and the sample increases, the current decreases. As the   probe crosses the sample, moving back and forth across the surface, it   traces out a contour map of the sample's surface atoms. The AFM is used   in the control of material used to fabricate semiconductor circuits.",
