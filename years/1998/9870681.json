 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870681  Fertig    The PI plans to investigate how orderly spatially modulated  structures in two dimensions interact with a pinning  potential. Pinning potentials include impurities and  artificial materials patterns and structures. A major  fraction of the proposed work is concerned with the electron  gas in two dimensions.  The study focuses on three areas:  the response of spin textures in quantum Hall systems to an  array of artificial structures, the response of pinned  Wigner crystals to low frequency electromagnetic fields, and  the role of plastic deformation on pinning processes in  vortex lattices that occur in superconductors.  %%%  This research is at the forefront of condensed matter theory  and is concerned with how electrons confined to a plane and  composite particles made up of electrons that participate in  a spatially ordered state, respond to defects such as  impurities and artificial structures. These problems  represent new challenges to theoretical descriptions of  layered materials and electronic phenomena that occur in  materials and at interfaces of materials. The PI's work will  contribute to developing new methods to understand  electronic phenomena that occur in materials and that are  potentially important in developing new device technologies.  ***",
