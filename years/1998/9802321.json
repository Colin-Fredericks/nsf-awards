 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hacke  9802321  This award supports a 24-month research visit by Dr. Peter  L. Hacke, currently a Postdoctoral Fellow, Institute of  Physical and Chemical Research  (RIKEN), Japan, for  collaboration with Dr. Toshiyuki Tanahashi, Electron Devices  and Materials Laboratories, Fujitsu Laboratories, Ltd.,  Atsugi, Japan.  Their research is concerned with the growth  and characterization of InGaN active layers for improved  blue-emitting laser diodes.  Characterization of these  diodes is essential to finding solutions to problems which  limit the operation, performance, and lifetime of these  devices in commercial instruments.    The research will be conducted at Fujitsu Laboratories which  has a coherent group presently working on issues related to  the operation of blue light laser diodes.  Fujitsu is one of  only a few companies worldwide reporting successful  operation of a nitride-based blue laser diode.  During his  previous work in Japan, Dr. Hacke has visited the Fujitsu  Laboratories and is aware of the research interests and  capabilities of this research group.  To this point in his  career, Dr. Hacke has been engaged in fundamental research.  The proposed research at Fujitsu Laboratories will provide  experience in product development.  This project is  supported under the Science Fellowship Program between the  National Science Foundation and the Japan Foundation Center  for Global Partnership.",
