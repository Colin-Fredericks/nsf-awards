 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern telecommunication systems demand high performance  circuit components  that can operate at billions of cycles  per second. Such components must also work in extreme  environment such as high and low temperature. For example,  components in a cellular phone must operate properly whether  it is  used in Texas during the summer or in Alaska during  the winter. Furthermore, these components must be  economically competitive. These strict technical and  economical challenges call for new approaches at the  component level. The recent advances in fabrication of  minute mechanical  devices may make possible the  implementation of high-frequency components  that can  address the aforementioned challenges. This research  involves the design of micromachined electro-mechanically  tunable capacitors for RFIC applications in the 1-2 GHz  range. The investigators are examining the effects of  various physical phenomena such  as gravity, shock, ware,  and temperature on tunable capacitor characteristics. The  researchers are also studying the feasibility of RF voltage  controlled oscillators and electronically tunable filters  based on  these micromachined devices. RF switches are also  being investigated. A prototype two-plate micromachined  varactor is being fabricated in MUMPS polysilicon surface  micromachining technology and has a nominal capacitance  of  2 pF, a tuning range of 1.5:1, a maximum control voltage of  4 Volts, and  a Q-factor of 20 at 1 GHz. The first prototype  voltage controlled oscillator based on such micromachined  tunable capacitor oscillates at 1.35  GHz, has a tuning  range of 2 percent, and has a phase noise of -98.5 dBc/Hz at  100 kHz offset from the carrier.",
