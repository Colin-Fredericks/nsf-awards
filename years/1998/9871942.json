 "awd_abstract_narration": "9871942  Coleman  Constructing a Long-Term Ecological Research Program at the NTS  In order to move Nevada s university system to a world-class level  of competitiveness, a panel of nationally recognized experts has  recommended that the State of Nevada: (1) develop state centers of  excellence, based on scientific strength, uniqueness, fundability,  and consistency with the state s long-range science plan and (2)  exploit the unique opportunities of the Nevada Test Site (NTS). The  experts also explicitly identified Nevada s Global Environmental  Change Program (NevGEC) as a potential target area. The current  project is consistent with these recommendations and will add the  experimental infrastructure and remote sensing technology necessary  to integrate investigations of potential long-term changes of a  desert ecosystem to increased precipitation, increased nitrogen  deposition, and degradation of a microbiotic crust that lives on  the surface of desert soil to ongoing work on the effects of  elevated CO2 on an intact desert ecosystem at the Nevada Desert  Face Facility (NDFF) on the NTS. This project will:  (1) help  solidify a scientific center of excellence in Nevada and thus  potentially have a very positive short-term impact on Nevada s  research competitiveness; (2) benefit the entire state as the  NevGEC Program is a unique collaboration between the three main  research institutions in Nevada; (3) address an issue of ecological  importance to Nevada and to the world, and (4) create a world-class  research facility on the NTS, a site that is critical to Nevada s  long-term economic development.",
