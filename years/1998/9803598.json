 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803598  Wu   The aim of this research is the study of random spatial systems on the finite   dimensional hypercubic lattices and  infinite dimensional hyperbolic lattices.  Three topics   concerning percolation, Ising (ferromagnetic) models, and contact processes will be   studied. The first topic concerns percolation and Ising models on hyperbolic lattices.    Although Ising models and percolation on the hypercubic lattices have been studied   intensively and extensively since they were introduced, these models on hyperbolic lattices   have just started to receive attention from physicists and mathematicians.  They are found,   by both numerical studies and mathematical proofs, to exhibit a phenomenon of multiple   phase transitions.  Although a few results have been rigorously proved, many statements   suggested by numerical studies are to be proved;  and many more are to be explored.  The   second topic concerns a roughening transition of (independent and dependent) percolation   on the hypercubic lattices with dimensions larger than or equal to three. This is the   analogy of a roughening transition of ferromagnetic Ising models. The third topic is about   a phase transition of models with low-dimensional inhomogeneity.  These models include   percolation, Ising ferromagnetic systems and contact processes.   This research by an investigator at an undergraduate institution involves the study   of percolation and interacting particle systems. These are probabilistic models, which have   been useful in understanding physical systems. Further understanding of these probabilistic   models can be helpful to physicists.",
