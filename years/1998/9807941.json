 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-07941  KORN      Heart, brain, endocrine and muscle cells are called excitable  cells, and rely on the precisely coordinated action of many ion  channels for their function. These channels in the plasma membrane  of the cell open and close in response to physiological  stimulation, and allow the flux of ions into or out of the cell.  Flux of calcium and sodium ions through their respective channels  tends to subserve excitatory functions, and flux of potassium  through potassium channels underlies many inhibitory functions.  Although control of excitable behavior is extremely complex, the  magnitude and time-course of potassium flux through potassium  channels is often a critical factor in determining the duration of  excitatory events. There are many different potassium channels,  with subtly different structures. This subtle structural variation  among channels results in a large degree of functional diversity.  Both the magnitude and time-course of potassium channel activity  is sensitive to the concentration of potassium and sodium ion in  the extracellular space (the region just outside of a cell), and  this sensitivity also varies among channels. Two potassium binding  sites have been functionally isolated, a low affinity site that  underlies some channel functions and a high affinity site that  underlies others. In particular, the high affinity site, located  at the \"selectivity filter,\" underlies the ability of potassium to  prevent sodium from passing through the cell. The low affinity  site is not involved in selectivity but is involved in several  other channel functions. Recent structural studies have identified  the molecular location of the selectivity filter, and the  associated high affinity site(s). These studies were unable to  identify a cation binding site external the site of selectivity.  Consequently, either one of these putative high affinity sites  contributes to the low affinity site functions or there is an as  yet unknown cation binding site, external to the st ructurally  described sites, which cannot be observed in structural studies.  The primary focus of these studies will be to determine whether  the structurally described selectivity filter site(s) interconvert  between low affinity and high affinity sites, or whether a low  affinity site exists external to and independent from the high  affinity site. The studies will combine molecular biological  techniques with electrophysiological recordings and biophysical  analysis to determine whether the different functionally-  identified binding sites are structurally distinct. Results from  this project will enhance our understanding of the nature of  cation binding sites in the channel pore, and will thus enhance  our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that underlie phenotypic  diversity in potassium channels.",
