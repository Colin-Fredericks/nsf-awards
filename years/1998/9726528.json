 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award provides support for US-France cooperative research on the   speciation of lead, arsenic and zinc in smelter-impacted soils and mining wastes collected   from locations in France (Ardeche and Allier) and locations in the United States   (Leadville, Colorado and the Mother Lode Country of California).  The collaboration   involves researchers Gordon E. Brown at Stanford University and George Calas at the   University of Paris VI and VII).  Speciation of contaminant elements is a major   determinant of their mobility, toxicity, bioavailability and fate in the environment.  In order   to determine factors affecting speciation and transformation of species, the investigators   will perform parallel studies of chemical processes affecting these contaminant elements.    Synchrotron facilities at Stanford and University of Paris will be used in these studies.  The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in environmental geochemistry   and x-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  This is   complemented by French technical expertise in synchrotron x-ray fluorescence mapping   and diffraction analysis.  The project will improve the scientific basis for risk assessment   and remediation design for these toxic heavy elements.",
