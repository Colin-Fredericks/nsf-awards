 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Oregon operates the Oregon Institute of  Marine Biology (OIMB) as a field station that supports  research and educational activities focusing on  ecological interactions and organismal functions in  marine and estuarine environments.  Resident faculty,  visiting scientists, post doctoral researchers, and  graduate students conduct research year round, and three  terms of course work are offered for undergraduate and  graduate students.  The Institute is currently undergoing  a period of modest growth in both facilities and programs  guided by a programmatic and facilities planning  document.  New facilities, increased visitor use, and the  addition of courses for environmental science students at  the University of Oregon have made it essential that OIMB  we improve its computer network to provide more reliable  access.  This project will allow to improve OIMB its  computer network to:        1.  Accommodate new construction of a library and an  estuarine and coastal research laboratory, and  renovation of a building to a new research laboratory.        2.  Replace the existing network wiring with a  switched  Ethernet capable of handling larger loads at faster  speeds.        3.  Expand the network to research and housing spaces  for visiting scientists, and to the teaching  laboratories.        4.  Add three new work stations for use in the  teaching  laboratories.",
