 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMI-9800434  Lin  Integrated mesoscopic electro-mechanical manufacturing is a critical issue in design and manufacturing of sensors and actuators. Mesoscopic mechanical structures (100 micrometers to a few millimeters) are bridges between the macroscopic systems such as \"mechatronics systems\" and the microscopic systems such as \"microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).\" Although numerous processes have been demonstrated for the manufacturing of mechatronics systems and MEMS, very few of them have addressed the issues of integrated mesoscopic electro-mechanical manufacturing. The objectives of this project are to: (1) Develop a batch manufacturing process for mesoscopic mechanical structures, and (2) Integrate mesoscopic mechanical components with microelectronics. Several key processes will be established to achieve these objectives, including fabrication of precision mold insert, sacrificial layer replication, replication of structural layer, and final electro-mechanical integration.   The research will likely lead to new knowledge and techniques which are important to the design and manufacturing of integrated sensors and actuators in the mesoscopic range.",
