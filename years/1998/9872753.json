 "awd_abstract_narration": "Morehouse College was established a arrangement with the National  Consortium  on  Violence  Research  (NCOVR)  of  Carnegie  Mellon  University an NSF supported center.    The  focus  of the project on violence research is to expand  the  existing infrastructure of Morehouse College to conduct basic and  exploratory  research  on the etiology  of  violence  and  social  behavior,  to  plan  and  test  interventions  and  programs  for  violence reduction, to train a cadre of undergraduate students in  social  science research with the idea that these  students  will  pursue  graduate study in the areas of violence research  and  to  implement programs for education and community outreach  designed  to  improve the quality of life of Americans by reducing  violent  incidents  and  resultant fear of crime.  The  specific  research  areas  that  the Project will address will include, but  are  not  limited  to, the origins of violence, the economics of  violence,  the  legal aspects of violence, behavior modification techniques,  dysfunctional  families and their impact  on  violence,  domestic  abuse  and  best  intervention strategies.  Each of  the  project  areas identified above will be headed by a senior researcher from  Morehouse or NCOVR and the teams will include both junior faculty  and  undergraduate  students  from Morehouse  and  other  Atlanta  University Center (AUC) schools.  They believe that the  outcomes  of  these  efforts  will lead to a better  understanding  of  the  populations   studied  and  establish  priorities   for   further  research.   In  addition, this project will produce  a  cadre  of  undergraduates   trained  in  the  methodologies   and   theories  necessary  to  pursue study in violence research at the  graduate  level.    The strength of this proposal lies in the presence of an existing  research   institute  (The  Morehouse  Research  Institute)   and  amplified   by   the  additional  expertise  and  experience   of  researchers  and  practitioners in the  Atlanta University  Center  (AUC).   The  AUC is a consortium of 6 independent  colleges  and  universities   primarily   serving   minority   students.     The  institutions  to  be involved in this project  include  Morehouse  College,  Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University,  and  Morris  Brown  College.  Each of these institutions is designated  as  an  HBCU.    The   combined   undergraduate   enrollment   of   these  institutions  is  approximately 12, 000 students  per  year.   As  such, this project has the potential to recruit students from the  largest  assemblage of African American students  in  the  United  States.   Although,  Morehouse College will  serve  as  the  core  institution  for  this initiative, faculty and students  for  the  other   AUC  institutions  will  be  active  participants.    The  combination of these diverse institutions - with overlapping  and  complementing  missions - will create research and  dissemination  strengths unlikely to exist in a single institution or consortium  of  institutions  orchestrated for  this  specific  purpose.   To  augment  the  research  capabilities of  the  Morehouse  faculty,  researchers  from NCOVR will be brought to bear in  the  proposed  research agenda.    Morehouse College already has in place a management team which is  experienced   in   managing   a  complex,   multimillion   dollar  ($5,000,000  over  five  years) Department  of  Defense  project.  Additionally,   a  National  Advisory  committee  consisting   of  scholars,  professionals and people knowledgeable about  criminal  behavior,  crime,  violence and substance  abuse  prevention  and  health  promotion  has  already  been  established  and  consults  regularly  with the Morehouse Research Institute.  As  they  will  illustrate  in  the  proposal, Morehouse has a  long  history  of  collaboration  and  active involvement with  community-based  and  institutional  efforts.   Further, Morehouse  College  enjoys  an  excellent  working  relationship  with   the  Center  for  Disease  Control and Prevention",
