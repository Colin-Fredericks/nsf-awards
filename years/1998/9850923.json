 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests equipment to establish an inquiry-based, problem-solving, constructivist introductory geology laboratory experience with a particular emphasis on pre-college teachers.  West Chester University is renovating a laboratory room that will be dedicated to introductory geology instruction, and this grant will provide the equipment required for students to personally participate in the range of activities that constitute Earth science. The lab curriculum is designed to engage students in three multi-week, continuing investigations that require them to collect observations and data, graphically and statistically analyze their data, formulate reasonable interpretations to specific scenarios, and present this range of information to classmates. These investigations address: 1) Earth Materials through a \"tabloid\" who-dun-it mystery where students will study Earth materials within the context of forensic geology; 2) Surficial Processes through the study of the \"real value\" of real estate (where students learn the potential hazards associated with purchasing a home), and 3) Earth Systems Science through development and testing of computer models (using Stella software) for the past history of the Earth in order to understand the \"precision\" associated with global change predictions generated by computer GCM's. Faculty instruct all labs and we envision each faculty member customizing his instructional approach using the variety of equipment requested. A critical part of this proposal is the participation by an expert on assessment from the School of Education of West Chester University, whose expertise will allow us to determine the relative effectiveness of our individualized instruction designs.  Pre-teaching students will also study the evaluation procedure as an integral part of their educational training.  The Introductory Geology course frequently fulfills the natural science general education requirement for pre-teachers and is required of pre-teachers in the science program.  A pproximately 100 future teachers a year will participate in this course. t is anticipated that the participation of these future teachers in an inquiry-based course will improve student understanding of science processes and model inquiry pedagogical strategies.",
