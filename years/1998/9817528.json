 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the statistical agency of the U.S. Department of Education, seeks funds for support of survey data collection activities for the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS-R) in 1999.  A survey of 8th grade students their teachers and school administrators would be administered in the United States, and in several participating countries.  The purpose is to determine whether the international standing of U.S. student achievement levels of the 4th grade cohort of 1995 has changed by 1999 when the students have become 8th graders.  The data collection will result in a public announcement and report of the results of the survey.  States and local school districts will be encouraged to participate in the study for the purpose of comparing their own standing with that of the participating countries.",
