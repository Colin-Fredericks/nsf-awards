 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on asynchronous, or self-timed, design.  Such designs eliminate the global synchronizing clock, thus  permitting higher performance, scalability, and lower power.  The project is investigating problems in datapath design:  (1) the design of high-performance and low-power datapath  components, and (2) a system-level application to compressed-  code embedded processors. In (1), a technique, \"speculative  completion\", for designing asynchronous datapath components  which give high performance, yet have little area and power  overhead is being developed. This technique allows use of  existing synchronous components, with small amounts of added  circuitry and a multi-slotted completion signal, to allow  early completion. As part of this research, (a) the  technique is being applied to design fast adders,  multipliers, and comparators; and (b) new optimizations are  being developed, which target statistically-skewed (i.e. non-  random) input data that appear in real-world applications.  In (2), research activity being carried out is focused on a  system-level application: the design of embedded systems  with compressed memories. The investigation includes (a)  exploration and evaluation of a variety of memory  compression techniques; (b) design of a small and fast  asynchronous decompression circuit, which can decompress  such memories, on the fly, at acceptable rates.",
