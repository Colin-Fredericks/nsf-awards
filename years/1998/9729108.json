 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the interactions between the syntax and phonology of languages of the Makassar group from South Sulawesi, Indonesia. The Makassar languages, which with the increasing influence of Bahasa Indonesia are in serious danger of becoming extinct within the next few generations, have a rich inventory of affixes and clitics that signal, among other things, subject and object agreement, definiteness, possession, and plurality, and various aspects of derivational morphology. They are a fertile ground for testing hypotheses concerning the relationships between syntactic and prosodic structure. The aims of the project are (i) to provide a detailed description of the affixal system of these languages; (ii) to ground this description in careful analysis of both the syntax and the phonology of the languages; (iii) to investigate the general principles governing the mapping between the syntactic, morphological, and prosodic structure of the languages; and (iv) to place these results in the wider context of a comparative approach to grammatical theory; and (iv) to prepare and make widely available a database which will serve as a resource for researchers interested in Indonesian languages and/or in any of the grammatical areas covered in the project. The project has the potential to contribute to the further development of our understanding of the structure of human language by providing a thorough documentation of parts of the syntax, morphology, and phonology of a little known group of uncommonly studied languages, and extensive investigation of the implications of the data for the theory of grammar.",
