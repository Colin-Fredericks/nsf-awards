The  hypothesis   being  investigated is that intermediate valence states lie near  e/f  =  1,  as  well  as  the  heavy Fermion superconducting  state.  The  experimental  program  will  study  doped  UBe13,   CeIn3   under  pressure,  the  alloy series Sr1-xSmx B6 and single  crystals  of  various  intermediate  valence materials.  Temperature  dependent  transport, thermodynamic and optical properties will be  studied.  The research provides excellent training for graduate students in  the areas of materials synthesis and characterization.  %%%  This  experimental  condensed matter  physics  program  seeks  to  understand  how  the  loss of magnetism in a compound,  happening  through changing pressure applied to the compound or changing the  chemistry of the compound, leads to essentially new properties of  such  compounds, most notably superconductivity.  The  hypothesis  around  which  the  experiments are organized is  that  the  most  interesting  physical properties occur near where the  number  of  charge  carriers  equals  the number of  magnetic  sites  in  the  compound.  Magnetic,   electrical  and  optical  properties   are  measured.  The  work  is addressing questions  important  to  the  physics of high temperature superconductivity, as well as  exotic  magnetically  based superconductors and insulators. The  research  provides excellent training for graduate students in the areas of  materials synthesis and characterization.  ***",
