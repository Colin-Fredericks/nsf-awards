 "awd_abstract_narration": "9807172  Pothen    Preconditioning is a technique for improving the convergence of  iterative methods for solving  large, sparse systems of linear equations. The most robust preconditioners available to date are based on computing incomplete factors of the coefficient matrix, i.e., factors  that include only a small subset of the nonzero elements created during  the factorization. New algorithms for computing incomplete factor preconditioners for unsymmetric and symmetric matrices on serial and parallel  computers will be designed and implemented in this project. These algorithms have two phases: in the first symbolic factorization phase,  the positions in which the incomplete factors have nonzeros are identified, and data structures for the incomplete factors  are set up. In the second numerical factorization phase, these  data structures are used to compute the numerical values of the preconditioners in time proportional to the number of arithmetic  operations. Without the first symbolic factorization phase, the second phase   cannot be implemented  efficiently. The new symbolic factorization algorithms rely on a structure theory developed for identifying the positions in which the incomplete factors have  nonzero elements. The nonzero  elements in the incomplete factors are identified from the path structure  of  a graph model of the problem. Two graph reduction techniques, transitive reduction and symmetric reduction, are used to reduce the data needed to predict the fill, and thereby to  obtain fast symbolic factorization algorithms. The new algorithms can be proven to require less time  than the currently used algorithm, and preliminary implementations show that they  are faster by an order of magnitude or more  in problems with high fill.       Methods for solving large, sparse, linear systems of equations are workhorses for  solving partial differential equations from scientific and engineering models. Hence these fields will benefit from the algorithms and software developed in this pro ject. These  preconditioners will be used to solve specifically the Helmholtz problem in acoustics and Maxwell's equations in computational electromagnetics. The software developed from this project will be integrated with the PETSc (Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computing) package  from Argonne National Laboratories for wide dissemination.",
