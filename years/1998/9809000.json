 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent research has demonstrated the automaticity of much of social perception. Stereotypes have been found to become active automatically upon the presence of the group features (e.g., skin color, gender), and behaviors have been found to be automatically categorized in trait terms. In recent research, the PI expanded on these findings to investigate other direct and preconscious effects that the social environment has on psychological phenomena. The current project addresses the next natural question: What is the adaptive significance of these various automatic responses to the environment? One possibility is that they serve a general signaling or appraisal function. Another is that they help smooth social interactions. This research investigates the influence of preconscious thought processes, such as those triggered by particular situations and racial groups, on behaviors, such as task persistence and hostility, which occur without the person's awareness of why they are behaving that way. As such, this research is studying the mechanism of unconscious motivations. Among the implications of this work will be insights into the pervasiveness of discrimination against certain groups and the prospects for change.",
