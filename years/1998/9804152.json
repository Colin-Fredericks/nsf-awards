 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in  Biosciences Related to the Environment for 1998.  This  fellowship provides an opportunity for the Fellow to gain  additional scientific training beyond the doctoral degree  and to pursue innovative and imaginative research into the  fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between  organisms and their environment at the molecular, cellular,  organismal, population, community and/or ecosystem level in  any area of biology supported by the Directorate for  Biological Sciences of the National Science Foundation.  Each fellowship supports a research  and training plan to be carried out  in a sponsoring laboratory.  The  research and training plan for this  fellowship is entitled regulation  of gene expression in learning and  memory.  The overall objective is  to understand the biochemistry of  learning and memory, behaviors  crucial to all animals and an  important aspect of how organisms  interact with the environment.  Transcription is the first step in  gene expression and is the starting  point for this study.  Previous  studies on the role of  transcription in learning and  memory have relied on simple cell-  based systems where the interplay  between transcription and behavior  could not be studied.   This  research investigates how  transcription related to learning  and memory is regulated in a whole  organism, the fruit fly Drosophila.",
