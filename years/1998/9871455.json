Advances in the past decade have opened up the  possibility of understanding and designing materials at the  nanometer scale.  At the same time there have been  tremendous advances in computational algorithms and computer  architectures which make it possible to realistically study  these materials.    The specific study of magnetic nanoparticles and ultrathin  films is of importance for reliable ultrahigh-density  magnetic storage.  In this case a single bit of information  will be stored in a single-domain nanoscale magnetic  particle.  Consequently, it is vitally important to  understand the stability of these domains, their dynamical  properties, and their behavior at finite temperatures.  This  requires intensive large-scale numerical simulations of  realistic models of technologically important magnetic  materials.    This grant will develop novel algorithms for hysteresis and  thermally driven magnetizatin reversal models of nanoscale  ferromagnets.  The materials objective of this research will  be to improve our understanding of dynamical phenomena in  real ferromagnetic materials in restricted geometries at  nonzero temperatures.  The materials to be modeled include  ultrathin films, whiskers and nanometer-sized single-domain  particles.  The models to be used include the clock-and  continuum-spin models with finite spin anisotropy, effects  of magnetostatic interactions, systems with defects and  quenched disorder, models of ferrimagnets, and quantum spin  models.    To study these models, novel algorithms will be further  developed.  These include the Projective Dynamics and the  Monte Carlo with Absorbing Markov Chain algorithms.  It is  also proposed to initiate large-scale studies of continuum-  spin models using, and further developing, Langevin  micromagnetic methods f or finite-temperature simulations.    Successful completion of this research will lead to a better  understanding of the dynamics of magnetization switching in  real nanoscale magnetic materials.  The algorithms developed  should have broad application.  %%%  This is a theoretical and computational research grant which  aims to explore the properties of magnets on the nanometer  scale using high performance computers and state-of-the-art  algorithms.
