 "awd_abstract_narration": "IBN 98-15056 JOHNSON.  Compared to listening with one ear,  listening with two ears provides significant advantages to hearing  in quiet and noisy rooms.  Individuals who are deaf in one ear  perform significantly more poorly than normal listeners on tasks  such as locating sound sources and identifying spoken words  presented in noise.  Experiments have shown that differences  between the sounds at the two ears (i.e., interaural differences)  are used by our brains to provide this \"binaural\" advantage.  Two  important brain centers involved  in comparing these interaural  differences are the lateral superior olive (LSO) and the medial  nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB).  MNTB neurons provide the  LSO with information about sounds coming from one ear, while  cochlear nuclear neurons provide information about sounds coming  from the opposite ear.    The studies of Dr. Tsuchitani and her  collaborators have shown that LSO neurons use this information to  compute interaural differences in loudness (ILD) and time-varying  ILDs produced by the sound-shadowing effect of the head and ear.  Dr. Johnson and collaborators developed a computational model of  LSO neurons that permits simulation of LSO responses, and  statistical models that provide descriptions and predictions of  how the LSO system responds to different types of binaural  stimuli.    The studies to be undertaken will explore the role of the LSO and  MNTB in the neural processing of complex signals akin to those  encountered naturally by employing methods developed for virtual  acoustics. Transient complex stimuli will be used, presented alone  and in background noise.  The apparent location of the signal  source will be manipulated by applying cat head-related transfer  functions supplied by Dr. Joseph Hind and Dr. John Brugge of the  University of Wisconsin. Dr. Tsuchitani, an auditory  neurophysiologist, will conduct the experiments manipulating the  stimuli and recording the electrical responses of single and  multiple neurons in the  LSO and MNTB to these stimuli.  Dr.  Johnson, a communication/signal processing theorist, will be  applying advanced signal analysis techniques to the recorded data  to determine how the ensemble of LSO neurons responding to complex  stimuli processes binaural information.  This technique will be  used to determine what perceptual cues, ILD, time varying ILDs,  interaural time differences, and interaural spectral differences,  the LSO ensemble response provides.  The results of this project  will reveal how the brain uses interaural differences to produce  the binaural advantage in hearing in quiet and noisy rooms.",
