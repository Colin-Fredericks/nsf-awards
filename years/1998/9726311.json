 "awd_abstract_narration": "9726311  Lisy    This award supports a two year collaborative research  project between Professor James Lisy of the University of  Illinois in Chicago and Professor Tamotsu Kondow of the  Toyota Technological Institute in Chiba, Japan.  The  researchers will undertake a study on cluster structure,  motion and reaction dynamics.  They plan to characterize the  physical and chemical properties of a variety of small  molecular aggregates, or clusters, of known size and  composition.  The project capitalizes on the spectroscopic  techniques developed at Illinois, with the chemical reaction  dynamics methods from Japan, and would be extremely useful  in a systematic study of structure-reactivity correlations.  An important area of investigation involves the study of  molecules adsorbed on transition metal cluster ions, a model  for fundamentally and technologically significant catalytic  processes.    The project brings together the efforts of two major  laboratories that have constituted different parts of the  process.  The Americans have expertise in infrared studies  of a wide variety of gas-phase, mass-selected, solvated  metal ions, and are interested in extending the  spectroscopic studies of solvated cluster ions to include  more complex metal ions such as transition metals.  Japanese  expertise is in the area of metal cluster ion production and  they plan to develop a continuous source of transition metal  ion and cluster ions over the next two years.  Techniques  developed between the two groups should enhance the  likelihood of obtaining significant new results, over  isolated investigations by either group.  Through the  exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden  our base of basic knowledge and promote international  understanding and cooperation.  ***",
