A key component of the program will an Internet component with a web page that complements and supports the existing Dragonfly magazine and the Dragonfly pilot television program that is being produced under a separate grant.  The web page follows the same themes as the magazine and provides scientific information, an educational interactive experience, a sidebar of interesting information about topics, and advice about how users can investigate themes further themselves off-line.  Other Dragonfly Quest components will include a leader's guide for educators in informal settings, and educator's companion, a Dragonfly Pocket Field Book with challenges to engage youth in investigations in the field, and Dragonfly badges, certificates, and notebooks.    Dragonfly Quest clubs will be established at 200 Boys & Girls Clubs (B&GC) of America chapters nationwide.  The B&GC are making a major effort to see that their chapters having computer and Internet capabilities available to the participants.  Currently, approximately 40% of the 2000 chapters are linked to the Internet.  The chapters with computers selected for this project each will all have at least four computers for youth - all capable of running browser software at the level Netscape 3.0.  Assessment of the effectiveness of the project will be carried out at all 200 clubs.   Thhe evaluation will be conducted at 160 clubs with Internet access and 40 clubs without Internet access to evaluate the added-value component of the web pages relative to the other elements of the Dragonfly Quest package.",
