 "awd_abstract_narration": "9810773  Diehl    This grant provides partial support of the costs of acquiring a  superconducting rock magnetometer (SRM) and field-free room for  the paleomagnetics laboratory at Michigan Technological  University (MTU).  The SRM will replace their present spinner  magnetometer that is besieged with problems and cannot be used to  reliably measure weakly  magnetized samples.  The field free room  will optimize the performance of the SRM while eliminating the  acquisition of laboratory-induced viscous magnetization during  storage and transfer of the samples.  The addition of a SRM at  MTU will allow rapid analyses of weakly magnetized sediments as  well as more strongly magnetized igneous rocks.  Some of the  current projects that will benefit from the acquisition of the  SRM include: (1) studies of the magnetic properties of volcanic  ash as an aid in tephra correlation and as indicators of  atmospheric fractionation, (2) the reconstruction of upper  Pleistocene and Holocene paleoenvironments from cave sediments in  the Moravian Karst, Czech Republic and, (3) investigations into  the rates of movement along the Hilina Fault System on south  flank of Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii.  Future projects that will be  made possible with the acquisition of the SRM include the  following: (1) an investigation into the timing of the  unconformity that separates Permian rocks from Triassic rocks in  southwestern Utah, (2) investigations into regional climate  changes since the last glaciation derived from magnetic  properties of lake cores from the Keweenaw Peninsula, and (3)  historical studies of the Keweenaw current based on secular  variation and correlation of Lake Superior sediments.  ***",
