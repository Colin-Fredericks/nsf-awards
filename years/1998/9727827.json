 "awd_abstract_narration": "Visscher    9727827        Terrestrial ecosystems are dominated by social species. Social  cooperation among conspecifics was a major evolutionary innovation that  occurred repeatedly in diverse taxa. The study of social insects has  provided unparalleled insights concerning both the evolution of sociality  and the behavioral mechanisms involved. Similarly the study of social  insects has contributed broadly to many fields of scientific inquiry. The  most important international organization of social insect scientists is  the International Union for the Study of Social Insects (IUSSI). This group  holds the only international congress devoted to research on social insects  every four years. Funds are requested here so that students, postdocs, and  early career social insect scientists from the United States can travel to  the 13th International Congress of the IUSSI to be held in Adelaide,  Australia, from 19 Dec. 1998- 4 Jan. 1999.    Typically, IUSSI Congresses attract scientists from over 30 countries  and cover a wide range of disciplines including genetics, physiology,  behavior, population biology, ecology, evolution, and systematics. Largely  due to previous NSF funding, members of the North American Section  (NAS/IUSSI) presented 25% or more of the program in the three most recent  meetings (Munich, Germany 1986; Bangalore, India 1990; and Paris, France  1994). In turn, American social insect scientists substantially benefited  from this involvement.    Because this multidisciplinary Congress is the primary international  forum for discussion of new information regarding social insects, it is  essential that researchers and students from the United Stated attend this  meeting. Moreover, this congress will provide North American scientists the  opportunity to open new dialogues with overseas colleagues and initiate  plans for collaborative research. Funds are requested to insure that  American researchers are able to participate in this very significant  congress.    1",
