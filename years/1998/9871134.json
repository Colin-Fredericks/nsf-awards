 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities   Program and the Major Research Instrumentation Program will enable the   faculty in the Department of Chemistry at The University of North Dakota   to acquire a 400 MHz NMR Spectrometer. This equipment will enhance   research in a variety of different areas of chemistry, including organic,   bioorganic, synthetic carbohydrate, inorganic, and analytical chemistry.    The instrumentation will be used in several research projects, such as,   studies of carcinogen-DNA interactions, stereoselective synthesis of   disaccharides and related compounds, reactions of early/late transition   metal dimers with organosulfur compounds, electron transfer reactions,   and others.  The NMR spectrometer will also be available for teaching   graduate and undergraduate students to obtain and interpret the kinds of   spectra (2D) that are unavailable with the current instrumentation.    Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is the most powerful tool   available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules.   It is used to identify unknown substances, characterize specific   arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of   interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art   NMR spectrometry is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier   research. The results from these NMR studies are useful in the areas such   as synthetic chemistry, catalysis, and in biology.",
