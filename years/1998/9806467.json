The  conference is organized jointly by the Chinese Society for  Metals, Japan Institute of Metals, The Korean Institute of  Metals and Materials, and The Minerals, Metals and Materials  Society of the United States.  The Pacific Rim International  Conference is held every three years and is rotated among  the four organizing societies.  The first conference was  held in Hangzhou, China, June 1992.  The second conference  was held in Kyonju, South Korea, June 1995.  The objective  of this third conference, PRICM 3, is to provide a forum for  the exchange of technical information on materials  processing and characterization with a focus on electronic,  magnetic and optical materials, structural materials, and  functional materials.  Over 500 presentations are planned in  addition to poster sessions.  %%%  The conference explores advances in science and technology  in materials areas of significant value to industry,  including, advanced ferrous alloys, intermetallic alloys,  magnetic alloys, rapid prototyping, spray forming, smart  materials, and diamond film growth.  ***",
