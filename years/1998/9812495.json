Klinzing, U. of Pittsburgh    Travel support for 15 young researchers (mostly Ph.D. students) and an advisor has been awarded for an intensive short course on particle technology at the  University of Clausthal under the direction of Prof. K. Leschonski.  The course will be held in a laboratory uniquely equipped with facilities to successively simple phenomena, operation of devices, and particle handling systems.  The program will have duration of one week during June 1998 and will intensely expose and teach students though a rigorous and innovative series of experiments that Prof. Leschonski has developed over the years.  The students have been selected by open competition from a wide variety of colleges and universities through a selection process that required a letter of recommendation from the student advisor.  Particle technology education has a rich tradition in Germany, and this short course will help dissemination of the basic concepts and system analysis to a divers group of future experts in particle technology in U.S.  ***",
