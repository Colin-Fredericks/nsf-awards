The co-organizers are Professors Russell Jones of the  University of California at Berkeley and Kenzo Nakamura of  Nagoya University in Japan.  The seminar will focus on the  biogenesis, structure and function of vacuoles.  It will  bring together biochemists, and cell and molecular  biologists who work with vacuoles.  The emphasis will be on  vacuoles in higher plants but vacuoles in baker's yeast will  also be discussed.    Research on biochemistry, and cell and molecular biology of  vacuoles is presently very dynamic.  Researchers are  beginning to understand the complexities surrounding the  biogenesis of vacuoles in plants and yeast and the  mechanisms of targeting macromolecules to this compartment.  Rapid progress is also being made in identifying and  characterizing tonoplast transporters.  New pumps and  channels on the tonoplast are being described, and the role  of these transport molecules in cellular homeostasis is  beginning to be understood.  It is anticipated that the  researchers will be able to discuss and resolve current  controversy and disagreement about many aspects of vacuole  structure and function.  Seminar organizers have made a  special effort to involve younger researchers.  The exchange  of ideas and data with Japanese experts in this field will  enable U.S. participants to advance their own work, and will  set the stage for future collaborative projects.  ***",
