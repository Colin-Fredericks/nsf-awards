 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: The project continues an ongoing program, the aim of which is to \r\nestablish a workable theory for orthogonal polynomials (OP) in several \r\nvariables and use the knowledge to construct cubature formulae (CF), synonym \r\nfor higher dimensional numerical integration formulae. A general framework \r\nhas been developed by the P.I. in the first phase of this program, including \r\nan extensive theory of OP in several variables based on a new vector-matrix \r\nnotation and a systematic study of the relation between CF and the common \r\nzeros of (quasi-)OP. The main focus of this project is on OP and CF on the\r\nunit sphere, on the unit ball and on the standard simplex of the Euclidean \r\nspace. The starting point is a recent observation made by the P.I. that \r\northogonal structures on these domains are closely related, which has led to \r\nnew understanding about OP on these classical domains and to a powerful new \r\nmethod for constructing CF. Special attention will be given to the structure \r\nof OP and CF that are invariant under certain groups, such as octahedral group\r\nor symmetric group of the simplex, which has a close relation to the recent \r\ndevelopment of h-harmonics associated to the reflection groups. \r\n\r\nCubature formulae and orthogonal polynomials in several variables have\r\nfruitful connections with many branches of applied mathematics such as \r\nnumerical integration, approximation, coding theory, data fitting, numerical\r\nsolution of differential equation, finite element methods to name a few. CF \r\nitself is essential for practical evaluation of high dimensional integrals, \r\nwhich is one of the basic questions in numerical analysis and is often taken \r\nas a test problem in high speed computing. The present project seeks new \r\nunderstanding of the nature of CF and OP in several variables. Its aim is to \r\ndetermine the precise relationship between orthogonal structures on the sphere,\r\nthe ball, and the simplex, especially analytic relations which will lead to new \r\nprogress on convergence of the orthogonal expansion, and to develop practical\r\nmethod that will yield new effective numerical integration formulae on these \r\ndomains, especially on the unit sphere. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
