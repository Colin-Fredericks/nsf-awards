 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to provide a foundation for applying machine learning in practice.  The research   component has two goals. Firstly, to develop data collection and refinement methods that allow machine   learning algorithm to extract structure from data.  Secondly, to perform empirical and theoretical analyses   of machine learning algorithms to develop a deeper understanding of current and new methods, and to   uncover the characteristics of datasets that make them amenable to particular learning algorithms. The   education component of this project aims to provide practitioners with the foundation required to apply   machine learning successfully in practice by providing a deeper understanding of the type of structure that   various learning algorithms can detect, by creating tools for collecting data, by giving students hands on   experience applying machine learning in practice, and through inter-disciplinary research projects.  These   research and education activities are being performed in the context of several application domains,   including mapping global land cover of the Earth from remotely sensed data, content-based image   retrieval of high resolution CAT scans of the lung, learning to detect anomalies for computer security, and   on-board processing of planetary data.  In addition to its contribution to applied machine learning, this   project has the benefit that the successful application of machine learning to proposed application domains   will result in non-trivial contributions to medicine, computer systems development, and geography.  http://mow.ecn.purdue.edu/ brodley/",
