 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year award supports US-France cooperative research aimed at the design of   control laws for nonholonomic robot systems.  Nonholonomic systems are mechanical   systems with motion constraints.  The collaboration involves Panagiotis Tsiotras of the   University of Virginia and the research group led by Carlos A. Canudas de Wit at the   Automation Laboratory of the Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Ingenieurs Electriciens in   Grenoble, France.  The investigators will develop a methodology for constructing non-  smooth, time-invariant, feedback control laws for special classes of nonholonomic   systems, which include the case of mobile robots.  Implementation of the control laws via   force or torque actuators and robustness to external disturbances will be examined.  The   controls will then be experimentally tested and compared to other methods using mobile   robots at the University of Virginia and at the Automation Laboratory in Grenoble.  The US investigator brings to this collaboration expertise in stabilization and control of   rigid bodies.  This is complemented by the French investigator's expertise in nonlinear   control theory and control of nonholonomic systems.  The project will advance knowledge   of new nonlinear algorithms for nonholonomic systems with fast convergence rates and   could be applied to autonomous or semi-autonomous mobile robots and underactuated   mechanical systems.",
