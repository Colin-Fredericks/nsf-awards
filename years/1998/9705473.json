The  first  step is to identify the symmetry  of  the  order  parameter and we focus first on Upt3, which is arguably  the  prototype  unconventional heavy fermion superconductor.   In  order  to determine the pairing state in Upt3 we propose  to  make  single crystals with a range of impurities and measure  the   impurity   dependence  of  the  physical   properties,  including  the thermal conductivity, specific heat  and  the  phase  diagram.  In order to identify the spin structure  of  the pairing state, we will measure NMR knight shifts and the  upper critical fields and compare with calculations that are  sensitive   to  surface  scattering  and  strong  spin-orbit  interactions.  We will perform measurements of magnetization  and  magnetoresistance and, with our collaborators at  other  institutions, we will investigate further the magnetic phase  diagram  using  neutron and magnetic X-ray  scattering.   We  will compare these results with calculations of impurity and  defect  scattering  on  the  physical  properties  for   the  principal  candidate  ground  states.   The  low-temperature  transport   coefficients,  eg.  thermal  conductivity,   are  important  because  they reflect the low  enrgy  excitations  associated  with  the nodes of  the gap.   We  believe  that  transport measurements on high quality single crystals, such  as  we  are able to grow, will be decisive in resolving  the  orbital  symmetry  of  the pairing state  in  heavy  fermion  superconductors, e.g. Upt3.  %%%  It  is  proposed  to  solve key problems  in  heavy  fermion  superconductivity  with  initial  focus  on  the   important  compound  Upt3.   The  results of this  research  will  have  impact  on  understanding  of  superconductivity  in   other  correlated fermion superconductors, notably high temperature  superconductors.    That  superconductivity   in   Up t3   is  unconventional, is evident in its complex phase diagram  and  the  power  laws  that  are  exhibited  in  the  temperature  dependence   of  thermodynamic  and  transport   properties,  particularly  at  low temperatures.  Yet it is not yet known  which  of  a  number  of  likely  possible  candidates   for  superconducting pairing state is the appropriate  model  for  Upt3.   Separating intrinsic and extrinsic behavior  is  the  key   to  solving  this  problem  and  is  a  challenge  for  experimental  and  theoretical condensed matter  physics  in  concert    with   a   materials   program.    Growing    and  characterizing   the   purest,  most  defect-free   crystals  possible  is  essential to the success of research  in  this  field  and  we  have developed facilities for this  purpose.  Interest  has been expressed from an international group  of  scientists  to  collaborate  with  us,  working   with   the  materials produced in these facilities.  The  proposed  work  draws  together  four  principal  investigators,  Professors  Bedzyk, Halperin, Sauls and Seidman from two departments  at  Northwestern University:  Materials Science and  Engineering  and Physics and Astronomy.  These researchers have expertise  in  materials  science, crystal growth and characterization,  experimental   low  temperature  physics,  and   theoretical  physics     of     correlated    electron    systems     and  superconductivity.   The expertise of the  members  of  this  group is at the forefront of their respective disciplines.  ***",
