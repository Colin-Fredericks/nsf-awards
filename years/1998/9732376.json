 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with the design of computational algorithms  that blend together the practical virtues of efficiency and  numerical accuracy for matrix problems with structure.  The two  requirements of speed and accuracy have often been regarded as  competitive and, for this reason, the design of fast and  numerically reliable algorithms for large-scale structured linear  matrix equations has remained a significant open issue in many  instances.    Structured matrix equations arise in several applications in the  disciplines of filtering, estimation, and control.  In this way,  the results of the proposed work will further play a concrete  role in addressing some of the annoying discrepancies that have  always existed in these areas between the theoretical findings  and the practical results.  These discrepancies are often due to  the pitfalls of finite-precision implementations, especially in  systems that involve interconnections of digital and analog  components, and studies to resolve or ameliorate many of these  difficulties have long been overdue.    This investigation will address the challenge of combining  numerical accuracy and structure exploiting techniques into a  unifying framework.  The project will build on the work recently  done, will extend the results and the framework to a wider  class of structured matrix problems, and will explore  applications in filtering, estimation and control.",
