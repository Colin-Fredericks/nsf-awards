 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this proposal is for the Principal\r\nInvestigator to acquire a thorough background in the techniques\r\nof molecular biology, both theoretical and experimental, and\r\nexposure to contemporary research in the modeling of long-strand\r\nbiological molecules from chemical, physical, and mathematical\r\nperspectives, in order to bring to fruition a research program\r\nthat will develop and apply techniques of knot theory to obtain\r\nnew understanding of the dynamics of DNA, RNA and polymeric\r\nproteins.  In addition, this proposal will lead to the\r\ndevelopment and implementation of model graduate programs in\r\nbiomathematics.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator will serve as a visiting faculty\r\nmember in the Department of Biomathematics at Mount Sinai School\r\nof Medicine from July 1, 1998 to June 30, 1999.  This experience\r\nwill shape the PI's research program in mathematics and its\r\napplications during the grant period and in subsequent years. \r\nThe modeling of the relationship between the structure and\r\nfunction in DNA and other biological molecules is an area of\r\nincreasing importance and one that has many unexplored facets. \r\nThe vast storehouse of DNA sequence data currently being\r\ngenerated will only become useful when the dynamics of its\r\nmolecular function are understood.  Knot theory has already\r\nemerged as an important descriptive and foundational language for\r\ndeveloping models of molecular function.  The application to\r\nthese problems of new techniques of knot theory has the potential\r\nto revolutionize our understanding of molecular biology by\r\nenabling the development of the kind of valid and complete\r\ndescriptions of molecular dynamics that are required for the\r\naccurate prediction of structure and function.\r\n\r\nThe expertise that the PI will obtain will also enrich the\r\neducational experiences and broaden the career options for\r\nstudents in his subsequent academic endeavors.  The PI will\r\nengage in interdisciplinary interactions with students and\r\nfaculty in the biological sciences and will work to implement\r\ngraduate programs in biomathematics.  Graduates of such programs,\r\nboth at the master's and doctoral levels will enjoy excellent\r\nemployment opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry.\r\n\r\nThis IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of\r\nMultidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of\r\nMathematical Sciences (DMS).\r\n",
