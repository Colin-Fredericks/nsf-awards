There are however other natural distances which a \r\nmathematician encounters.  For example the \"taxicab distance\" between \r\ntwo points on this surface would be the distance between the points as \r\nmeasured by a taxi that could only travel horizontally or vertically \r\n(imagine all roads run N-S or E-W).  Mathematicians must study the \r\ngeometry of these different notions of distance in order to solve those \r\nproblems from whence the geometry arose.  Furthermore many mathematical \r\nproblems require one to work in spaces of higher than three dimensions, \r\neven infinite dimensional space (for example in quantum mechanics \r\ndifferential equations,...).  This project concerns such problems.  \r\nFor example the author and Th. Schlumprecht proved that ordinary \r\n(tape measure) infinite dimensional space could have its geometry \r\naltered (\"distorted\") so as to be that one could not recapture the \r\noriginal geometry up to any given multiple in any infinite dimensional \r\n\"slice\".  This is false for the taxicab geometry. But it remains a famous \r\nopen problem as to whether or not there exists a geometry which can be \r\naltered but not too badly.  Other problems of this project involve \r\ndetermining infinite dimensional substructures of a geometry given limited \r\n\"asymptotical\" (less than infinite dimensional but more than finite \r\ndimensional) information. \r\n",
