 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to develop a simultaneous two-photon excitation  and confocal laser          scanning microscope optimized for multi-color fluorescence imaging  of living cells and          tissues. Over the last decade, it has become apparent that the cell  cannot be regarded as          a 'bag of chemicals' that carries out biological reactions. The  exact three-dimensional          arrangement of the cellular components is tremendously important,  as are the time-dependent          changes in this arrangement during the cell cycle and upon  interaction with a variety of cell activators          (neurotransmitters, hormones, growth factors, etc.). Recent advances,          such as two-photon excitation microscopy and the Green Fluorescent          Protein (GFP), now allow high resolution imaging of living cells with minimal effects on cell viability.  Considerable eff          ort has been devoted over the last five years to develop          quantitative laser scanning microscopies (imaging of NAD(P)H, Indo-          1, and GFP by          two-photon excitation, and imaging of GFP mutants by confocal          microscopy), and now have          determined optimal parameters for each of these imaging modes.          However, to understand the          relationships between cellular arrangement, dynamics, and function,          it is necessary to          examine individual cells from multiple perspectives. Multi-          parameter imaging of living.          cells has been used effectively with widefield microscopy. For          imaging of thick tissues,          though, an optical sectioning microscopy, such as confocal or two-          photon excitation, is          needed.          The proposed instrument will be built around a Zeiss LSM510          confocal microscope,          added with lasers for two-photon excitation and optimized          excitation of GFP mutants.  A non-descanned detection channel will          be installed for optimized detection of two-photon excited           fluorescence.  Installation of this detector will permit testing          true photon counting electronics and different detectors, such as a          cooled PMT or avalanche photodiode. This new instrument will allow          researchers to combine multiple imaging modes that they have          optimized separately. As an example, they can use two-photon          excitation imaging to  monitor cellular metabolic activity (by NAD(P)H autofluorescence)          and confocal imaging to GEP fusion proteins to study specific          protein translocations that may affect metabolism.     Currently,          these two experiments must be done on two separate instruments          which prohibits direct correlations at the single cell level. With          the proposed instrument, such experiments can he performed on the          same cell at the same time by confocal imaging of GFP and two-          photon excitation imaging of NAD(P)H.  An alternative imaging          method is the use of two-photon excitation to image both GFP and          NAD(P)H by utilizing dual emission filters to          measure each flluorophore simultaneously. The new instrument will          work in either          configuration, and can thus be used to rapidly determine the          preferable method for each          application.               Once this instrument is developed and tested, it will become          part of the Vanderbilt          University Cell Imaging Resource. The resource has three staff          members, and is currently          used by more than 70 labs from the medical center and 4 from other          campus units. It          contains two microscopes, a confocal laser scanning microscope and          a conventional          fluorescence microscope with an ultralow light level CCD camera,          plus several computers          for data analysis and high quality image output. Inclusion of this          new microscope in the          imaging resource will allow its efficient administration,           facilitate the transfer of new          developments to a large number of researchers, and create a unique,          full-service resource          dedicated to live cell imaging.",
