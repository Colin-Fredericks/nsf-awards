 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the project is to document and compare 30  individual case studies of initial acquisition of sign language in  Dutch deaf children in the age range from 15 to 36 months. The data  consist of longitudinal video recordings made in home and preschool  settings, vocabulary checklists gathered from parents, and scales  of motor and cognitive development. Two samples of deaf children of  hearing parents are compared: 13 using a natural sign language  (SLN: Sign Language of the Netherlands) and 13 using a nonnatural  sign system (SSD: Sign Supported Dutch). In both samples, the  parents began to learn a manual language before the child was old  enough to begin linguistic communication. A control group of four  children learned SLN from deaf parents.       The video recordings will be transcribed and coded on a  number of linguistic, gestural, and communicative dimensions.  Transcription and coding will include the communicative behavior  of children, parents, and preschool teachers. Quantitative and  qualitative analyses will be carried out, relating coded  dimensions with each other, with measures of vocabulary and  nonlinguistic performance, and with types of parental input.  Developmental patterns will be established for each type of  input.       Four major predictions are made: (1) Adequate sign language  development is possible with \"imperfect input\" from hearing  parents provided the input is a natural sign language (SLN). (2)  SLN is a natural language, and is acquired in similar fashion to  other natural languages spoken and signed. (3) SSD does not provide  sufficient input for adequate primary language acquisition. (4) A  natural sign language (SLN) can successfully function as a second  language for hearing parents in interacting with a deaf child.  (Findings with regard to SLN, in the age range considered, are  expected to closely match findings with regard to American Sign  Language.)       Confirmation of these predictions would argue for early  intervention programs in w hich hearing parents are taught a  natural sign language, such as SLN or ASL, in order to establish  normal language and communicative development in a deaf child. It  is expected that the study will lead to new insights into the  linguistic structure of SLN and other natural sign languages with  consequences for linguistic theory and for the assessment and  education of deaf children. Implications will be drawn for  theories of child language acquisition, including the cognitive,  communicative, and biological foundations of human language. The  findings and implications will be of immediate relevance to deaf  children and their families in the United States, as well as the  Netherlands and other countries.",
