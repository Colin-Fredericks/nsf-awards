 "awd_abstract_narration": "O'Dell   9732702  The goals of this project are three-fold: To develop a mathematical framework and computer software for representing and solving differential equation models of gene networks, to assemble a minimal model of the segment polarity gene network of Drosophila melanogaster and to test and refine that model against results in the literature and laboratory experiments, adding components to the model as necessary.    Molecular genetics has produced a growing wealth of data on a host of functionally important genes. These data present both an opportunity and a serious challenge to biologists seeking to explain developmental mechanisms. Most, and maybe all, developmentally important genes act within dynamic networks whose essential behaviors are determined by complex webs of interaction among their constituents. Because of their dynamic nature, these essential behaviors cannot be directly inferred from the simple arrow diagrams that biologists typically use to summarize their experiments. The resolution of the actual dynamic interactions occurring simultaneously within even very small networks into accurate predictions of overall network behavior is not possible without the use of computer tools. Thus, computer models offer a powerful and unique approach to analyzing the behavior of such complex dynamic networks. The goal of this proposal is to develop and illustrate a general computer modeling approach that can be generally used to study gene networks in many different contexts. The basis of this approach is to formulate equations describing how the concentration of each network constituent varies continuously in time as a function of its interactions within the network, and then use them to explore the network's behavior. The segment polarity gene network in Drosophila which establishes patterned cell fates across the cellular blastoderm will be used as a model.",
