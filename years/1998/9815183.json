 "awd_abstract_narration": "98-15183  Purdy    The Triangle Coalition manages the Albert Einstein Distinguished Educator Fellowships Program to give highly qualified K-12 matheamtics and science teachers an opportunity to spend a school year in the Washington, DC metropolitan are to serve as a \"teacher voice\" with various federal agencies and Congress.  Recently, federal agencies such as NASA, the US Department of Education, the US Department of Energy, and the National Institutes of Health have hosted Einstein Fellows.  During the 1997-1998 school year, NSF hosted a fellow.  While in the agencies, teachers have worked on several initiatives of national importance such as follow-up to the third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), and the Presidential Awards Program of NSF.  In addition to serving in federal agencies, Fellows engage in ongoing seminars and programs, managed by the Triangle Coalition, throughout their time in Washington.      To become an Einstein Fellow, teachers submit a written application and then undergo an interview process in Washington.  The interview panel is composed of current fellows and representatives of federal agencies.  Those selected as finalists are then placed.  This project will place a former Presidential Awardee as an Einstein Fellow at the National Science Foundation, to work on the Presidential Awards Program, and other teacher enhancement efforts.",
