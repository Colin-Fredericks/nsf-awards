 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is on interconnect design in submicron  technologies, with the goal of developing a logic synthesis  methodology which would produce highly regular layout  structures without large area penalty. Research issues being  explored include: the relationship between circuit structure  and its incremental restructurability; achieving a network  of given properties through a sequence of incremental  changes; simultaneous switching and cross-talk noise effects  in RC interconnects; accurate, easy to compute bounds on  crosstalk amplitude and duration; modeling the influence of  crosstalk on delay; design optimization techniques for  minimizing crosstalk effects in synthesis; and modeling of  low-level effects which can be corrected at the routing/wire  sizing and/or transistor sizing steps. The project is also  developing a methodology to determine crosstalk budgets  based on circuit structure, as well as transistor and wire  sizing tools which will consider both crosstalk and delay.  Techniques for buffer insertion and spacing, net reordering,  and Boolean level regularity are also being investigated.",
