Page, Jr.    Non-Technical Summary    Honeybee colonies are normally composed of a queen and  thousands of non-reproductive workers.  The workers  demonstrate a division of labor for behavioral tasks  resulting in the survival, maintenance, and reproduction of  the colony.  One of the most interesting examples is the  division of labor between workers inside the nest raising  brood, constructing wax comb, processing honey, etc. and  those that forage outside the nest.  This division of tasks  is often related to a worker's age.  Some foragers  specialize further in collecting nectar and others in  collecting only pollen.  Honeybee colonies must respond to  changing conditions in the environment, such as the  availability of food, and they must respond to changes in  colony needs, such as the amount of pollen protein needed to  feed a growing colony.  Genetic make up is also important.  Bees with some genetic constitutions are more likely to  forage for pollen under a specific set of environmental  conditions than are individuals of a different genotype.  Building on previous research, this project will employ  molecular genetic methodology to examine the influence of  identified genes on foraging specialization, and to  comprehensively examine how the influences of these genes  interact with developmental (age) effects and environmental  conditions.",
