 "awd_abstract_narration": "9713569  McDowell    To refine the vision of Materials Design Science and  Engineering   (MDS&E), develop a common understanding of its  fullness, and chart out a conceptual roadmap necessary to  pursue it within the broad materials education and research  community, the Materials Council of the Georgia Institute of  Technology, in collaboration with the materials faculty at  Morehouse College, will hold a workshop in the fall of 1998  in Atlanta .   The primary objectives of the workshop are to  identify the critical issues and potential impact of MDS&E  on the nationOs educational and research enterprise, both  obstacles and opportunities, and to identify specific areas  for follow-on workshops.  The workshop engages keynote  speakers and panel discussions in each of four themes:  Structure-Property Relations across Length Scales, Materials  Synthesis and Design, Elements of Process Design Science and  Engineering, and Multidisciplinary Materials Education.  The  distinguished speakers and panelists in each theme are drawn  from a broad range of science and engineering disciplines.  A report outlining a refined vision of MDS&E that identifies  key challenges and opportunities will result from the  workshop.  This grant is funded by the Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and  Physical Sciences  Directorate.  %%%  The workshop contributes to the directions that should be  taken in future materials research and development by  examining anticipated needs and impact in the field.",
