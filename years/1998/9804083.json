Three  classical  problems are addressed: 1) commensurate and incommensurate phases  and  phase transitions, 2) stability of topological order  of  an  elastic  lattice in a random pinning potential, 3) effects  of  a  Peierls-Nabarro  potential  on  edge  dislocations  and   melting  kinetics. These problems are encountered in surface science, self-  assembled  nanostructure  materials,  low  dimensional   electron  systems,  disordered superconductors, micromechanics  of  solids,  and  fundamental  studies  of  statistical  mechanics.  Colloidal  suspensions  are  the  media for the present  study.  Experiments  employ  digital  video microscopy, in combination  with  advanced  optical tweezers technology, to study the statics and dynamics of  colloidal  particles confined between two glass  slides.  On  the  glass  slides,  a mesoscopic structure which acts as  a  quenched  periodic  or random pinning potential for the colloidal particles  will  be  made using lithographic techniques. An optical  tweezer  will  be  used  to study the elastic and plastic responses  of  a  colloidal  crystal  to a local distortion. The proposed  research  will  benefit the undergraduate physics program, and will  expose  students  to advanced microfabrication technology, optics,  image  analysis  and condensed matter physics. This research program  is  interdisciplinary  in nature and involves students,  who  receive  excellent  training  in  preparation  for  careers  in  industry,  government laboratories or academia.  %%%  This  experimental research project focuses on  basic  mechanical  properties  of two-dimensionsal elastic crystals. Two-dimensional  crystals are ordered arrays, with some similarity to an array  of  marbles  on a Chinese checker board, or a bedspring. The sort  of  question is what happens t o the overall array if one or a few  of  the  objects are pushed; does the array smoothly distort or  does  it  come  apart. A related question is the response  if,  in  the  presence  of  a  uniform external force, a few locations  of  the  lattice are pinned down. Does the array continue to move, does it  stop  (pinned), or does it break up. The experiments in this work  actually  will  be done on colloidal crystals, which  are  weakly  bound  ordered arrays of molecules. These crystals are relatively  easy  to  deal  with  experimentally because  the  intermolecular  forces  are  weak  and  the molecules are relatively  large.  The  results  on such a model system are expected to be applicable  to  many other situations. In the present work on colloidal crystals,  three  classical  problems  are addressed:  1)  commensurate  and  incommensurate  phases  and phase transitions,  2)  stability  of  topological  order  of an elastic lattice  in  a  random  pinning  potential,  3)  effects of a Peierls-Nabarro  potential  on  edge  dislocations and melting kinetics.
