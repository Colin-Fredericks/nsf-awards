 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870270  To test a piece of software, a set of possible inputs is  selected, the software is executed on each of them, and the  results are checked against the specification. This research  addresses the following two issues involving the development of  cost-effective testing techniques: evaluation of the  effectiveness of existing testing techniques and development of  efficient methods for checking test results against their  specifications. The first provides data to help practitioners  make informed choices between competing testing techniques; the  second lowers the cost of testing certain types of programs,  allowing more thorough testing within a given budget. The  research on evaluation of cost-effectiveness of testing  techniques is based on a probabilistic approach, since most  testing techniques involve some random choice among alternatives.  Models of cost are incorporated into several probabilistic  measures of effectiveness. The work on checking test results  focuses on testing data abstractions, an increasingly important  kind of program unit. New techniques for partially checking test  results are developed and their effectiveness is investigated  analytically and through  experimentation.***",
