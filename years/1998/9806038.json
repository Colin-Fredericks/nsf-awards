Male crickets  (Gryllus integer) call from hiding places to attract  females.  However, calling is dangerous because calls also  attract predators.  Female crickets prefer males with long  calls, and call duration is inherited. Bout lengths will be  measured as males call undisturbed. Predator-avoidance  behavior will be measured as the time taken by a male to  emerge from shelter in an unfamiliar environment.  If mating  behavior and antipredator behavior are geneticly linked,  males with longer bouts will compensate for their  conspicuous calls by being more cautious, i.e. emerging from  shelter more slowly.  To test whether females with strong  preferences for long calls are also cautious, a tracking  device will be built to measure the female's movement as she  runs towards calling males.  This device will allow precise  measures of each females' preferences and the preferences  will be compared with the time she takes to emerge from  shelter.      This study investigates the interplay of the two basic  forces in evolution, finding a mate and surviving.  By  examining the links between well defined, inherited aspects  of mating behavior and predator avoidance the research will  focus on the evolutionary balance between these two forces.  This will provide important insights and the results will be  widely applicable to all species where mating involves  conspicuous displays.",
