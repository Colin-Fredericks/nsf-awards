 "awd_abstract_narration": "John Cable of Bowling Green State University is supported by the   Experimental Physical Chemistry Program to investigate hydrogen bonding   in 1:1 clusters formed between various aromatic molecules and either   water or ammonia.  These studies concentrate on conformationally flexible   molecules; by varying the aromatic moiety,  effects of steric hindrance   and structural distortion on the hydrogen bonding interaction will be   examined.  Mass-selected resonance enhanced ionization spectroscopy and   dispersed fluorescence of the cluster expanded in a supersonic nozzle   will be used to yield  information on the excited and ground electronic   states, respectively.  A related theoretical effort involves simulations   of the observed energy levels of isolated and clustered solutes for   chararacterization of the detailed structural perturbations resulting   from hydrogen bonding.  The results of these investigations will provide   a more detailed understanding of the factors that affect the strength of   a hydrogen bond and how the electronic properties of a conjugated solute   molecule can be modulated by structural distortion in order to optimize   the hydrogen bonding interaction.  Hydrogen bonding plays an important role in chemistry, from strongly   influencing the physical properties of solvents to determining the   structures of biological macromolecules.  Although much weaker than   ordinary covalent and ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds are of crucial   importance to the molecular recognition processes that are significant in   biological systems.  These studies will improve the understanding of the   common types of hydrogen bonds that are relevant to proteins and nucleic   acids.",
