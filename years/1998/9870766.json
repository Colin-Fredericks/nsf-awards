 "awd_abstract_narration": "9870766  Richman             Self-recognition systems including the immune system in vertebrates  and the self-incompatibility locus in flowering plants exhibit spectacular   genetic polymorphism maintained by selection. The proposed work will test   recent models of self-recognition genes which predict that more distantly   related alleles will be favored by selection. This prediction will be   examined in island populations of both animals and plants which have   undergone a dramatic reduction in population size following isolation of   islands from the mainland due to post-Pleistocene sea level rise. The   premise for studying island populations is that non-random loss of alleles   will be most evident when the strength of diversifying selection is   reduced, as expected for newly isolated populations which will lose genetic   variation over time. If relatively distantly related alleles are favored   during subsequent reduction in allelic variation, this will be detected by   comparison of allelic genealogies for island and mainland populations.   If more divergent alleles are favored by selection this has  implications for both models of the evolution of the immune system and   recognition of disease antigens, and for evolutionary studies which attempt   to infer the history of populations from the diversity of self-recognition   genes. For example, preservation of divergent alleles by selection supports   models of the immune system that predict more divergent alleles are able to   present a wider variety of potential disease antigens to the immune system,   conferring enhanced resistance to the host. This result would also have   important implications for recent studies of self-recognition genes in   humans which conclude that population size has been large over the history   of diversification of the primate lineage. If more divergent allelic   specificities are preferentially maintained, these studies will tend to   overestimate the size of populations. Since these estimates are present ed as   lower limits on population effective size, this potential bias may   substantially alter the conclusions reached.",
