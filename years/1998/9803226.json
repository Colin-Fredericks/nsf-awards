These technologies  have had an enormous impact, primarily because electronic  representations can be used in ways the original physical objects  cannot. For example, they can be stored in, searched for, and  retrieved from databases, transmitted electronically over long  distances, manipulated and edited in software, and used as templates  for making electronic or physical copies.  Research in 3D scanning  promises to have a similar impact on a number of areas, including  the Federal Strategic Areas of high performance communication, civil  infrastructure, and manufacturing, as well as virtual museums,  entertainment, and product marketing.    This research group and others have made significant progress in  capturing, modeling, and displaying geometric shape.  The task of   acquiring and computing surface properties such as appearance,   however, has received far less attention.  The research effort in this   project focuses on three aspects of the problem: (i) texturing, bump   mapping and selective refinement of multiresolution meshes, (ii)   capturing, modeling and displaying radiance (color as a function of   position and direction), and (iii) generally estimating functions over   surfaces.",
