The viruses to be studied include two tobamoviruses, odontoglossum ringspot virus (ORSV) and sunn-hemp mosaic virus (SHMV), and members of the furovirus, potexvirus, and potyvirus groups.  Structures of the tobamoviruses will be determined by molecular replacement, using the known structure of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV).  The other structures will be determined de novo, using methods developed in P.I.'s laboratory.  All structures will be refined using molecular dynamics methods, as adapted in P.I.'s laboratory for use with fiber diffraction data.  The structures to be determined will be important in understanding the molecular characteristics of viruses, and will advance understanding of viral assembly and disassembly, viral-host interactions and specificity, and vector transmission, as well as the relationship between structure and the rapid evolution of RNA viruses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe structures of a number of filamentous plant viruses will be determined using fiber diffraction methods.

Tobamoviruses and potexviruses are of increasing importance in biotechnology.  Potexviruses and especially potyviruses are of major agricultural importance.\r\n\r\n",
