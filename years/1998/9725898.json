 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725898  Jeanloz    This grant provides partial support to upgrade the ruby  fluorescence spectrometer at the UC-Berkeley high-pressure  laboratory with a charge-coupled device (CCD).  The ruby  fluorescence spectrometer is used to rapidly determine pressure  and pressure variations across very small samples (50-500  microns) inside diamond anvil cells (DAC).  Accurate  determination of the pressure distribution within a DAC allows  calculation of shear stresses within the cell and/or viscous  stress relaxation of materials that have been laser heated in  conjunction with high pressure DAC experiments.  The current  detector for UC-Berkeley ruby fluorescence system is an  antiquated photomultiplier tube (PMT) that has exceeded its  estimated 10 yr. life span.  New PMT's are currently manufactured  on a made-to-order basis only and have therefore increased in  price over the years as digital CCD's have entered the market and  become more affordable.  While still less expensive than CCD  detectors, PMT's are far less sensitive to emitted EM radiation  and cannot be used in experiments requiring pressures exceeding  60-70 GPa where sample sizes are necessarily very small and  emitted fluorescence is therefore weak.  PMT detectors thus limit  high P-T experiments to upper mantle conditions.  Additionally, a  CCD array can later be adapted for use in Raman spectroscopy    A ruby fluorescence spectrometer is a required tool in DAC  experimentation and the PI's choice of a CCD detector to replace  his PMT is well reasoned and forward looking.  This upgrade will  allow this PI, his students and colleagues to continue  provocative research aimed at understanding early Earth and  planetary differentiation and the structure of high pressure  mantle phases and synthetic materials.  ***",
