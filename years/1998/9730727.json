The project acknowledges the growing interest in integrated science as states have increased their science requirements for graduation and as states, school districts, and individual schools have struggled to implement various standards in science education.  This project is to help make sense of the diverse assumptions now in place about the goals, placement of, and content for integrated science in high school. The work  plan involves solicitation of substantive guidance from constituencies concerned with integrated science such as scientific organizations, publishers, teacher educators, teachers, science educators, mathematics educators, specialists in technology, and state science supervisors.  The advisory committee sets the framework for the design study and reviews the process of the BSCS staff.  The projected outcome is a report available in hard copy and on the BSCS web site.",
