This is an important topic since the standard models of our universe are contradictory to any fractal or multi-fractal properties. The models are based on the assumption that the universe, on some large scale, can essentially be treated as a liquid system. All the density enhancements such as galaxies, clusters, and superclusters, wash out and the matter in the universe becomes homogeneous and a measurable average density will exist. The multi-fractal picture of the universe is much different. No average density will ever be defined and the universe cannot be treated as a liquid system.    These two points of view are so radically different that hopefully there is some definitive evidence which rules one of them out.  The research to be carried out is aimed at finding that evidence. The research will proceed along three separate lines: Analysis of existing and anticipated data; Monte-Carlo simulations of false universes to create models of the true universe; N-body analysis in the new framework of fractals.    The analysis of galaxy catalogs requires fairly complete catalog material and robust software which can used to test those catalogs. Target catalogs, including their deficiencies, are to be compiled and some estimation of the time and effort required to modify already written computer programs is to be obtained. Furthermore, a pilot study of data taken with the Arecibo telescope (a nearby facility in Puerto Rico) is to be undertaken with the eventual goal being a much larger analysis of the data.    Creation of very simple multi-fractal universes which mimic the true universe will help to demonstrate the feasibility of the fractal framework. Studies will again be made on adapting software and on various multi-fractal generating schemes.    The final approach to this problem is the one which has the best possibility of telling something about the physics involved in  the processes which generate these fractal structures. A careful survey of the available N-body software should point out some candidate packages for this somewhat different type of analysis.    The anticipated result of this research, is to be a workable, concrete, well defined plan of attack to answer the question, \"Is the universe multi-fractal?\"  ***",
