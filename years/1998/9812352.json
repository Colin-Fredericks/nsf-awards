 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cornell Biological Field Station (CBFS) serves as a  primary field site for aquatic research at Cornell  University.  The principal mission of the Field Station is  to provide facilities for long-term ecological research and  to support the University's educational programs, with  special emphasis on freshwater systems.  A master planning  effort is proposed to address future research/training  program development at CBFS over the next five years.  The  primary goal of the proposed planning effort will be to  broaden the research and training program at CBFS to an  expanded user community.  The planning exercise will be a  workshop format and will focus on four objectives: 1)  identify new research directions that will add breadth and  strength to the existing research program 2) develop  strategies to facilities cross-site comparisons with the  long-term Oneida Lake data set, and 3) identify ways to  enhance the education/training mission of the field Station  and 4) prioritize facility improvements and equipment  needs associated with a strategic plan and panel  recommendations.",
