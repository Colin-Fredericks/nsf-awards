 "awd_abstract_narration": "A model, innovative program to restructure the elementary preservice teacher preparation program at the University of Virginia involves over twenty Education, Arts & Sciences, and Engineering faculty.  Because Virginia's new teacher liscensure requires the number of math and science credit hours to be increased from 12 to 24, sic new math and science content courses stressing hands-on activities are being developed, and three other courses are being restructured to be more aligned with National Math and Science Education standards.    After the preservice students have completed the six new math and science courses, they will take a capstone research/design experience being developed with the present NSF funding:  a six credit hour, two semester course of integrated math, science, and technology (including engineering and possibly medicine).  The first semester course will include completion of math and science content not previously taken, especially the integration of material including data analysis and presentation.  The students will also complete several mini-projects to acclimate them to research problem solving, and prospective faculty mentors will present possible student projects for the second semester.  During the second semester each group (3-4 students) will complete a research project under the direction of a faculty mentor.  Instructional technology will be emphasized in all phases of the project.    An independent evaluation/advisory committee will probed guidance and assessment on the project's quality and impact for both the project staff and for the preservice elementary education group of the NSF Teacher Preparation program that is supporting this effort.",
