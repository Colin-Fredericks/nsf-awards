 "awd_abstract_narration": "A one-week workshop on teaching ethics in computing courses will be held in each of two summers.  The point of the workshops is to promote the teaching of ethics in computing courses as intellectually rigorous, socially relevant, and effective learning experiences for students.  In addition to teaching basic topics relevant to ethics and computing, each workshop will also include seminars on the use of modern, effective teaching methods.    Workshop attendees will develop model activities and assignments that can be used in teaching ethics and computing, and that they will use and revise in their own teaching.  The collection of model activities/assignments from each workshop will be the immediate product of that workshop.  Follow-through activities will include an email discussion group for the workshop attendees, external review of the model activities/assignments, and revisions by the participants based on the feedback received.  The edited, revised, cumulative collection of these model activities/assignments will become a resource made generally available through the World Wide Web and possible publication.",
