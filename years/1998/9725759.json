 "awd_abstract_narration": "9725759  Jiracek    On the South Island of New Zealand, convergence of the Pacific and  Australian plates has given rise to a relatively narrow (~80 km  wide) and less complex zone of active mountain building than in  most other regions of the world.  The dominant structural elements  of the plate boundary are the Southern Alps where vertical movement  and accompanying rates of erosion are among the highest in the  world, and the Alpine Fault which has components of both strike-  slip and dip-slip movement.      The magnetotelluric work that willl be done under this project is  part of a four year cooperative study of the South Island plate  boundary involving U.S. and New Zealand scientists at USC, MIT,  Woods Hole, UC Berkeley, Purdue, San Diego State, Utah, Institute  for Geological and Nuclear Sciences (IGNS, NZ), Victoria University  (NZ), and Otago (NZ).  Support is being provided by both countries.    The centerpiece of the project is a pair of multifaceted  geophysical transects across the South Island including active  source seismology, offshore multichannel and OBS data acquisition,  passive seismology, petrophysics, magnetotellurics, gravity  measurements, and surface geology.  Experiments are aimed at  delineating the crustal and upper mantle structure beneath the  Southern Alps and adjacent regions.    MT data collected so far has led to a high-quality magnetotelluric  transect across the central South Island.  The MT response of the  interior of this orogen holds the exciting promise of understanding  the thermal regime and rheology of the South Island at depth.  The  complete resistivity structure will provide essential bounds on  crustal strain partitioning, metamorphism in the lower crust,  relative deformation of the crust versus the mantle, compensation  of the South Island uplift, and several other important processes.    However, there presently exists a crucial gap in the MT coverage  along the transect due to lack of land vehicle access across the  principal region of upl ift through the Main Divide of the South  Island.  The data collected in this project will close this gap in  coverage with six-eight new MT soundings supported by helicopter  transport.  Personnel from the IGNS will participate in this effort  and will provide manpower and logistical support.  ***",
