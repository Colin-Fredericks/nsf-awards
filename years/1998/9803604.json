 "awd_abstract_narration": "9803604  Bao    This project will support research on the mathematical issues and   computational methods for solving the following classes of direct and   inverse problems motivated by industrial applications:  inverse problems   in diffractive optics, modeling of structure enhanced nonlinear optical   effects, and optimal design problems in nonlinear optics. The main topics   of the proposed work include:  Uniqueness, stability, and regularity   properties for inverse problems in optics. Numerical computation of   inverse and optimal design problems in diffractive optics. Modeling of   nonlinear second harmonic generation in periodic structures. Structure   enhanced nonlinear optical effects. Well-posedness of a partial differential   equation model in nonlinear optics. Interface least-squares finite element   methods for solving the model problem. Computational methods for   design and optimization in nonlinear optics.    These problems arise naturally in modeling and design of micro diffractive   optics. Micro diffractive optics is a fundamental, emerging technology in   which optical devices are micromachined with very small structural   features. Exploiting diffraction effects, diffractive structures perform   functions unattainable with conventional optics.  Examples of current and   potential application areas include corrective lenses, electronic displays,   microsensors, lasers, optical storage systems, optical communication   components, and integrated opto-electronic semiconductor devices. The   practical applications and scientific developments have driven the need for   rigorous mathematical models, mathematical analysis, and numerical   algorithms to accurately describe the diffraction of complicated diffractive   structures, to compute electromagnetic vector fields and thus to predict the   performance of a given diffractive structure in linear and nonlinear optical   media, as well as to carry out optimal design of new structures. The   research has significant potential for evo lving new science and providing   industry with guidance to design and fabricate new optical devices.",
