 "awd_abstract_narration": "ECS-9732785\r\nLiu\r\nTime-Lagged Recurrent Networks (TLRN)are known to be more powerful than feedforward multilayer neural networks and in nonlinear systems identification and control. This project will investigate several fundamentally important theoretical and practical questions concerning TLRN's in two areas:\r\n\r\nStructural adaptivity and robustness analysis: For nonlinear function\r\napproximation using neural networks, the behavior of time-lagged\r\nrecurrent networks will be studied in comparison to feedforward neural networks. \r\nIt will be shown that, due to the existence of recurrencies in the network,\r\ntime-lagged recurrent networks will exhibit behavior equivalent to\r\nmultilayer feedforward neural networks with time-varying parameters.  It is\r\nexpected that a multilayer feedforward neural network with time-varying\r\npaxameters will exhibit adaptive behavior; and the study will show that time-lagged recurrent networks with fixed parameters will generally exhibit adaptive\r\nbehavior.  A thorough study of how time-lagged recurrent networks will\r\nperform under parameter perturbations will also be conducted.  Results\r\nwill be given as bounds for permissible parameter perturbations which\r\nguarantee to retain the desired performance of the network.\r\n\r\nTraining based on energy function approach: Stability of recurrent\r\nNeural networks which can be translated into convergent behavior and bounded\r\nsignals and parameters in the network is of fundamental interest.  The\r\nstability properties of tiine-lagged recurrent networks will be studied\r\nusing the Lyapunov's second method.  In applying the Lyapunov second method, one\r\nneeds to construct a Lyapunov function (or energy function).  Stability is\r\nguaranteed by the fart that the Lyapunov function is positive definite and\r\nis (monotonically) decreasing over time.  This stability analysis result will\r\nshed new lights on the training of neural networks for systems identification,\r\nwhich will lead to training algorithms with guaranteed convergence to the global\r\nminimum or to a solution.\r\n",
