The  research  investigates the surface  electronic  and  structural   properties  of  manganese  oxides  and  rare   earth  pnictnides  (nitrides). These materials of considerable  interest  because  they  have a ferromagnetic transition  that  appears  to  accompany  the  non-metal  to  metal  transition.  However,   the  relation   between  the  magnetic  behavior  and  the  electrical  transport  properties is now well understood. The  goals  of  the  program  are to understand the nature of the non-metal  to  metal  transition  near the ferromagnetic transition, and to investigate  how  the  surface  ferromagnetic properties and metallically  may  differ  from the bulk properties in these materials. The  program  will   address  important  issues  such  a  whether  the  surface  magnetism  precisely  follows that  of  the  bulk  material.  The  program  employs a large number of spectroscopic  techniques  and  characterization   tools  to  elucidate   the   electronic   band  structure,  bulk transport properties and magnetic properties  of  the  oxide  and  nitride  materials. While  this  is  fundamental  research  program the results of the project will be relevant  to  the  general  fields  of  magnetism  and  superconductivity.  For  example,  surface  magnetism and transport  properties  of  oxide  materials  are  fundamental issues in the  field  of  information  storage technology.  %%%  This is a collaborative focused research group proposal involving  three  principal  investigators with  complementary  experimental  skills.  The  research  deals with the relationship  between  the  surface  and  bulk properties of manganese oxide and  rare  earth  nitride  materials. In these materials, rapid changes in magnetic  properties  can  occur simultaneously with large changes  in  the  electrical  conductivity  are  ob served.  However,  the  relation  between these two phenomena is  not well understood. Further, the  relation between the surface properties of the materials and  the  bulk  properties  is  also  an open question.  This  effort  will  combine   a   range  of  surface  spectroscopic  and   structural  techniques to obtain new information about magnetic and transport  properties of these materials. Close collaboration with theorists  at  U  Nebraska - Omaha, U Nebraska - Lincoln, and  South  Dakota  School  of  Mines,  and Case Western Reserve  U  will  facilitate  interpretation  of  the measurements. While this  is  fundamental  research  program the results of the project will be relevant  to  the  general  fields  of  magnetism  and  superconductivity.
