The unexpected discovery of a metallic ground state, contrary  to  a  long-standing  prediction  of  an  insulator  by  localization  theory,  was made by the PI in resistivity measurements  on  high  mobility  silicon MOSFET's. This project will subject  the  newly  discovered  state  to  more  detailied  studies,  including   the  magnetic   field,   temperature,  mobility,  and  carrier-density  dependences of the conducting ground state. Measurements will  be  made on MOSFET's and on GeSi heterostructure devices. Portions of  the  measurements  will be made at the NSF-supported  Microkelvin  Facility  at  the University of Florida. The work is expected  to  improve  understanding of the ground state properties of the  2-D  electron  gas,  in  dilute systems with high  mobility  and  weak  disorder.  This  experimental  research project  will  involve  a  graduate  student researcher who will receive excellent  training  at  both  laboratory locations, beneficial to a future career  in  industry, government or academia.  %%%  This experimental research project is focuses on the properties  of a two-dimensional electron system, as exists in the surface  layer of a standard microelectronics device, the silicon MOSFET  (Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor). This device  exhibits conduction under the control of the gate electrode,  which, when biased positively, draws electrons to the surface  region, where they carry a current between the source and drain  electrodes. In high mobility MOSFET structures, the electrons,  when the gate is positive, exist in a well defined region, which  is planar or two dimensional. The PI's in the project have  recently discovered an unexpected property of  such a  \"two  dimensional electron gas\" in zero magnetic field and at  sufficiently low temperature.  The unexpected discovery is of a  metallic or conducting state, even at extremely low temperature.  It had previously been thought, due to unavoidable fluctuations  in the electric potential  in the planar region, and based on a  long-standing theoretical prediction of  \"localization\" of the  electrons, that the lowest temperature state would be an  insulator. The recent discovery of the metallic \"ground state\"  was made by the PI in resistivity measurements on high mobility  silicon MOSFET's. This project will subject the newly discovered  metallic 2-D ground state to more detailied studies, including  the magnetic field, temperature, mobility, and carrier-density  dependences of the conducting ground state. Measurements will be  made on MOSFET's and on GeSi heterostructure devices. Portions of  the research, which require measurements in the millidegree range  close to absolute zero temperature,  will be made at the NSF-  supported Microkelvin Facility at the University of Florida. The  work is expected to improve the understanding of the ground state  properties of the 2-D electron gas, in dilute systems with high  mobility and weak disorder. This experimental  research project  will involve a graduate student researcher who will receive  excellent training at both laboratory locations, beneficial to a  future career in industry, government or academia.  ***",
