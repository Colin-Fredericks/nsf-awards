 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project, supported in the   Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, focuses on the detailed   microscopic, macroscopic, and computational characterization of etched   silicon surfaces.  In particular, the use of a new class of aqueous,   fluorine-based etchants will be investigated.  Professor Hines and her   students at Cornell University will employ scanning tunneling microscopy   to study the physical structure (quality) of the resultant etch patterns   while etch rate measurements will give evidence of the kinetics of the   process.  Monte Carlo calculations will be incorporated to help simulate   the observed chemistry.  This CAREER project will improve the   computational skills of undergraduates and graduates through the   implementation of a `Numerical Analysis for Chemists` course.  Professor   Hines will also improve students' readiness for the workforce through   seminars in writing and public speaking skills.  The study and development of new chemistries which can be applied to   semiconductor processing systems continues to be a very vibrant area of   research.  Professor Hines and her students at Cornell University are   combining physical measurement techniques and computational simulations   to evaluate the use of a new family of aqueous, fluorine-based etchants.    Previous studies have suggested that atomically flat silicon surfaces   could be produced by these methods.  This CAREER project holds the   promise of producing results of substantial technological importance.    Professor Hines will enhance the development of scientists with skills in   the important area of computational chemistry through the introduction of   a new undergraduate/graduate student course in that area.  Technical   writing and public speaking skills will be developed through topical   seminars and coursework.",
