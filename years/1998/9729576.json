Johns Hopkins University  CISE Research Instrumentation:  Computational Techniques for 3-D Modeling and Analysis of Infrared and MRI Image Sequences     This research instrumentation award serves to acquire a high-speed   supercomputer which will enable the following research projects:    - New Techniques in Automatic Target Detection, Recognition, and Tracking from     Optical and Infrared Video Sequences,  - Segmentation, Modeling, and Statistical Characterization of the Geometry   of the Human Brain Cortex from Three-Dimensional Magnetic Resonance Images, and  -Spline Algorithms for the Reconstruction of MR Material Markers  from Tagged    Magnetic Resonance Images.    The proposed equipment will be dedicated to research in novel computational   techniques for modeling and analysis of infrared and magnetic resonance   imaging (MRI) data. The requested equipment will:    (a) Allow development and implementation of real-time and near-real-time   algorithms using 3-D morphological image processing and analysis techniques   (Project 1).  (b) Allow fast implementation of continuous image modeling and active   geometry algorithms to fit a topologically correct surface to the central   layer of the cortex, and development of efficient methods to statistically   characterize the shapes of the major sulci (fissures) of the cortex   (Project 2).  (c) Allow development and implementation of 3-D optical flow algorithms for   motion estimation, and enable solution of large matrix equations to   determine higher order spline coefficients for tag surface fitting and   analysis (Project 3).",
