In an apt analogy,  such  systems  can  be  regarded  as artificial molecules, the  individual  dots  being considered as atoms. The \"quantum dot\" is a small region in  the  surface  of a GaAs/AlGaAs wafer, similar to  those  used  in  advanced microelectronic devices. A two-dimensional electron  gas  is  produced just below the surface of the entire wafer, and then  miniature   electrodes   are  deposited   using   electron   beam  lithography which can isolate a tiny region containing as few  as  100   electrons,   called  a  qu antum   dot.    The   fundamental  characteristics of electrons in these systems; how electrons  are  shared  between dots, the energy of shared electron  states,  and  how electrons move through coupled dot circuits, are of interest.  Specific  measurements include Coulomb blockade  spectroscopy  of  small  tunnel-coupled  dots (less than 100  electrons  per  dot);  Coulomb  blockade  spectroscopy of  tunnel-coupled  dots  in  the  quantum  Hall regime; transport through single quantum dots  with  partially  open  leads, predicted to show interesting  many  body  effects; and transport through open electron wave resonators. Dot  samples  are  made at Harvard using electron beam lithography  on  GaAs/AlGaAs  wafers  grown via molecular beam  epitaxy  at  Univ.  California  Santa  Barbara. The research is  relevant  to  future  electronics  in  which devices will approach the  size  of  large  molecules. At this size scale quantum mechanics is important even  at  room  temperature. Quantum phenomena offer new approaches  to  computation ranging from ultra dense single-electron memories  to  quantum  computers projected to give an exponential  increase  in  speed.    The    research   here   addresses   the    fundamental  characteristics  of  quantum  mechanical  electron   states   and  electron transport in tunnel-coupled semiconductor nanostructures  as a first step toward these possible applications. This research  program  is interdisciplinary in nature and involves one or  more  graduate  students, who receive excellent training in preparation  for careers in industry, government laboratories or academia.  ***",
