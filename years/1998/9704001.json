 "awd_abstract_narration": "9704001  Baum       This research project centers on a conjecture formulated by P.  Baum and A. Connes.  If true, this conjecture gives an answer to the  problem of understanding and calculating the K-theory of group  C*-algebras.  Validity of the conjecture implies validity for the  Novikov conjecture (homotopy invariance of higher signatures), the  stable Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture (necessary and sufficient  conditions for a closed Spin manifold to admit a Riemannian metric of  positive scalar curvature), and the Kadison-Kaplansky conjecture  (non-existence of idempotents in the reduced C*-algebra of a  torsion-free discrete group).  When applied to Lie groups, the  conjecture makes precise the Mackey-Wigner analogy between the  tempered representation theory of a semi-simple Lie group G and the  representation theory of the semi-direct product Lie group that  Mackey and Wigner associate to G.  Thus the conjecture is unusual in  that it cuts across several different areas of mathematics and unifies  a number of problems and issues that previously appeared to be  unrelated.       A theme in nineteenth and twentieth century mathematics has been  that certain features of mathematical systems that at first glance  seem to be analytical (i.e., based on methods of calculus such as  differentiation and integration) in fact are topological (i.e., depend  only on elementary continuous geometry).  This research project  develops this theme within the new context of non-commutative  geometry.  A conjecture (formulated by P. Baum and A. Connes) will be  studied that relates analytic and topological invariants of locally  compact groups.  If true, the conjecture will be an underlying  principle revealing an unexpected unity in a number of mathematical  problems and issues.  ***",
