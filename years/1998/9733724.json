 "awd_abstract_narration": "9733724  Affatigato    The  Faculty  Early  Career Development project  will  use  laser  induced  time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (LITOF-MS) to determine  the  short-  and  intermediate-range order of  boron  oxide-based  glass  systems.  It is known that the network of pure boron oxide  glass   contains  hexagonal  rings  of  three-coordinated  boron.  Disagreement  exists,  however, regarding what  fraction  of  the  boron  present  in  the glass is tied up  in  these  rings.   The  straightforward deconvolution of time-of-flight mass spectra will  yield  valuable  information regarding  the  presence  of  larger  structural units in this glass, as well as quantitative  data  on  the  abundance of the ring groupings.  Alkali borate glasses  can  be  made  up of a variety of larger groups, including chains  and  hexagonal rings linked by four-coordinated borons.  The  presence  and  relative  abundance of these larger units in  alkali  borate  glasses  of varying compositions will be measured using the  mass  spectrometer.   Crystals  of  the  same  stoichiometry  will   be  investigated  and  used as starting points  for  calibration  and  analysis.    During  this  stage of the project,  the  effect  of  dopants (chromophores introduced into the glass at concentrations  below  1  molar  percent) on the yield of network groupings  upon  laser  irradiation will be examined.  In the last  stage  of  the  project,  the  LITOF-MS will be used to study alkali borosilicate  glasses.  It is generally agreed that these glasses are  made  up  mostly  of silicate and borate sub-networks, but questions remain  about  the effect of dopants and if there is interaction  between  the  two  networks.   NMR data yields contradictory  evidence  on  these  matters,  but the LITOF-MS should provide  data  that  can  answer   these  questions.   As  Coe  College  is   a   primarily  undergraduate  institution, the work will  be  carried  out  with  undergraduate students, providing them a rare long-term  researc h  exposure to cutting-edge work in materials science.  The students  will  carry  out the sample manufacture and characterization,  as  well  as  the time of flight measurements. In addition,  outreach  programs  will bridge the gap between the College and  the  local  high  schools.  The upper-level physics and chemistry classes  of  two  nearby  high  schools will be brought on campus  for  yearly  visits  and  seminars on careers in science and engineering,  and  will   have   several   opportunities  to   interact   with   the  undergraduate researchers.  %%%  This  CAREER  project  will  seek to answer  several  fundamental  questions  about  boron oxide-based glasses using  laser  induced  time-of-flight mass spectroscopy (LITOF-MS) to examine the short-  and  intermediate-range atomic arrangements.   The  project  will  help   us  understand  the  structure  of  these  technologically  important  materials.  The involvement of undergraduate  students  in  the  performance  of  the research  will  provide  them  with  experience in materials research.  ***",
