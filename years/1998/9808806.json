 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT                                            This project will meet fundamental challenge for the biocollections    community: enabling the capture, management, integration and    dissemination of specimen data for research, education, resource    management and public policy.  The project will deploy, develop and    support a community-based applications suite for biocollections data    that will provide the foundation for a stable, secure and scalable    informatics infrastructure.  Version 1.0 of this application, called    OZ, has been developed    funding and will be released and distributed at no charge to the  biocollections community.      OZ has been designed as a community database schema and application    suite for Microsoft's Win95 and NT operating systems for the capture,    maintenance, integration and dissemination of computerized biological    collections data. OZ is a multi-taxonomic database management system    supporting data from plant, fish, amphibian, reptile, bird, mammal,    insect, general invertebrate, and paleontological collections.  OZ    functions/features include: fully customizable user interface    screens; all standard collections transactions; local, direct SQL and    on-line web query access to the data--all protected by a security    system; custom reports, invoices and labels; and a user manual.        Most importantly, the biocollections community is actively    informing and guiding the development of    OZ, which is overseen by the PI, co-PI, a Project Manager and an    Advisory Board at the University of    Kansas Natural History Museum (KLINHM). Community partners and    collaborators in OZ's    development include the US Organization for Biodiversity Information    CUSOBI), many MUSE    installations, the San Diego Supercomputer Center and the National    Museum of Natural History,    Leiden,  The Netherlands. Development    of OZ is part of a larger USOBI informatics initiative to build and    support software  tools for integrating biocollections data with other    biotic, geospatial and climatic data, sets. KUNHM's commitment to    this project includes creation of new positions for the PI and    Project Manager.",
