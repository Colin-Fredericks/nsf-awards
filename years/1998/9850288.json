 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue the efforts of Project TEAM (Technical Education for Advanced Manufacturing).  The partners in Project TEAM include Cleveland State University (CSU) and its Advanced Manufacturing Center (AMC), the Cleveland Advanced Manufacturing Program (CAMP), Cuyahoga (CCC), Lakeland (LCC) and Lorain County (LCCC) community colleges and their respective Tech Prep Consortia, Youth Opportunities Unlimited (YOU), and the 102 manufacturing companies that have sponsored projects. The activities center on the concept of a teaching factory, called the Manufacturing Learning Center (MLC), that provides hands-on learning for participants who work on industry sponsored projects. The overarching goals of Project TEAM are to stimulate interest in all phases of manufacturing in the Northern Ohio region and to provide a well educated manufacturing workforce through the development of a continuum of manufacturing education and training programs that will allow multiple entry and exit points.  The specific goals are to (1) ensure the long-term sustainability of the newly established MLC locations at Lakeland and Lorain County Community Colleges as laboratories for hands-on manufacturing learning; (2) support innovative teaching methods among secondary math, science, and technology teachers and engineering and technology faculty in the community colleges and universities; (3) support student success in manufacturing-related technology educational programs; and (4) ensure systemic educational reforms by fully integrating curricula additions and revisions into each partner institution.",
