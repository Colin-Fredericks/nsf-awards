Miller    \"Surface Characterization of Adsorption and Interfacial Reactions-II,\" is the title of the proposed Engineering Foundation Conference.  This conference will be sequel to the successful 1994 conference of the same title and focus.    Like the previous conference, international participation of well-organized researchers is expected.  In particular, numerous researchers from the pacific Rim, South America, and Europe have already demonstrated an interest in participating in the conference.    The Conference has multiple objectives.  The first objective is to convene a truly multi-disciplinary group of top quality researchers from academia, industry and government interested in the advancement of  the understanding of surface characterization of adsorption and interfacial reactions.  The second objective is to provide a broad-based forum for these researchers to aid in cross-fertilization of current findings and ideas.    NSF support is requested for transportation, lodging, and registration costs of invited speakers from the United States.  It should be noted that this support will augment substantial support already committed by industrial sponsors of  the Conference. The Engineering Foundation, and the U.S. Japan/Air Force Office of  Scientific Research.  ***",
