The project is directed by Deborah Schifter of the Education Development Center (EDC), with Co-PI's Susan Jo Russell of TERC, and Virginia Bastable of Mt. Holyoke College.  This is a 4.5 year project, which will involve between 540-640 teachers.       This project builds off of a prior funded project that dealt with Teaching to the Big Ideas involving number.  Within each project module proposed in this project, the writers plan to integrate a variety of activities centered around print and video cases.  This will include mathematics examples, investigation of the thinking of students, an analysis of tasks drawn from NSF-funded elementary curriculum projects (Investigations, Trailblazers, and Everyday Math), and the reading and review of research related to a theme central to the module.  The PI's believe strongly that teachers can improve aspects of their teaching practice through engaging discussions with their peers.  Cases situated in a classroom context help to provide the access to the issues driving such discussions.     All of the NSF-funded elementary curriculum projects will be used in this project as the source of mathematics tasks.",
