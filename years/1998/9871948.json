These areas were recommended by the West Virginia  EPSCoR Committee and represent areas of special consideration by  the West Virginia Science and Technology Advisory Council.  The  high performance computing, communications, and software initiative  involves a statewide computer science initiative to strengthen  computer science instruction throughout West Virginia, a computing  technology initiative to provide the latest computing technology  for research applications, a scientific computing initiative to  develop more high performance computing applications in science and  engineering in West Virginia, and a business and industry  initiative to improve the use of high performance computing and  communications technology by West Virginia businesses.  The  identification technologies thrust builds upon recent EPSCoR and  state investments at Marshall University by providing new core  facilities in the College of Science to encourage collaborative  research and research training with faculty members in the School  of Medicine.  At West Virginia University, investments in  identification technologies research infrastructure will provide  necessary expertise in mathematics, computer science, and  electrical engineering for the university to build a program in  these disciplines.  West Virginia EPSCoR, housed within the  Governor's Office of Technology, builds academic capability which  is related to the state plan for science and technology and relates  to other statewide development initiatives.  Through this award,  West Virginia will develop academic strength in these two R&D areas  which will provide  a foundation for future",
