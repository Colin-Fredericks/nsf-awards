Glenn Lipscomb  Affiliation:                   University of Toledo        This grant is awarded through the Separations and Purification Program sub-element of the Interfacial, Transport and Separations Program of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division. The principal investigator is Dr. Y.S. Lin at the University of Cincinnati. The conference is the Meeting of the North American Membrane Society, to be held  May 16-20, 1998, in Cleveland, Ohio. The grant will provide travel support to graduate students who will be presenting their work at the conference.      This is a topical area fully relevant to the Interfacial, Transport and Separation Processes Program.  The conference is an excellent forum for the latest advances in membrane science and technology, and brings together the leading researchers in the area. Graduate students whose research is in membrane science will benefit immensely from attending the conference and presenting their research. . A very useful aspect of the conference is the organization of two workshops that are directly related to graduate student career development. The first is a roundtable discussion led by senior graduate students to discuss research, thesis and career experiences. The second is a discussion led by academic, industrial and government leaders in the membrane field again targeted towards student career opportunities. Facilitating graduate student participation in  the conference will enhance the country's research infrastructure in membrane science and technology.",
