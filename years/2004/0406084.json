 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long plans to work on various old and new projects in geometric,\r\nalgebraic and structural aspects of low and high dimensional hyperbolic\r\nmanifolds.  The problems are drawn from  a variety of areas: One family of\r\nproblems comes from questions about surface groups, which are of \r\ninterest not only in low dimensional topology, but also in certain \r\nparts of number theory. As an example, we will investigate\r\nwhether hyperbolic 3-orbifolds must contain a surface group, or\r\nwhether one can increase the homology of a hyperbolic bundle. Another\r\nfamily of questions come from the study of character varieties.  In\r\nhigher dimensions the proposer will consider constructions as well as\r\ngeometrical bordism questions coming from physics.  Finally, the\r\nproposer will work on projects connected to a broad range of questions\r\narising from the arithmetic of hyperbolic manifolds.\r\n\r\nA space is called  a 3-manifold if it is made of small chunks all of\r\nwhich are ``like'' the ordinary 3-dimensional space that we live in.\r\nThis proposal directs itself towards aspects of the structural study\r\nof the most important class of 3-manifolds, the so-called hyperbolic\r\n3-manifolds. This class is ubiquitous in mathematics and physics, for \r\nexample although the nature of the universe has yet to be resolved, \r\nthere is at least one group who have suggested that the universe is \r\nthe Picard orbifold - a hyperbolic orbifold. The proposer has results \r\nwhich restrict the sorts of manifolds which can arise in certain \r\nphysical models of the universe. He also intends to contain work on a \r\nfamous old conjecture about which sorts of two-dimensional objects can\r\nlive inside these 3-dimensional objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
