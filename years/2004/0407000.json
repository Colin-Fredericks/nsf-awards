 "awd_abstract_narration": "The first part of the project is concerned with topological and string-theoretic\r\ninvariants of orbifolds. Based on physical predictions, Chen and Ruan introduced\r\na new cohomology theory for orbifolds. The object of study here will be algebraic\r\nstructures on the orbifold cohomology and relations with other cohomology \r\ntheories. Applications and generalizations of the chiral de Rham complex, a\r\ncanonical sheaf of vertex algebras associated to a manifold, are in the focus of\r\nthe second part of the project. In particular, vertex algebras and modules\r\nrelated to general orbifolds and their relation with orbifold cohomology,\r\nelliptic genus and quantum cohomology will be investigated. The aim of the third\r\npart of the project is to study geometric and algebraic structures related to\r\ncohomological field theories of spin type and the corresponding spin analogs of\r\nquantum cohomology and Gromov-Witten invariants. This part is related to a\r\nconjecture by E.Witten stating that the generating function of intersection\r\nnumbers on the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces with r-spin structures is a\r\ntau-function of the r-KdV hierarchy.\r\n\r\nIdeas coming from physical models of quantum field theory are responsible for\r\nmany exciting recent developments in mathematics, in particular in topology and\r\ngeometry. This project studies several geometric problems inspired by string\r\ntheory, the current candidate for the theory unifying all kinds of physical\r\nforces.  Because of lack of experimental tools, physicists working in string\r\ntheory are testing their methods on sophisticated mathematical models, and their\r\nresults often indicate the existence of conjectural ties between various\r\nseemingly remote mathematical objects. The goal of the current project is a\r\nmathematical study of some of these conjectures and interactions. Besides\r\nproducing new mathematical results, it may lead to a mathematical foundation for\r\nsome physical models and a justification of physical ways of analyzing them.\r\n",
