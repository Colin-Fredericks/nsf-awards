Baz\r\nUniv of Maryland College Park \r\n\r\nThe need for smart devices for locating the position, tracking the motion, and monitoring the health of emergency responders inside burning or collapsing buildings has become one of the important priorities of the nation.  Therefore, we will develop an Intelligent Life Searching and Saving (ILSS) Sensor System to address these priorities. The proposed sensor system will utilize Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) technology to accurately locate the responders. The sensor system will be simple, compact, and easy to integrate with an array of sensors to monitor the vital signs of the emergency responders.  The research, development, in-laboratory testing, and in-field evaluation of the performance characteristics of the ILSS sensor system will be carried out by the Small Smart System Center, Fire Protection Engineering department, Maryland Fire and Rescue Institute at the University of Maryland and InfraTech, Inc. The proposed efforts will involve graduate, undergraduate, and minority students as well as engineers, and firefighter inspectors.\r\n\r\n",
