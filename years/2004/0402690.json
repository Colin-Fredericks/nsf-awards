 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Pathways Program is to increase the number, diversity and quality of prospective science and mathematics middle school teachers. Students enroll in technology-rich mathematics and science classes at Antelope Valley College, transfer to California State University Bakersfield-Antelope Valley, graduate, and begin a career teaching mathematics and science at the middle school level. The program is supported by a large community which, in 2001, established the Mathematics Science Engineering Technology (MSET) Consortium comprised of over 50 regional businesses, government agencies and K-16 school districts including Antelope Valley College, California State University Bakersfield, NASA Dryden, Edwards AFB, Air Force Research Laboratory, Boeing, Lockheed-Martin, Northrop-Grumman, the cities of Lancaster and Palmdale, and the Lancaster, Palmdale, Westside and Antelope Valley School Districts. The MSET Consortium is committed to supporting educational development and is contributing technical expertise and other assets to the Pathways Program.  \r\n     To increase the number and diversity of prospective students, the STEM Pathways Program actively recruits under-represented students. A safety net of support services, including academic advising, tutoring, career development, faculty mentoring and mentoring from MSET members, is provided by the Pathways Program during their collegiate careers. The students, as a learning community, are encouraged to develop strong interrelationships and to use their knowledge as peer counselors for future students.   \r\n     A variety of strategies is being employed to increase the quality of mathematics, science and technology education available for prospective teachers at Antelope Valley College and California State University Bakersfield. These strategies include developing mathematics and science courses and curricula which incorporate technology and hands-on, inquiry-based learning, creating field experience opportunities in middle school mathematics and science classrooms, and providing intensive Summer Institutes twice each year for in-service middle school teachers to introduce them to new pedagogical approaches in the learning and comprehension of mathematics and science.  \r\n",
