 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project from Louisiana State University (LSU) and University of Wisconsin (UW) proposes a hybrid approach to further advance the technology of high temperature metal micromolding. By combining elements of LiGA, microscale electrical discharge machining, high density plasma etching and smoothing, and high temperature nanostructured ceramic coatings, we aim to achieve high temperature micromolding of Ni-Fe alloys and build Ni-Fe based electromagnetic microactuators.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Pushing the technology of metal micromolding to much higher temperatures (~800 oC) entails undertaking significant research in a number of areas:\r\n1)\tDeveloping new means of efficient fabrication of complex, high-aspect-ratio, microscale patterns out of high temperature materials\r\n2)\tUnderstanding critical factors controlling high temperature structural and chemical stability of nanostructured ceramic coatings\r\n3)\tUnderstanding high temperature tribochemistry of sliding contacts between ceramic nanocomposites and Ni-Fe alloys\r\n4)\tUnderstanding mechanics of the high temperature micromolding process\r\n5)\tImproving design of microelectromagnetic devices for manufacturing by micromolding\r\nCompletion and integration of these research elements lay the scientific foundation of high temperature micromanufacturing of metal-based HARMs devices.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: The ability to inexpensively replicate metal and alloy based HARMs by molding offers the potential for commercialization of numerous microelectromagnetic, micromechanical, and microchemical devices. Through joint LSU-WU workshops, interactions between students from both institutions will be promoted. The planned research exposes graduate students to diverse disciplines. Through ongoing interactions between LSU and Southern University (SU), we will interest minority students in micromanufacturing research, and recruit them into graduate programs at LSU and SU.\r\n",
