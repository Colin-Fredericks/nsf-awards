 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of our exploratory research is to expand the study of science inquiry by investigating the potential of immersive simulations.  In immersive simulations, such as the case of a disease outbreak, participants not only act out roles in a simulation, but through virtual selves, or avatars, are directly impacted by the simulation. For immersive simulations to be an effective learning experience, students' inquiry into the simulation needs to be scaffolded.  This study uses a large stratified random sample of about 800 Whyville users accounting for age, gender and level of involvement;  and it develops and refines online tools to support the collaborative investigation of disease simulations and the development of explanations.  The study will examine: (1) the educational impact of immersive science simulations, (2) the adoption of established web-based inquiry tools developed in the education community for multi-user online environments; and (3) the nature of online and offline support structures for science inquiry in settings such as classrooms, after school programs, and homes which provide access to places like Whyville.",
