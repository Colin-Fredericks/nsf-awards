 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will fund an assessment of research opportunities in the interdisciplinary field of \"biomolecular materials\" -- the interface of materials science and biology. Biomolecular materials are structured or processed in a way that is characteristic of biological materials, but they are not necessarily of biological origin. The challenges in this field lie not only in learning from and mimicking nature, but also in building a more thorough understanding of the production processes and the functionality of biomolecular materials. Better understanding of these principles, coupled with new advances in physics, biology, chemistry, and genetics, researchers will enable design of new tools and processes to meet specific needs. These principles will also give us a deeper understanding of the mechanisms in living systems. A National Research Council study committee, composed of about 15 leading experts in the field, will meet three times over a period of 18 months to prepare a report on this field. The first phase of the study will provide an authoritative assessment of progress in the field. The second phase will develop an outlook for the future and make recommendations aimed at enabling the development of a U.S. strategy to achieve leadership in the study of biomolecular materials. The report of the committee, published by the National Academy Press, will be made available on the Academies' website.\r\n\r\nThis project will fund an assessment of research opportunities in the interdisciplinary field of \"biomolecular materials\" -- the interface of materials science and biology. Biomolecular materials are materials designed and engineered by humans that have been inspired by the wealth of molecules in biological systems. Because of their diversity, versatility, and unusual combinations of properties, biomolecular materials offer promise for application in virtually all sectors of the economy-including security, energy, agriculture, health, and environmental technology. A National Research Council study committee, composed of about 15 leading experts in the field, will meet three times over a period of 18 months to prepare a report on this field. The first phase of the study will provide an authoritative assessment of progress in the field. The second phase will develop an outlook for the future and make recommendations aimed at enabling the development of a U.S. strategy to achieve leadership in the study of biomolecular materials. The work of the committee will be widely disseminated to improve public understanding of this area of science and to inform decision makers in Washington as they formulate the Nation's research programs. The report of the committee, published by the National Academy Press, will be made available on the Academies' website.\r\n",
