 "awd_abstract_narration": "This goal of this project is to synthesize and characterization the structure and properties of novel f-metal containing organic/inorganic hybrid materials.  These compounds, in particular the metal-organic framework materials (MOFs), have importance and potential applications to areas such as spent nuclear fuel storage, magnetic and optical materials, sensing, catalysis, and separations. Novel approaches to the generation of these materials are presented and include the use of heterofunctional ligands to promote heteronuclear compounds, organic template 'aging' to control the oxidation states of the metals and examination of formation pathways using time-resolved in situ x-ray diffraction at synchrotron facilities.  By design, this research program contains a particular commitment to the education and training of students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels.  Various degrees of participation incorporated into this research project include fundamental and/or exploratory syntheses and characterization efforts designed for undergraduates, as well as longer term projects for graduate students that include establishing crystal chemical systematics and structure-property relationships.\r\n%%%\r\nThis research project aims to synthesize and characterize novel organic/inorganic hybrid materials for potential applications areas such as catalysis, molecular recognition and separation, sensing, electronic materials and environmental stewardship and remediation. The research project is designed specifically for the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students and maintains a particular commitment to educating and training the next generation of scientists and critical thinkers.  Students will be exposed to cutting-edge research techniques such as novel synthesis routes and 'big science' facilities found at National Laboratories.   Public support of this effort is justified considering the tangible scientific output, as well as the longer-term investment in the education of its participants.\r\n***\r\n",
