 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemically complex oxides and other materials are being investigated not only for the interesting physical phenomena they exhibit but also with a view to incorporating them in devices to perform desired functions.   Such functional, complex materials with various coupled physical degrees of freedom have proven to be conducive to mesoscopic phase modulations. Scientific understanding of the interrelationship between these modulations and macroscopic physical properties is of prime importance for controlling the technological functionality of complex materials.  This project is focused on the synthesis of a variety of novel systems and collaborative experiments for the study of their physical properties. The specific topics include the nanoscale self-organization of spin clusters in frustrated antiferromagnets, multiscale ferromagnetic domain structures in manganites and the dynamic reordering of charge carriers in mixed-valent oxides. The possible correlation of charge density waves and vortices in Bi superconductors and the physics of ferroelectric relaxors will be also studied. The proposed activities will further strengthen the role of research at all levels of education by employing (underrepresented) high school students (through, e.g., the Liberty Science Center, New Jersey), undergraduate students, graduate students as well as postdocs. Research results from this project will be used for enriching graduate materials physics course. \r\n\r\nThe presence of many small, mesocopic regions of distinct electronic or magnetic structures in novel materials may lead to entirely different macroscopic properties. The proposed research is aimed at the understanding of the interrelationship between these mesoscopic phase modulations and macroscopic physical properties in several materials.  This understanding can be the decisive factor that will make the use of complex materials to perform desired functions in emerging technologies possible.  The project involves synthesis and characterization efforts using a variety of techniques and skills available through an established, collaborative inter-institutional and international team of researchers. The proposed study will further strengthen the role of research at all levels of education by employing high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. For example, high school students will be involved in the proposed research through the Partners in Science program (organized by the Liberty Science Center, NJ) and a summer workshop for the underrepresented high school students in the Newark area. \r\n",
