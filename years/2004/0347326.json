 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major threat facing most animal populations is habitat destruction due to urbanization (i.e., human development).  Urbanization may be especially destructive to populations of amphibians and reptiles, which are declining precipitously in many regions.  In this CAREER proposal, Dr. Dorcas will develop a program based on undergraduate research to examine the effects of urbanization on amphibians and reptiles.  He will establish a study to explore reasons for an already documented detrimental effect of urbanization on salamanders living in small streams in North Carolina.  Salamanders will be systematically sampled from streams and their numbers compared before, during, and after development of the streams' watersheds.  The PI will also examine how semi-aquatic turtles inhabiting small ponds respond to urbanization.  Turtles will be trapped before, during, and after development, and radiotelemetry will be used to monitor their movements.  \r\n\r\nBecause amphibians and reptiles may be more sensitive to environmental degradation than some other animals, studies such as this one can provide early evidence of environmental degradation.  Many undergraduate students will be presented with a wide variety of opportunities to participate in high-quality research.  Finally, an outreach program to the local community and to local schools will intimately involve community members in the research and will increase appreciation of amphibians and reptiles as important parts of our natural heritage.\r\n",
