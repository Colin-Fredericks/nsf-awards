There are often partial\r\ndifferential equations which behave well with respect to these\r\ngluing functions, and in turn these PDEs can be used to study the\r\ngeometric structure.  Dr. Loftin will continue to apply the\r\ntheory of Monge-Ampere equations to manifolds with geometric\r\nstructure.  In particular, the relationship between Goldman's\r\nFenchel-Nielsen type coordinates on the deformation space of\r\nconvex real projective surfaces and the holomorphic coordinates\r\nintroduced by Loftin will be further studied.  Together with Eric\r\nZaslow and S.T.  Yau, Dr. Loftin will study parabolic affine\r\nsphere metrics on certain affine manifolds with singularities.\r\nThese metrics are degenerate real slices of the Calabi-Yau\r\nmetrics.  Yau, Zaslow, and Loftin will follow the conjecture of\r\nStrominger-Yau-Zaslow to relate these metrics to a larger program\r\narising from string theory of understanding mirror symmetry of\r\nCalabi-Yau manifolds.\r\n\r\nMonge-Ampere equations have an illustrious history in\r\ndifferential geometry.  Yau's celebrated theorem constructed\r\nimportant notions of distance on a large class of spaces\r\n(so-called Calabi-Yau manifolds) by solving a Monge-Ampere\r\nequation.  Dr. Loftin will study Monge-Ampere equations on other\r\nspaces.  Some of these spaces are useful in the study of string\r\ntheory, a physical theory which proposes a unification of all the\r\nforces in nature.  In particular, there are singular Calabi-Yau\r\nspaces which Dr. Loftin, together with Yau and Zaslow, will study\r\nin order to shed light on the physics of string theory.  Also,\r\nDr. Loftin will put also into practice curricular extensions in\r\nteaching precalculus.  These extensions were developed in a\r\nprogram involving other faculty and high school teachers, in\r\nJuly, 2003, associated with Columbia University's VIGRE program.\r\nHe will also continue to develop similar curricular extensions.\r\n",
