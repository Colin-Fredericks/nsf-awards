 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks to sponsor U.S. faculty and researchers to attend the first SINO-US\r\nWorkshop on Computer and Computational Sciences (WCCS) to be held in Beijing 2005. The\r\npurpose of the workshop is to strengthen research exchange in computer sciences, and to\r\npromote successful collaborations between experts in the field. WCCS provides a forum for\r\npresenting the latest advances in computer and computational sciences, engineering, and\r\ntechnologies. It also provides a platform for discussing the practical challenges\r\nencountered and the solutions adopted thus far. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nA particular aim of WCCS is to bridge the gap between the research community and the\r\napplication domains, and to foster discussion and technology exchange between these two\r\ncommunities within the two geographic regions (US and Asia). As such, we have invited\r\ntop-notch researchers in the computer science community to serve on the Technical\r\nProgram Committee. \r\nWe believe that by offering funding for selected U.S. scientists (who would not otherwise\r\nbe able to attend due to monetary obstacle), these individuals and the overall workshop \r\ngoals will benefit. Travel support for attendance will be advertised nationwide; women,\r\nminorities and disabled faculty and researchers will be especially encouraged to apply for\r\nsponsorship.\r\n\r\nThe foremost goal is to establish contacts for future collaborations and to allow for ideas\r\nand solutions to be exchanged.",
