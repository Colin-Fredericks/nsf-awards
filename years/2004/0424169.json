 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns the study of the role of power electronic loads in interconnected power systems. Due to their nonlinear (switching) character and increasing penetration, there is a critical need to understand precisely how such loads will impact both stability and transient behavior of large and medium-scale power systems. The proposed research combines analytical work, simulation studies, laboratory experiments, and analysis of real field data to address potential deleterious impact of such loads on the electrical power system. Analytical study of the dynamical behavior of simple systems with power electronic loads is proposed as a means of identifying the key mechanisms of their complex behavior. These studies will in turn support the development of state-of-the-art load and system models that enable simulation of medium and large-scale power networks, with sufficient fidelity to evaluate the impact of non-linear loads. Modeling work will involve developing aggregate load models to capture the effect of hundreds of thousands of such devices. Experimental work both in the laboratory in cooperation with EPRI-PEAC, and based on field data to be supplied by Austin Energy (the municipal utility of Austin, Texas) will be used to validate and tune the models and identify the key features of the dynamical behavior expected from real systems. In turn, analysis and simulation will be used to evaluate the stability and transient behavior of such systems with increasing penetration of power-electronic loads.\r\n",
