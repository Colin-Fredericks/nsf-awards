Tin oxide-based gas sensors have been synthesized in various forms but their sensitivity at room temperature has been poor.  In this project a nanocrystalline porous thin film of proton-conducting ceramic membranes will be fabricated on the tin oxide sensor.  Candidate materials include oxides of barium, cerium, and strontium.  This membrane is expected to increase the sensitivity of the device by increasing the selectivity for hydrogen.  Sol-gel and carbothermal synthesis techniques will be used for fabricating nanocrystalline, dense, porous, doped tin oxide sensors in thin film and wire form.  Gold and platinum catalysts will be introduced in the thin film by sputtering.  Nanowires will provide a higher surface area than particulates.  A prototype sensor will be exposed to ultraviolet radiation to enhance the amount of surface adsorbed oxygen ions and to enhance the catalytic decomposition of the hydrogen gas over the sensor surface.  In terms of the broader impacts, this work could lead to a more sensitive, robust sensor for the detection of hydrogen, which is currently being considered as a source of energy in several applications.  Such a device would be used to detect hydrogen leaks and avoid potential fires and explosions.\r\n",
