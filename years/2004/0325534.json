 "awd_abstract_narration": "A daunting challenge is the evolution from today's computational Grid to a true cyberinfrastructure that \r\nseamlessly  integrates resources ranging from  small  clusters in academic laboratories to the largest \r\nnational  supercomputing  centers  and  provides  ubiquitous  access  to  high  performance  computing, \r\nresearch  instrumentation,  data warehouses and visualization.  Realization of  this future requires \r\nfundamental advances in transparent fault recovery mechanisms to mask component failures endemic \r\nto any large-scale computational resource. While previous generations of supercomputers engineered \r\nreliability into systems hardware, today's high performance computing (HPC) environments are based \r\non clusters of COTS  components, with no systemic solution  for the reliability  of  the resource  as a \r\nwhole.    Engendering  stability  in  ever  growing  networked  collections  of  cluster  systems  needs  a \r\nsoftware solution that provides reliable access to computing resources through transparent, efficient, \r\nand  automatic  checkpointing  and  recovery  (CPR)  mechanisms.  This  propoject aims  to bring about  this  future  through  radically new approaches  to longstanding problems in CPR and process migration by building an integrated system called Daja vu.  Daja vu provides (a) a transparent parallel checkpointing and recovery mechanism that recovers from any combination of systems failures without any modification to parallel applications. (b) a novel post-compiler analysis system that transparently captures application state, (c) a systems architecture that seamlessly  integrates user-initiated  and  system-initiated  checkpoints  in a single  framework enabling the effective use of a wide  variety of domain specific knowledge,  (d) novel  runtime mechanisms  for transparent  incremental  checkpointing,  to  efficiently  capture  the  least  amount  of  state  required  to maintain  global  consistency,  (e)  a  novel  communications  architecture  that  enables  transparent migration of existing MPI/PVM codes without source-code modifications to either the application or the MPI/PVM  libraries,  (f)  recoverable  IO  subsystems  that  can  be  tailored  to  specific  storage environments, and (g) interfaces to and augmentation of the Globus Toolkit to effectively use the CPR and migration capabilities provided by this research. The core CPR and migration facilities of Deja vu will  be  surrounded  by management, security,  and scheduling  facilities  that  (a)  integrate  with  local scheduling systems  (e.g., OpenPBS)  and accounting  systems for site-specific  accounting and refunding of lost compute cycles and (b) extend the Globus security architecture with fine grain rights and dynamically created user accounts that allow the fluid resource control available under the Deja vu system to be fully exploited. \r\nThe design goal of this project is not just to implement \"point\" solutions, but an integrated system that will constitute a fundamental component of both large-scale computing facilities and Grid infrastructures. Our \r\nresearch team (VT, PSC, ISR) has considerable experience in the design, development, deployment \r\nand support of complete solutions. \r\n",
