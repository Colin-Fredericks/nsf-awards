 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project will involve the study of nuclear reactions utilizing short-lived radioactive nuclear beams (RNBs) together with the development of instrumentation, techniques, and apparatus to facilitate nuclear research in general and RNB studies in particular. Specific experiments will emphasize the investigation of the structure and reaction mechanisms of neutron- and proton-rich nuclei near the limits of nuclear stability.\r\nThese studies are a continuation of a very successful program to elucidate the unusual effects that the exotic\r\nnuclear halo structure, which appears for weakly-bound systems at the limits of stability, has on various\r\nnuclear reactions. Another part of the project relates to the synthesis of elements in normal stars, as well\r\nas in supernova explosions and other extreme astrophysical environments. As appropriate, the work will\r\nbe carried out at the University of Notre Dame (UND), Oak Ridge National Lab (ORNL), and possibly\r\nat the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) . Finally, the production and properties of\r\nFermium and trans-Fermium isotopes will be studied in collaboration with a group at Texas A&M University\r\n(TAMU), and other experiments using heavy-ion reactions at intermediate energies will be carried out. This\r\nwork will involve the use of the UM BigSol 7T solenoid apparatus, which has been relocated to a dedicated\r\nbeamline at the TAMU K500 superconducting-cyclotron laboratory and is now operational.\r\nProposed technology development projects include an upgrade of the University of Michigan (UM) dual\r\n6T superconducting solenoid ion-optical system (TwinSol ), presently at UND. Related to this, the construc-\r\ntion of an expanded particle-neutron coincidence detector array is proposed. This will upgrade the existing\r\nlow-energy RNB facility to allow for more detailed studies of nuclear reactions with already-available beams, and for the development and use of new, higher-atomic-number (Z) beams.\r\nThe proposed research will have an impact on graduate, undergraduate, and high school education, as\r\nwell as on the development of a technologically- literate work force and the commercial applications of\r\nsuperconducting magnet technology. The project will involve graduate and undergraduate students from the\r\nUniversity of Michigan and the University of Notre Dame, together with faculty members and students from\r\nseveral other (primarily undergraduate) schools located in the Midwest, in close proximity to UM and UND.\r\nThe hands-on training of these students in the use of advanced, state-of-the-art computational methods,\r\nnuclear accelerators, radiation detectors, vacuum and cryogenic techniques, and superconducting ion-optical\r\nmagnetic systems has already had an important impact on the development of a technologically-literate\r\nscientific workforce. Several of the graduate students and postdoctoral research associates who worked\r\non this project in the past are currently employed in highly-responsible positions on national-security and\r\nmedical-physics related projects. Still others hold tenured or tenure-track academic positions, often at\r\nprimarily-undergraduate institutions with active research participation programs. The current proposal will allow for the continuation of this tradition, and for the initiation of a new pilot program that will involve\r\nhigh-school students from the socioeconomically-challenged New Buffalo, MI school district in physics-related research.\r\nThis proposed research will also help in the development of instrumentation and techniques, together with\r\nfuture research personnel, that will be needed for the next generation of RNB facilities, and in particular\r\nfor the planned US-based Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA) . Finally, the development of precision high-\r\nfield, large-bore superconducting magnetic solenoids with special design features (such as light-weight, low-loss aluminum cryostats) has had and will continue to have an impact on technology transfer to US-built\r\ncommercial magnet systems used in a wide variety of important applications.",
