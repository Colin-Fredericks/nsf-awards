 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT for FRG award DMS-035472, DMS-0354465 and DMS-0354554 of Thomas, Seymour and Robertson\r\n\r\nWe propose to study the four-colour problem and its extensions. The four-colour problem\r\nitself was proposed as a conjecture in the the mid-19th century, and remained open for\r\nover 120 years, until it was settled by Appel and Haken in 1977. That period coincided\r\nwith the birth of graph theory as a serious subject, and graph theory grew up around\r\nthe various attempts to settle the four-colour problem. The problem lives right at the\r\nheart of modern graph theory, and still is not properly understood.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the proof by Appel and Haken used a computer, and for a mathematician\r\ntrying to understand what makes a result true, this is not acceptable; it may be\r\nconvincing evidence that the result is true, but it is not helpful for understanding.\r\nWe already found our own proof (joint with Sanders), and our proof is simpler and more \r\neasily checked than the Appel-Haken proof, but it too uses a computer. We plan to \r\nredesign the proof to reduce the dependence on computers as far as we can.\r\nThere are a number of proposed extensions of the four-colour theorem, mostly still open.\r\nFor instance, there is Hadwiger's conjecture of 1943 that every graph that cannot be \r\ncoloured with k colours can be contracted to a complete graph on k+1 vertices. For k = 1,2,3\r\nthis is easy, and when k = 4 this is equivalent to the four-colour problem; and we proved that\r\nit is also true for k = 5. We would like to extend this to higher values of k.\r\nThere are a number of other extensions of the four-colour problem, detailed in the proposal \r\nitself; for instance Tutte's 4-flow conjecture, the odd minor conjecture, and Grotsch's conjecture.\r\n\r\n",
