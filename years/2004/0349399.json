 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Abstract\r\nWarwick Anderson, University of California -San Francisco\r\nTHE POSSESSION OF KURU: EXCHANGE RELATIONS IN MODERN SCIENCE\r\n\r\nThis project explores the material cultures of modern by looking intensively at the case of D. Carleton Gajdusek's investigations of the disease of kuru, conducted among the Fore people of New Guinea in the 1950s and 1960s.  This focus is on the circulation of goods in global biomedical science.  This is a multi-sited historical study designed principally to describe and explain transactions involving local inhabitants, anthropologists and biomedical scientists, exchanges clustered around contested kuru material, principally brains, blood and corpses. The goal is to outline some of the basic features of the material cultures of late colonial, postwar scientific exchange, and to see how these material cultures structured and transformed the identities of transactors. The transaction of kuru material can help us to think more generally about the creation of value and the circulation of goods in global science.  In view of Gajdusek's later (1990s)\r\ninvolvement in the patenting of cell lines, this study will additionally present an\r\nunrivalled opportunity to consider how local exchange regimes of science may have\r\nchanged over the last fifty years, in particular to investigate whether science has become\r\nmore commodified and marketable. The study of the character of kuru transactions etches\r\nin especially clear relief the more recent global traffic of genetic material (including that\r\nproposed in the Human Genome Diversity Project). Moreover, the analysis of the\r\nchanging transactional orders of global science can serve to illuminate contemporary\r\ntensions between ownership and authorship in science, and prompts us to reconsider\r\nscientific authorship as an exchange function,  possibly now an imperiled form of\r\nexchange, not just as a writing process. This is essentially a historical study that\r\naddresses issues usually in the province of anthropology or sociology: it describes how\r\nscientific identities are fashioned in collection and exchange; it advances the analysis of\r\nthe material cultures of late-twentieth century science; it explores new ways of describing\r\nthe increasing global circulation of goods in science, and the creation of value in\r\ninternational scientific transactions; and it brings the Asia-Pacific region into focus in\r\nscience and technology studies as an important, but previously much neglected, location\r\nof scientific production and exchange. The outcomes include a monograph, a series of\r\narticles, and enhanced graduate student education.\r\n",
