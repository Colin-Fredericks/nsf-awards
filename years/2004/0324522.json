 "awd_abstract_narration": "Development of a Seismic Design Methodology for Precast Floor Diaphragms -- CMS 0324522\r\n\r\nPI: Robert Fleischmann, Arizona\r\nA consortium comprised of the University of Arizona (UA), the University of California San Diego (UCSD), and Lehigh University (LU), together with the Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute (PCI) proposes a collaborative research project to develop a comprehensive, accurate, and efficient design methodology for precast concrete floor diaphragms  in  buildings  under  seismic  loading. To  this  collaboration,  the universities  bring  knowledge  of  critical issues for precast floor diaphragms under seismic loads, as well as the required analytical and experimental expertise and  facilities.  PCI,  which  represents  the  precast  concrete  industry  nationwide,  brings  knowledge  of  industry practices,  standards,  and  economics,  as  well  as  project  co-funding.  Using  closely  integrated  experimental  and \r\nanalytical  simulations,  the  project  will  significantly  advance  knowledge  of  the  seismic  behavior  of  precast  floor diaphragms and develop information on the stiffness, strength, and ductility capacity of critical precast diaphragm elements. Integrating these results with industry knowledge, the project will produce an appropriate seismic design methodology.  The  project  is  proposed  to  the  NSF.s  Grant  Opportunities  for  Academic  Liaison  with  Industry (GOALI) program as an Industry-University Collaborative Project. The  development  of  an  appropriate  seismic  design  methodology  for  precast  concrete  floor  diaphragms  is challenging  and  addresses  several  critical  issues:  (1)  the  seismic  force  levels developed  in  diaphragms depend  on dynamic interaction between the diaphragms and the primary lateral force-resisting elements (e.g., shear walls and moment  resisting  frames);  (2)  the  dynamic  interaction  depends  on  the  elastic  and  inelastic  behavior  of  both  the diaphragms and the lateral force systems; (3) as a result of items (1) and (2), simple, accurate estimates of design forces for diaphragms are difficult to make; (4) the inelastic behavior of precast diaphragms, including the internal force-resisting mechanisms, and the deformation demands and capacities of critical elements, is complex and poorly understood  because  of  the  jointed  nature  of  these  diaphragms;  (5)  details  to  anchor  the  diaphragms  to  the  lateral force-resisting elements are needed; and (6) accurate methods to estimate the lateral drift demands on the building's gravity-force resisting systems due to the flexibility of precast floor diaphragms are needed. To address these issues, the consortium's research will integrate the  following: (1) large-scale experiments to determine the flexibility, strength, and ductility of critical diaphragm elements by applying both simple cyclic force patterns  and  histories,  and  complex  (multi-degree-of-freedom)  force  patterns  and  histories;  (2)  detailed  finite element  (FE)  analyses  of  complete  floor  diaphragms  (under  seismic  load)  to  determine  critical  force  patterns  and histories for diaphragm elements that will be applied in the experiments and used in developing diaphragm design requirements; (3) nonlinear time-history dynamic analyses (NTDA) of prototype buildings to determine diaphragm seismic force levels; (4) quasi-static diaphragm tests and shaking table tests of entire structures to verify the FE and NTDA  results  and  provide  added  input  into  the  large-scale  experiments  on  critical  diaphragm  elements;  and  (5) \r\nindustry knowledge of precast construction methods and economics, design practices, and design code development issues. \r\nIntellectual  Merit.    The  project  will  develop  new  knowledge  of  the  dynamic  interactions  between  floor diaphragms and the primary lateral force-resisting elements under the conditions where the diaphragm flexibility is not negligible and inelastic behavior of the diaphragm is likely. The project will also develop new knowledge of the inelastic behavior of precast diaphragms, which is complex owing to the jointed nature of the precast system and the flexibility and limited deformation capacity of  the reinforcement across the joints. To accomplish these goals, the project  will  advance  the  state-of-the-art  in  integrating  large-scale  experimental  simulations  with  analytical simulations, and this integration  will be accomplished across institutions,  with UA  providing the analytical simulations to drive experiments at LU and UCSD. \r\nBroader  Impact.    The  project  will  directly  impact  seismic  design  practice  and  codes  for  precast  concrete buildings.  The  interest  of  industry  is  evidenced  by  the  number  of  industry  participants  and  advisors,  and  PCI's financial  contributions  ($426,000)  to  the  project.  The  project  results,  when  deployed,  will  result  in  safe  and economical  precast  diaphragm  designs.  In  addition,  the  project  will  support  4  graduate  students,  who  will  be educated  by  the  research  and  the  interactions with  industry  practitioners.    The  research  results will  be  utilized  in graduate curriculum at the participating universities and in short courses for industry practitioners. \r\n",
