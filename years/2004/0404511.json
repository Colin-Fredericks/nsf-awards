 "awd_abstract_narration": "The subject of this proposal is to study the topology, geometry,\r\ncombinatorics, and statistics of such spatial configurations as knots,\r\nlinks, braids, and polygonal simple spatial curves. Five specific topics\r\nand related research projects are proposed.  They range from the knot\r\nclassfication problem, a folding problem of polygonal simple curves in the\r\n3-space, a possible statistic pattern of the roots of the Jones\r\npolynomial, some problems about representations of braid groups, and the\r\nstudy of higher order knot signatures. Some of the problems addressed in\r\nthis proposal are major open problems in the field of low dimensional\r\ntopology. The folding problem of polygonal simple spatial curves addressed\r\nin this proposal aims at showing that there is essentially no topological\r\nobstruction for the protein folding problem in molecular biology.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of knotting and braiding are fundamental in 3-dimensional\r\nspatial structure. A mathematical description and understanding of such\r\nphenomena is essential to our knowledge of the natural world, and is the\r\nmajor goal of the study of low dimensional topology. The discrete methods\r\nof analyzing 3-dimensional spatial structures developed in the study of\r\nlow dimensional topology are proven to be significant to many other\r\nbranches of science and applied research, particularly physics, molecular\r\nbiology, and computer graphics. In this proposal, a major effort will be\r\nspent on solving an abstract version of the protein folding problem, which\r\nis a central problem in modern molecular biology, using these methods.\r\nThese methods are also fundamental in the development of a student's\r\nability to visualize and analyze 3-dimensional configurations.\r\n\r\n",
