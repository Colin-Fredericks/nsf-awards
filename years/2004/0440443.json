 "awd_abstract_narration": "Motivation: Wireless local area networks have very promising commercial potential to be widely de-\r\nployed and used in a variety of application scenarios, but also suffer from a number of significant engineering\r\ndifficulties. For example, small cell sizes and unlicensed spectrum lead to sophisticated spatial interaction,\r\nthere is a lack of common air-interface to support mobile and time-sensitive applications, and interactions\r\namong competing users, both access points and mobile stations, could form surprising and unpredictable\r\npatterns. In addition, end-to-end transmissions in a wireless LAN often traverse a hybrid network, with\r\nwireless hops as well as wired links in the backbone. This presents unique challenges in cross layer TCP-IP-\r\nMAC-PHY interactions and offers new opportunities to optimize medium access control (MAC) and physical\r\nlayer (PHY) algorithms to enhance the end user experience.\r\nThere is no shortage of near term ideas from both industry and academia about how to improve the\r\ndelivery of wireless Internet services. What is missing is an optimization framework that captures utility at\r\nthe level of networked applications, and makes it possible to figure out whether any particular incremental\r\nchange at the MAC or PHY layer is positive or negative. The gap is the focus of this SGER proposal.\r\nKelly and Low have created the counterpart of this utility maximization framework in the wired world,\r\nand it has led to a deeper understanding of TCP congestion control and to the development and field\r\ntesting of the new 'FAST TCP' protocol by the high energy physics community. The key insight in this\r\napproach is to start with a given network protocol and ask: 'If this distributed protocol is the solution to an\r\nunderlying global optimization problem, what is that optimization problem?' The wireless world presents a\r\nvery significant challenge and the new framework needs to capture spatial interaction within a cell, operation\r\nin unlicensed spectrum, a mix of contention and scheduling at the MAC layer, and the flexibility of achieving\r\ndifferent rate-reliability tradeoffs by coding techniques.\r\nFor example, we know that TCP throughput can be improved through coordination of spatial resources,\r\nspecifically through space-time coding. Embedded diversity transforms spatial diversity into a fine grained\r\nresource that can provide opportunistic communication when the channel is good and reliable communication\r\nwith latency guarantees when it is less benign. We expect to see significant benefits in specific cross layer\r\ndesigns based on a completed framework of wireless utility maximization, but the value of the proposal is a\r\ngeneral proof of principle that can apply to an arbitrary wireless protocol or coding technique.\r\nProject Focus and Intellectual Merit: This SGER project is a proof of concept - the particular\r\nfocus is on modelling the medium access mechanisms and leveraging the new coding paradigm of embedded\r\ndiversity. The particular objective in the next 12 months of SGER investigation is to identify the global\r\noptimization problem to which coding (with embedded diversity) and scheduling (for medium access) is the\r\nsolution.\r\nPreliminary results have recently been obtained by the PIs on tackling interference in utility maximization\r\nproblems and on designing new space-time codes with embedded diversity. We believe that by filling in\r\ntwo remaining holes: modelling medium access and leveraging coding techniques, a complete and widely\r\napplicable framework of wireless network utility maximization will be completed at the conclusion of the\r\nSGER project.\r\nBroader Impacts: The research activities in this SGER proposal will be fully integrated with a variety\r\nof educational activities currently pursued by the PIs. These include curriculum developments of four new,\r\ninter-disciplinary courses at Princeton, two at undergraduate level and two at introductory graduate level,\r\nactive supervision of undergraduate research projects on wireless LAN, and student summer internships\r\nbeing arranged with our industrial partners.\r\nA unique and important aspect of this proposal is a detailed arrangement of close collaboration with\r\nfive major telecom and networking companies in the wireless LAN space: AT&T Labs, Cisco, Flarion\r\nTechnologies, Intel, and SBC. These interactions with the industry will further strengthen the research and\r\neducation components of the project and ensure visible impacts of the intellectual contributions.\r\nA workshop on wireless LAN research, development, and deployment will be hosted at Princeton by the\r\nPIs at the conclusion of this SGER project. We will compile a list of major research issues associated with\r\nwireless LAN and a list of industrial researchers or managers interested in these topics, which may be helpful\r\nto future NSF programs on topics related to mathematical models for wireless networks.",
