 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lipshitz and Robinson propose to continue their collaborative investigation\r\ninto the model theory of non-Archimedean valued fields with analytic\r\nstructure. The analytic geometry of closed balls over an algebraically\r\nclosed valued field, termed affinoid rigid analytic geometry, was developed\r\nin the 1960s and 70s by Tate, Remmert and others. Lipshitz and Robinson have\r\npreviously extended affinoid geometry to the setting, which they term\r\nquasi-affinoid, of relative affinoid geometry over an open ball. They\r\napplied that theory to prove rigid analytic quantifier elimination and\r\nquantifier simplification theorems that yield precise information about the\r\nstructure of sets definable by rigid analytic functions and their images.\r\nThey propose to continue this investigation. In particular, a central\r\nremaining question is whether there is a quantifier elimination theorem in\r\nthe affinoid rigid analytic category. They also propose to continue their\r\nrecently-begun collaboration with Raf Cluckers into uniform cell\r\ndecomposition theorems for (equicharacteristic zero) valued fields with\r\nanalytic  structure, extending the uniform algebraic cell decomposition of\r\nPas to the case of (equicharacteristic zero) valued fields with analytic\r\nstructure. In the discretely valued cases, the analytic  structure is\r\nprovided by affinoid power series and in the non-discretely valued case by\r\nquasi-affinoid power series.  Key is a generalization of the classical\r\nMittag-Leffler decomposition to 'analytic' functions on a generalized\r\nannulus with coefficients in a valued field with analytic structure that is\r\nnot necessarily complete or algebraically closed. Pas's algebraic cell\r\ndecomposition theorem gives results uniform in the prime p about the\r\nrationality of p-adic zeta-functions. This investigation will extend that\r\ntheory to the analytic category and will also have applications to motivic\r\nintegration. The methods to be used in the investigation come from model\r\ntheory, rigid analytic function theory, commutative algebra and algebraic\r\ngeometry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Archimedean property of the real numbers is the fact that any two\r\nnonzero real numbers are commensurate; that is, there is an integer multiple\r\nof the first the magnitude of which exceeds the magnitude of the other.  In\r\nvarious branches of mathematics, e.g., number theory and algebraic geometry,\r\nnon-Archimedean fields arise. These are fields with a notion of magnitude\r\nthat does not satisfy the Archimedean property: the magnitude of a sum of\r\nelements is no larger than the largest term of the sum. A natural example of\r\nsuch a field is the field of Laurent series (power series in one variable\r\nwith at most finitely many negative exponents) with coefficients in a field\r\nK. The nonzero elements of the coefficient field all have unit magnitude,\r\nand the magnitude of the variable is considered to be small (1/2, say.)\r\nPower series satisfy the implicit function theorem, a central property\r\nlinking the magnitude and the algebraic structure. Other non-Archimedean\r\nfields satisfy Hensel's Lemma, a generalization of the implicit function\r\ntheorem. A great deal of the algebraic structure of such fields is coded in\r\nthe structures of the residue field (the ring of elements of unit magnitude\r\nmodulo the ideal of smaller elements; in the example, K) and the value group\r\n(the set of magnitudes that occur; in the example, all integer powers of 2.)\r\nDefinable subsets over such fields can often be decomposed into finitely\r\nmany particularly simple pieces, called cells. This decomposition is very\r\nuseful in the evaluation of various integrals that arise in number-theoretic\r\nand geometric contexts. Lipshitz and Robinson propose to extend\r\nnon-Archimedean cell decomposition results and applications, which are known\r\nin the algebraic category, to the analytic category; i.e. to non-Archimedean\r\nfields satisfying Hensel's Lemma on which, in addition to the polynomial\r\nfunctions, a natural class of analytic functions is defined.\r\n",
