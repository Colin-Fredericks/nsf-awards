Santore\r\nInstitution:  University of Massachusetts Amherst\r\n\r\nTitle:  Patchy Sensor Surfaces for Selective Dynamic Adhesion of Micron and Submicron Objects \r\n \r\nMerit:  This program will develop the science for robust field-ready sensors for particles with \r\nsizes from 50 nm to 5 um, applicable to the detection of bacteria, spores, viruses, inorganic fines, \r\nand chemically-sensitive scavenging particles from aqueous and airborne environments.   \r\nFocusing on reversible dynamic adhesion as these objects flow over detector surfaces that \r\nspontaneously recover after a .detection event., the program targets a new sensing concept that \r\nwill screen and discriminate classes of biological cells or inorganic particles based on their \r\nsurfaces. This class-level selectivity will not require steps that lyze cells, extract proteins or \r\ngenetic material, or conduct molecular recognition. Multiple applications are therefore targeted. \r\n \r\nAt the heart of this new sensing technology lies a heterogeneous or patterned surface which is \r\nrobust to pH, temperature, and other environmental factors, and which selectively adheres target \r\nparticles while rejecting those outside target ranges in size or surface character (mean density or \r\nnanoscale distribution of surface charge, nano-meter scale patches of hydrophobic and \r\nhydrophilic chemistries, scale of roughness and other aspects of surface topography, and even \r\nspecific peptide sequences).  The sensor surfaces present nanometer-scale patches of different \r\nsizes and chemistries, and micron-scale hydrodynamic features that generate a landscape of \r\ncompeting colloidal and hydrodynamic forces to discriminate approaching colloidal particles \r\nbased on their dynamic signature, including reversible adhesion, rolling, skipping, and arrest. \r\n \r\nThe proposed collaboration between Santore, Coughlin, and Davis spans the disciplines of \r\npolymer interfaces, synthetic chemistry, and fluid mechanics. Through combined experiment and \r\nmodeling, the team will develop design rules for collector surface patterns, robust detector \r\nchemistry, and operating strategies that manipulate concentration, ionic strength, and flow rates.  \r\nWith model particles capturing the essential features of spores, bacteria, viruses, resins, and \r\nminerals, the program will probe adhesion and detachment rates on patterned collector surfaces \r\nwith systematic variations in the scale and chemistry of surface features.  Surface features will be \r\ndesigned with particular colloidal forces (electrostatic, Van der Waals, hydrophobic, and \r\npolymer mechanical) and hydrodynamic fields in mind, exploiting the versatility of block \r\ncopolymer architectures, and flow fields engineered to manipulate particle-surface encounters. \r\n \r\nBroader impacts.  The new sensing technology will benefit society not only in terms of \r\nhomeland security, but also in terms of public welfare: The sensing principles employ active \r\nsurfaces which could be produced at modest cost, and designs which can operate unattended and \r\nautomatically, in chemical processes and public buildings such as hospitals and schools, and \r\nultimately the home.  The program, while rooted in the interdisciplinary fields of nanochemistry \r\nand colloid science, impacts the fields of polymer surface chemistry, biophysics, and pattern \r\nrecognition, and will initiate a surface fingerprinting database of single cell organisms.  Graduate \r\nstudents will carry forward the bulk of the fundamental science while a liaison program will \r\nbenefit engineering, chemistry, and physics undergraduates via a hybrid industrial / university \r\nresearch experience.  Undergraduates will spend a summer in industry on a project with science \r\nparallel to that in the Santore / Davis/ and Coughlin labs, returning to UMass to conduct a related \r\nresearch project during the academic year.  Integrated teaching and research will be \r\naccomplished with a special topics course on smart interfaces, and with guest lectures in key \r\ncourses in the undergraduate curriculum of two UMass colleges.  The program will target \r\nunderrepresented groups by recruiting students from local colleges who take courses at UMass. \r\n\r\n",
