Henry Lamb\r\n\r\nInstitution:  \t  \t\tNorth Carolina State \r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to design and synthesize solid catalysts incorporating quasi-molecular organo-transition metal complexes within a silica aerogel matrix.  Co-condensation of tetraalkoxysilanes with sol-gel functionalized organometallic precursors will be performed in supercritical carbon dioxide.  Specific topics to be explored include:  control of the nuclearity and 3-D spatial configuration of the active sites, bonding of the metal centers to the aerogel framework, and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the aerogel pores.  A broad range of powerful spectroscopic techniques will be used to characterize the catalysts, including NMR, XAFS, and DRIFTS.  The catalysts will be examined for activity and selectivity in the metathesis of terminal, internal, and functionalized olefins.  \r\n\r\n Olefin metathesis has important applications in the synthesis of fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and there are new opportunities related to the conversion of biorenewables.  The project will provide an excellent educational experience for a female graduate student.  Dissemination of the results will be through journal publications and presentations at national meetings.  The ability to orient functionality will be a major advance and could transform this area of synthetic catalytic chemistry.  The principal investigator has chosen an important catalytic conversion to examine, and the potential industrial applications could grow rapidly if the project proves ultimately successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
