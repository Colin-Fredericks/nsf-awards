 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of the proposed instrument acquisition are to enhance the analytical capabilities and benefit ongoing and future research in the field of microbial ecology in extreme environments.  The capabilities provided by these instruments will aid in the integration of terrestrial, hydrologic, and atmospheric research within the PIs' university system, address environmental problems associated with microbial ecology, and enhance facilities and research programs for the benefit of undergraduate and graduate students.  Research made possible by the acquisition of these instruments includes chemotaxonomic and phylogenetic characterization of Antarctic pack ice microbiota, phylogenetic determinations of Bacteria, Eukarya, and Archea from ancient brine habitats, completion of several microbial genomics projects, evaluation of individual cell phylotypes and activities in ice environments, oceans, lakes, and travertine carbonate materials, evaluation of temporal and spatial shifts in taxonomic and enzymatic activities in freshwater ecosystems, and characterization of microbially mediated iron mineral transformations and elemental isotopic signatures reflective of microbial activity. \r\n\r\nUpcoming research exploring the relationship between the timing of sea ice formation and the seasonal movements of krill, fish, penguin, and whale migration will be facilitated by the acquisition of instruments capable of quantifying factors that have implications for changes in these movements, including characterizing pigment in microalgae, profiling the bacterial community composition, and determining nutrient status.  Quantification of accessory pigments will all for more statistically sound comparisons of microbial ice communities associated with early versus late forming ice.  Results of this research will have important implications for prediction of the effects of global climate change on the Southern Ocean ecosystem.\r\n\r\nThe instrumentation requested in the proposal will benefit numerous collaborative projects in the field and in the laboratory. The proposed instrumentation will also lead to significant educational and information contributions at several levels. The instrumentation will provide increased opportunities for training with state of the art equipment at the undergraduate, graduate and post doctoral level, and educational opportunities for younger students. Information from the research will be made publicly available through several outlets, including websites generated by the PIs and their collaborators. \r\n\r\n",
