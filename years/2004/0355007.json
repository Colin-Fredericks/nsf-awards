 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a three-year program funded by the NSF primarily to carry out\r\nexperiments with relativistic heavy ion-collisions, i.e. head-on\r\ncollisions of heavy nuclei such as gold near the speed of light. The\r\nprincipal investigators are T. J. Humanic and M. A. Lisa of the\r\nDepartment of Physics at The Ohio State University. The main goal of\r\nthese experiments is to obtain evidence that collisions of this type\r\nproduce a phase transition from normal nuclear matter into a new phase\r\nof matter made up of a large volume of free quarks and gluons (the\r\nconstituents of protons and neutrons) called Quark Matter. This phase\r\ntransition has been predicted by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is\r\nthe theory that describes the behaviour of quarks and gluons in nature.\r\nThus far, there have been no disagreements between the predictions of\r\nQCD and experiment, so finding Quark Matter would be a major test of\r\nthis theory. Quark matter is of additional interest since it is thought\r\nto have been the state of the universe several microseconds after the\r\nBig Bang and may exist today in nature at the centers of neutron stars.\r\nRelativistic heavy ion collisions could provide a method to produce\r\nQuark Matter in the laboratory since it is necessary to create a very\r\ndense and hot region within nuclear matter in order for the initiation\r\nof this phase transition. In addition,  because heavy ions are\r\nrelatively large compared with the size of a proton the collision is\r\nextended in time, hopefully allowing the system enough time to reach\r\nequilibrium so that the Quark Matter state is well developed. Thus, to\r\nstudy this phenomenon one prefers heavy ion collisions at the highest\r\npossible energies and with the heaviest ions available. In the present\r\nproposal heavy ion collisions will be studied with gold on gold\r\ncollisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven\r\nNational Laboratory (BNL) and lead on lead collisions at the Large\r\nHadron Collider (LHC) at CERN in Geneva. RHIC, which started delivering\r\nbeams in Summer 2000, is the highest energy heavy ion accelerator now in\r\noperation. In order to look for signatures that a phase transition to\r\nQuark Matter has taken place, one must study the properties of the\r\nparticles produced in the collisions, such as particle momenta and\r\nmultiplicities of each type that can be detected (e.g. pions, kaons,\r\nprotons, and more exotic particles). This will be done at RHIC using the\r\nlarge acceptance detectors of the STAR experiment, which can sample most\r\nof the interesting particles per collision. The information obtained in\r\nthis way can be used to determine, for example, the physical size of the\r\ninteraction region (using two-particle interferometry), the temperatures\r\nreached in the collisions (from particle momentum distributions) and\r\nexotic particle production such as strange baryons. In addition,\r\npreparations will be made to study Pb+Pb collisions at even higher\r\nenergies at the LHC with the ALICE experiment. The LHC will provide\r\nbeams 30 times higher in center-of-mass energy than RHIC, i.e. cosmic\r\nray energies, starting in 2007. Thus, the energy dependence of Quark\r\nMatter production can be studies and the search for as yet unpredicted\r\nphenomena can also be pursued.\r\n\r\nBesides the intellectual merit described above, there are broader\r\nimpacts to society of this proposal in the areas of education,\r\ntechnology and computing. Since undergraduate students, graduate\r\nstudents and postdoctoral researchers will play key roles in this\r\nproject, training will be provided to these groups in how to carry out\r\nresearch in large collaborations and in general problem solving skills.\r\nParticipation in particle detector development and testing will enhance\r\nnew technologies which can be adapted to both commercial and government\r\nuse. Since this research requires large-scale computing in order to\r\nacquire and analyze data on the teraflop an terabyte scale, new methods\r\nin information science, such as computing grid systems, will be\r\ndeveloped which can enhance the computing power of society as a whole.\r\n\r\n",
