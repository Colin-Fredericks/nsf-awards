Sullivan\r\n\r\nMuch progress has been made in symplectic geometry, and more \r\nrecently contact geometry, since the discovery\r\nof holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds.\r\nSullivan plans to continue calculating and applying \r\ntwo sets of invariants based on these curves:\r\nthe contact homology of Legendrian submanifolds\r\nin contact manifolds and the periodic Floer homology of\r\nRiemann surface diffeomorphisms.\r\nThe former is a special case of symplectic field theory.\r\nAlthough symplectic field theory is still not rigorously\r\nwell-defined, Sullivan and others have\r\ncompleted the foundational analysis for their\r\nversion of contact homology.\r\nSullivan will extend this alternative version of contact\r\nhomology to other manifolds.\r\nThe ultimate goal is to develop a complete obstruction\r\nof Legendrian isotopy classes.\r\nThe latter invariant is conjectured to agree with Seiberg-Witten-Floer \r\nhomology. This project will develop the foundations\r\nof this theory, as well as broaden the existing set of computations.\r\nThe investigator also hopes to work on applications of the periodic Floer\r\nhomology computations, addressing the problems of existence\r\nand classification of symplectic structures on 4-manifolds.\r\n\r\n\r\nSymplectic and contact geometry explain the\r\nphysics of certain dynamical systems, such as\r\nthe orbits of planets around the sun, the spin of a top, or \r\nthe motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field.\r\nSuch systems obey the least action principal, which\r\namong other things can mean that their total energy\r\nor momentum must be conserved.\r\nMany symplectic geometers study holomorphic curves,\r\na reinterpretation of the least action principal,\r\nwhich has linked together several independently well-developed\r\nmathematical fields such as complex analysis and differential topology.\r\nThe study of holomorphic curves has led to other\r\n``physical\" results, such as a generalization of \r\nHeisenberg's uncertainty principal.\r\nMore recently, these curves are thought to appear in\r\nother areas of theoretical physics, like string theory.\r\n\r\n    \r\n",
