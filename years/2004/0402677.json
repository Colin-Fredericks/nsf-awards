 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award to the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers Foundation (SHPEF) is to provide support for a Design Contest for SHPE Student Chapters for the purpose of stimulating the creative intellect of the undergraduate engineering students. The competition engenders a team environment and instills cooperation essential in a design project. The competition challenges each student chapter to design and make a formal presentation before a group of peers and professionals from industry, academia and government at the Annual SHPE conference. The competition is open to all student chapters, with preliminary designs evaluated by professionals in the field. Those selected to continue participation in the full competition are provided an industrial mentor and a resource package. Ten of the final design projects are selected to attend the SHPE Annual Meeting, where the teams make oral presentations and the top five teams receive recognition. This activity has a broad impact upon the students, the colleges of engineering, and industry by recognizing excellence in educational experiences, by recognizing contributions to strengthening diversity in engineering, by advancing higher educational goals for the students, and by creating the interaction between the student teams and industry\r\n",
