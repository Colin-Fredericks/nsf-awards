The main tools to be used are decomposition \r\ntechniques related to time-frequency expansions. Singular multilinear \r\npseudodifferential operators will be studied together with their \r\napplication to nonlinear analysis, estimates in Sobolev spaces, and \r\npartial differential equations. Another part of the project is \r\nconcerned with  the mathematical modeling of transformations of \r\nquasi-ordered geometries as measured by their Fourier spectra. This is \r\nmotivated by ongoing research in biology in the analysis of the \r\nscattering of light by nanostructures in the tissues of living \r\norganisms.\r\n\r\nA common task in both theoretical and applied problems is to find the \r\nbest way to decompose a complicated system in a way that efficiently \r\nquantifies observable properties and effects and keeps the available information in an organized and manageable form. Fourier analysis decodes such \r\ninformation by resolving a signal or function into a spectrum of waves \r\nof different amplitudes and frequencies, while providing also a way to study spatial order, structured geometries, and patterns in data. Combined with this analysis, multilinear approaches to complicated phenomena in nonlinear science will provide further understanding of problems where simple linear or first-order approximations are not sufficient. The analysis of ordered structures is also of importance to research in other areas of biology and physical sciences. For example, it is a relevant aspect in questions about the study of macroscopic physical properties of materials in terms of their microscopic structures.\r\n\r\n",
