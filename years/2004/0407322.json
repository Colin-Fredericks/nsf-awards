 "awd_abstract_narration": "WGBH is developing LAZYBONES (working title), a new television series for 10- to 14-year-olds, that is an engineering game show.  Each week LAZYBONES' eight players, aged 17-21, engineer easy solutions to life's arduous tasks.  The aim of the program is to use humor and irony to hook its target audience and turn them onto the creativity and productivity of engineering.  The purpose of the project is to (1) teach kids to learn about engineering by using science and technology to solve real-life problems; (2) help bridge the critical years for keeping kids interested in science and math, and; (3) improve the public image of engineering, especially among girls and minorities.  This grant is for the Test Video Development Phase of the project.  During this phase, WGBH will produce a test video in order to further evaluate and refine the concept, appeal and educational content of the show and outreach materials. \r\n\r\n",
