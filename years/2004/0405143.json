Taubes will mostly concentrate in differential\r\ntopology, but there are three mathematical physics projects of\r\ninterest as well.  The primary project involves the use of symplectic\r\ngeometry tools to investigate the differential topology of four\r\ndimensional spaces.  The long range goal is to shed light on the\r\nclassification for smooth, four dimensional spaces, this one of the\r\noutstanding open problems in low dimensional topology.  As there is\r\nconsiderable circumstantial evidence for a symplectic geometry role in\r\nthe story, the immediate plan is to probe the symplectic geometry\r\nconnections to the subject.  The first of the mathematical physics\r\nprojects aims to construct an equivariant Fredholm setting for a Dirac\r\noperator on the loop space of a manifold.  Such a setting would\r\nprovide a rigorous framework for various aspects of string-theoretic\r\nphysics.  The second mathematical physics project will study the\r\nminimal energy states for a Hartree-Fock approximation to the strong\r\ncoupling Hamiltonian for quantum chromodynamics.  The third\r\nmathematical physics project is undertaken jointly with a chemist; it\r\nstudies a version of free energy for a DNA molecule in a salt\r\nsolution.  The aim here is to predict the behavior of such molecules\r\nin various biological contexts.\r\n\r\nThe major project probes the possibilities for the large scale\r\nstructure of four dimensional universes.  For example, our universe\r\nhas four dimensions, these the usual three dimensions of space plus\r\ntime as the fourth; and astronomers have confirmed Einsteins\r\nprediction that our universe is curved at large scales.  The research\r\nseeks to provide a complete list of the possible large scale\r\nstructures for a four dimensional universe.  As of now, there is no\r\ncredible conjectured list for the possibilities, but there are clues\r\nto its format.  There are three other research topics that are\r\nmotivated by questions in mathematical physics.  The first of these\r\nseeks to confirm various conjectures from unified field theories in\r\nphysics for gravity and the subatomic forces.  The second topic\r\nexplores techniques for predicting properties of the strong force that\r\nbinds subnuclear quarks as mesons, neutrons and protons.  The third\r\ntopic studies equations from physical chemistry that predict the\r\nbehavior of DNA molecules in various biological contexts.  The goal is\r\nto develop tools to simplify the calculations.\r\n",
