In particular, the mathematical construction of exact periodic and solitary traveling water waves with vorticity will be proven, both with and without surface\r\ntension. Stability and instability phenomena will be investigated\r\nfor motions of ideal fluids and physical plasmas. Electric and magnetic effects on the stability of charged particles will be studied\r\nin the context of the kinetic theory of plasmas. Stability problems for a variety of other kinds of waves will also be explored.\r\nEnergy conserving waves of marginal stability, which occur in many of these scientific theories, will be emphasized. Methods of mathematical analysis are the primary tool employed in the investigations. The rigorous mathematics\r\nmakes it feasible to make stable numerical computations and to understand the\r\nqualitative features of the nonlinear waves.\r\n\r\n\r\nNonlinear waves are encountered everywhere in the natural world.  In this\r\nproject we study several kinds of such nonlinear waves that are well described by mathematics, but where the mathematical equations are extremely difficult to solve.\r\nOne of our objectives is to study water waves that may occur in the ocean, and to understand how they can form eddies or whirlpools and how they can become turbulent.\r\nThe knowledge of specific kinds of solutions to the mathematical equations has an impact on our fundamental understanding of ocean waves and currents. Another objective is to study semiconducting materials from which computing devices are manufactured.  We will analyze the basic equations that describe how the electrons can move inside and at the edges of the material. A third objective is to understand the behavior of charged particles in the vicinity of the earth's magnetic field, which affect satellite\r\ncommunications and the health of astronauts. A fourth objective of the project is the training of graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the precise mathematical analysis of applied scientific problems such as nonlinear waves.\r\n\r\n",
