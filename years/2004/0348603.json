 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe main objective of the proposed CAREER program is to engage and educate undergraduate and graduate students in the field of highly multidisciplinary BioMEMS research through integration of course development and experimental investigation stemming from micro SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance) sensor with integrated microfluidic components of which application is in-situ monitoring of biomolecular activities.\r\n\r\nThe SPR sensor has been emerging as a powerful tool to characterize various biomolecular interactions including antibody-antigen binding, DNA hybridization, protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. The proposed work will provide: (a) knowledge and tools for understanding design parameters in microoptics/ microfluidics and process variables in micromachining for the micro SPR sensor and (b) research experience to students who will explore interdisciplinary BioMEMS subjects. The micro SPR sensor will open new possibilities for miniaturized array type SPR sensors.\r\n\r\nIn this CAREER program, interdisciplinary subjects will be covered and disseminated through course development and outreach. Educational outreach for K-12 students, teachers and underrepresented groups is planned with a non-profit organization (Orlando Science Center), a local high school (University High School) and an on-campus organization (UCF Society for Women Engineers). Flash-animation based online content will be developed for younger audiences to overcome geographical limitations and to maximize educational impact.\r\n",
