 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Dennis Evans and his research group will investigate two-electron transfer reactions focusing on phenomena associated with the second electron transfer step.  Reactions that involve concerted electron and proton transfer (CEPT) will be of special interest.  Requirements for the CEPT mechanism including kinetic barriers and the acid-base properties of reactants and products will be investigated.  Dioxygen reduction, which has great relevance to life processes and technological importance through its role in corrosion and fuel cell function, will be among the systems selected for detailed study.  Reactions that involve potential inversion, the phenomenon where the insertion or removal of the second electron in a two electron process occurs more easily than does removal of the first electron, will also be studied as part of the major thrust of the project.  Related applied work involving electrochemical generation of bases for use as reagents in base-catalyzed synthetic reactions is also being undertaken.    \r\n\r\nThis research will develop fundamental understanding of multi-electron-transfer reactions. Modern electrochemical methodology will be employed.  Outcomes will be highly relevant to a wide range of areas.  Processes that affect biological systems, energy production, and synthesis of high value chemicals are a few examples.  \r\n",
