 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n     Millson and his collaborators will continue to explore the connections \r\nbetween the problems of constructing triangles in symmetric spaces and \r\nEuclidean buildings and problems in algebra of interest to representation \r\ntheorists. They are especially interested in the relations between the \r\nstructure constants of the spherical Hecke ring of a split p-adic group G and \r\nthose of the representation ring of the Langlands dual group. The two rings \r\nare isomorphic and have natural bases parametrized by the same semigroup \r\nS (the set of dominant coweights of G). However the isomorphism between \r\nthe two rings (the Satake transform) does not carry one natural basis  to the \r\nother. The change of basis matrix is triangular and was computed by \r\nLusztig. Thus it is a natural problem to compare the structure constants \r\nfor the same parameter values in S. One of the main theorems obtained by \r\nKapovich, Leeb and Millson is that if a structure constant for the \r\nrepresentation ring of the Langlands' dual group does not vanish then the \r\ncorresponding (ie for the same parameter values) structure constant \r\nof the Hecke ring does not vanish. The converse is true for GL(n) \r\n(by classical work of Hall, Green and Klein) but is false for other groups. \r\nOne of the main problems Millson intends to work on is the converse problem \r\nfor general G i.e if the structure constant for the Hecke ring is nonzero \r\nwhat can be said about the corresponding structure constant (or related \r\nstructure constants) for the representation ring.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Millson's work began with one of the first theorems of high-school\r\ngeometry - the theorem that three positive real numbers a,b,c are the \r\nside-lengths of a triangle in the plane if and only if they satisfy the\r\n\"triangle inequalities\", that is, each of a,b,c is less than or equal\r\nthe sum of the other two. It is a natural problem to try to give  conditions \r\non three isometry classes of geodesic segments in any homogeneous geometry \r\nthat are necessary and sufficient in order that one can assemble them into\r\na triangle. In the case of Euclidean and hyperbolic geometries a geodesic\r\nsegment is determined up to isometry by its length and three geodesic\r\nsegments can be assembled into a triangle if and only if the three lengths\r\nsatisfy the above triangle inequalities. However for many examples (e.g the \r\nnoncompact symmetric spaces of rank r larger than 1) geodesic segments are \r\nparametrized up to isometry by elements in a simplicial cone of dimension r. \r\nOne should think of a point in this cone as a \"vector-valued length\". It is a \r\nremarkable fact that there is a system of homogeneous linear inequalities in\r\na triple of such length vectors that give necessary and sufficient \r\nconditions for assembling three segments with these lengths into a triangle.\r\nMillson and his collaborators call these inequalities the \"generalized\r\ntriangle inequalities\". It is even more remarkable that the generalized\r\ntriangle inequalities give conditions that are necessary in order that\r\ncertain fundamental algebra problems in the theory of algebraic groups\r\ncan be solved. These conditions are almost sufficient as will be made\r\nclear in future work of Millson and his collaborators.\r\n",
