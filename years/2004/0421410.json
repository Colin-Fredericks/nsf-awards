The XRD will greatly enhance the research capabilities of the PI and co-PIs in the Department of Physical and Life Sciences in the College of Science and Technology. Examples of research projects that will benefit significantly from the requested X-ray diffractometer system include: (1) Investigations of (a) diagenetic processes caused by the occurrence of methane and gas hydrate and (b) the formation of diagenetic barite and silicate minerals in sediments from the Peruvian Continental Margin. (2) Mineralogical studies of authigenic seafloor deposits at sites of active submarine fluid expulsion in the Gulf of Mexico region to elucidate the geochemical environment at these sites. (3) Mineralogical analyses of cold seep carbonates to complement studies on the U/Th systematics of authigenic seafloor deposits from newly discovered seep sites in the southern Gulf of Mexico. (4) Quantitative and qualitative phase analysis of soil and sediment samples as part of the ongoing effort to study radon gas exhalation in the context of the reverse stratigraphy of the South Texas uranium mines.  The XRD will be available on a hands-on basis to students in upper-level laboratory courses, and thus will also positively impact educational efforts at TAMU-CC.  TAMU-CC is a minority serving and non-PhD granting institution and several cross-disciplinary research projects have recently been undertaken, with the goal to increase the number of undergraduate students, especially women and students from minority groups, involved in scientific research. These undergraduates participate in the research activities of the PI and co-PIs and are integral to our research program. Many of these students were funded through an NSF Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP) grant.  In addition to student research activities, X-ray diffraction analyses will be integrated in several undergraduate geology and chemistry courses (Mineralogy, Marine Geoscience, Advanced Organic Chemistry) as well as select graduate courses affecting up to 100 students per year. \r\n***\r\n",
