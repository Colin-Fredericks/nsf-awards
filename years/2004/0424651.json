 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long term goal of this project is to elucidate how the mutations affecting certain poly(A) binding proteins (PABPs) in the model higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana cause alterations in heat stress response and in plant thermotolerance.  The plant PABP multigene family is ancient, and its complexity is unparalleled in the rest of eukaryotic world.  Given their multiplicity and highly complex tissue-specific expression, plant PABPs possess a broader potential to influence growth and development than is apparent for other eukaryotic phyla.  One manifestation of this may be regulation of heat stress response by some of the plant PABPs.  The specific objective of the project is to elucidate the significance of the contribution of posttranscriptional mechanisms to this altered heat stress response regulation. \r\n\r\nHeat is a ubiquitous stressor that impacts crop productivity.  Therefore, this line of study may have important implications for agricultural biotechnology.  In addition, this project is a collaboration between a research University (University at Albany) and a small rural college (Hartwick College), and as such will make a significant contribution to training and education, through engaging undergraduate students at Hartwick College in collaborative research.  Furthermore, the educational component of this project includes developing plant genetics laboratory exercise for the Guilderland High School.",
