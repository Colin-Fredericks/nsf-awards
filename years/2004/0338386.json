Chu, Gordon Research Conferences\r\n \r\nThe Gordon Research  Conference on Colloidal, Macromolecular  &  Polyelectrolyte Solutions (CMPS) aims to bring together scientists and engineers from diverse backgrounds in Chemistry,  Materials  Research,  Chemical  &Transport  Systems,  Physics,  and  Biotechnology  to explore forefront fundamental and applied research involving the many  complexities of soft condensed matter in solution. New interests in such diverse areas of  research that rely on fundamental understanding of these complex systems have emerged.   \r\n\r\nThe  program  highlights  the  exciting  impact  of  colloidal,  macromolecular  and polyelectrolyte  solutions  on  nano-science/engineering.  Some  of  the  exciting  aspects  of  this emerging field  are the  new analytical techniques allowing measurements of properties  and processing of materials  on a molecular/nano-scale with great ingenuity  and precision. These experimental advances are complemented by theory and simulation to model even more complex systems with mathematical and  computational tools. We have combined a number of leading investigators (including two Nobel laureates: P.  G. de Gennes and S. Chu), who bring broad \r\nexperience  and  vision  to  the  program,  with  younger  scientists  and  engineers  who  will  present \r\nsome of the most recent innovations in the field.  \r\n\r\nOne of the key educational elements of this conference is to encourage and to financially support  young scientists/engineers at the beginning of their careers, especially senior  graduate students and postdoctoral students, to actively participate in the discussions and poster sessions. The program also plans to seek and to invite a number of new speakers (e.g., S. Chu from Stanford and D. Branton from Harvard, and G. Wegner from MPI, Mainz, to name a few), who have never attended this conference but have made recent breakthroughs, to present their new findings. We anticipate new collaborative efforts, student exchanges and visits shall result from such a conference. \r\n \r\n \r\n",
