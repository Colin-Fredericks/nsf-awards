 "awd_abstract_narration": "A three day meeting, Midwest Numerical Analysis Conference, is proposed to be held in May 2005 at the University of Iowa. This meeting will bring together researchers of all career stages and graduate students, mainly from the Midwestern area, who work or are interested in numerical analysis and applications. The purposes of the meeting are:  (1) to provide a forum to exchange new ideas and results related to research and teaching on numerical analysis, computer simulation, and their applications in engineering and sciences; (2) to provide an opportunity for numerical analysts in regional colleges to remain involved in research activities; (3) to expose exciting research topics to graduate students and recent doctoral recipients; (4) to encourage women, minorities and persons with disabilities to participate in the research areas.\r\n\r\nThe proposed Midwest Numerical Analysis Conference will greatly  contribute to the advancement of research and teaching on  numerical analysis, computer simulation and their interdisciplinary  applications in the Midwestern region of the nation, especially  in many of the regional colleges and teaching universities. The conference will serve as a forum to exchange, understand and  promote new ideas, results and techniques on research and teaching  in the areas of numerical analysis, computer simulation and  interdisciplinary applications.  Special efforts will be made  to ensure a broadened participation in the research and teaching  activities from students, junior researchers, college faculty, especially women, minorities and persons with disabilities.  The  conference will help to enlarge the personnel base of the nation  for next generation numerical analysts and computational scientists.\r\n",
