 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Drs. Nicolai S. Panikov (Stevens Institute of Technology, NJ) and Vladimir Romanovsky (University of Alaska Fairbanks) to establish a Microbial Observatory project in the Alaskan tundra. The long-term challenge is to identify, characterize and monitor over time and space the psychrophilic (ultracold-loving) microorganisms active in frozen ground likely to be responsible for recently discovered sizeable winter CO2 emissions in the Arctic. The particular goal of this 2-year 'proof-of-concept' project is to present convincing evidence that such microorganisms exist and can be studied by a combination of isolation and culture-independent molecular techniques. Growth and activity of psychrophilic microorganisms will be assessed from the in situ rates of carbon incorporation into cells and cellular constituents (DNA, phospholipids) in laboratory incubation studies. Testing of various substrates, temperatures (from 0 to -40 oC) and other growth conditions will allow the investigators to develop an optimized protocol for microbial enrichment, and to isolate 13C isotope-enriched DNA of microorganisms growing in frozen soil.\r\nAlaskan tundra was found to be an important trigger in recent global climatic changes: warming caused degradation of permafrost and stimulated microbial decomposition, converting the tundra from a 'sink' to a net source of carbon. The understanding, prediction and mitigation of the observed climate and atmospheric changes critically depend on knowledge of permafrost microbiology. Broader impacts of the research include more reliable climate predictions, insights into life on other planets under ultracold temperatures and development of highly efficient biocatalysts functioning at below freezing temperatures. To facilitate dissemination of information about this exciting effort, a web site will be established for the project.\r\n",
