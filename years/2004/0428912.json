 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the development of a computational toolbox for investigation of multiscale\r\nsurface processes that are central to nanotechnology as well as other current technologies. Two physical\r\nsystems will be studied that span from nano-scale phenomena to large-scale deterministic transport\r\nphenomena. The algorithms and software, developed to simulate and extract information from multiscale\r\nsystems, are generic over a broad class of problems, and will contribute well beyond the applications used\r\nin their development.\r\nThe physical systems include electrodeposition of metallic nanoclusters with additives to achieve\r\nspecific shapes, and environmental degradation through interaction of pits, crevices and cracks. The\r\nphysical systems, chosen for their computational structure, are characteristic of a large class of systems\r\nwhere controlled shape evolution is exploited to produce desired structures. Key issues are to understand\r\nhow small-scale surface interactions guide spontaneous self-organization, how to extract insight from\r\nnoisy data and uncertain fundamental understanding, and how to insure quality control at multiple scales\r\nin manufacturing.\r\nComputational tools will be developed for simulation and sensitivity analysis in multi-phenomena\r\nmultiscale systems that require methods for coupling of stochastic and deterministic models. Challenges\r\nfor deterministic simulation include the effective use of parallel computers, and dealing with moving\r\nboundaries, ill-conditioning and stiffness. We will explore classes of preconditioners for the iterative\r\nmethods that solve large linear systems of equations at each time step, in particular a newly-developed\r\nmultigrid method that is well-suited to moving boundary problems. Challenges for stochastic simulation\r\ninclude stiffness, which has only recently been recognized as a barrier to efficiency for stochastic\r\nsimulation.\r\nSensitivity analysis is an important part of this effort. For the deterministic computations, we will\r\nmake use of recently developed methods that are adaptive in space and time. We will develop new\r\nsensitivity analysis methods and software for stochastic systems, and couple them to deterministic\r\nsensitivity analysis for the physical systems of interest. We will facilitate the use of our toolkit by\r\nextension to larger-scale software systems of a recently-developed environment for the rapid creation of\r\nGUIs for scientific and numerical software.\r\nThis project addresses the National Priority Area of Advanced Science and Engineering (ASE), and\r\nthe Technical Focus Areas of Innovation in computational modeling or simulation in research or\r\neducation (sim) (primary), and of Innovative approaches to the integration of data, models,\r\ncommunications, analysis and/or control systems, including dynamic, data-driven applications for use in\r\nprediction, risk-assessment and decision-making (dmc) (secondary).\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe proposed project will impact the National Priority Area of ASE through the development of\r\nalgorithms and software to enhance the use of high performance computers in the investigation of\r\nmultiscale surface processes. The availability of such a toolbox will accelerate fundamental scientific\r\nresearch and engineering design in an area with the potential for large economic impact. Software\r\ndeveloped as a result of this project will be widely distributed in the scientific and engineering, computer\r\nscience and mathematical sciences communities.\r\nThe educational activities feature a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional approach to graduate\r\neducation. Students will work in multidisciplinary teams, with joint thesis advisors from a primary and a\r\nsecondary discipline. This approach has recently been undertaken at UCSB with some success; we plan\r\nto institutionalize this approach to graduate education in Computational Science and Engineering (CSE)\r\nat UCSB, and to export the model to UIUC. The model also includes industrial internships, career\r\ndevelopment workshops, and mentoring of undergraduates. Both UIUC and UCSB have been pioneers\r\nin developing graduate programs in CSE and have programs with a similar structure which will facilitate\r\nthe sharing of educational ideas and innovations across the institutions.",
