 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nThe project utilizes interdisciplinary case studies in two sequential analytical chemistry courses and incorporates the use of an atomic absorption spectrometer into the laboratory. The case study topics include environmental water testing, vitamin and mineral analysis, forensic science, and food science. The project builds on the foundation created by the interdisciplinary case study pedagogy from two National Science Foundation supported initiatives: Chemcases at Kennesaw State University and Case Studies in Science at State University of Buffalo at New York. Most case studies in chemistry are designed for students in an introductory course and only a few of the chemistry case studies include a laboratory component. The adaptation in this project comprises interdisciplinary case studies with an incorporated laboratory component for the Quantitative Analysis and Advanced Analytical Chemistry courses. The analytical chemistry undergraduate curriculum, particularly the analytical chemistry laboratory experience, has been redesigned.\r\n\r\nThe case studies meet the following objectives:\r\n\r\n1. Engage students by allowing them to gain experience with scientific inquiry.\r\n2. Provide students with an opportunity to develop critical reading and thinking skills.\r\n3. Allow students to develop effective communication skills on current and relevant scientific subjects.\r\n4. Enhance ability of students to work in groups.\r\n",
