 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides 15 scholarships per year for academically talented, financially needy students in Computing and Mathematics. It also provides student support structures, student research, departmental tutoring resources, and specific student support services that ensure the maximum likelihood of success for all CSEMS scholars. The program materials and dedicated web site provides current information on graduate study, internships, Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU), and careers. Faculty and administrators across Stetson actively support the goals and outcomes of this project.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science has a strong record of graduating qualified individuals who go on to reputable graduate schools or industry. All programs in the College require a yearlong senior research project, selected by the student and completed under the direction of a member of the faculty.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: Stetson's College of Arts and Sciences has prepared students for informed, compassionate, and engaged lives. The required curriculum in liberal studies develops breadth of understanding and serious engagement with principles of ethical decision-making.",
