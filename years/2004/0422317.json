 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research will address two different kinds of multi-object auctions.  These are auctions where the seller auctions off several units of a good at the same time.  The first part of the project is joint research with scholars in India and Mexico.  The goal is to determine how to design the rules for a multi-unit auction in a way that maximizes the money earned by the seller.  A second goal is to design rules for \"constrained efficient\" auctions, where the seller wants to maximize revenue but also wants to meet some other goal.  For example, if the seller is a government agency it might want to maximize revenue (since this benefits taxpayers) but also guarantee that small businesses are able to buy at least some of the units that are for sale.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the research will consider the conditions under which a decentralized multi-object auction where bidders each compete to increase their bids to win will achieve the same result as a \"Vickrey auction\".  In a Vickrey auction, a central authority collects private bids from all interested buyers and then announces the winner, who pays the second-highest bid.  This auction format has excellent incentive properties, but it can only be used when a trustworthy central authority exists to carry out the auction.  A decentralized auction does not require such an authority.\r\n\r\nAuctions have been used or might be used by various government agencies to allocate a wide variety of goods, including spectrum licenses, water rights, and energy.  This research will improve our ability to design the specific auction rules to meet policy objectives.",
