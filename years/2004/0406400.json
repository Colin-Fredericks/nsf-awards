 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to support a group at the University of Cincinnati to participate in MiniBooNE, the booster neutrino experiment at Fermilab. MiniBooNE will search for neutrino oscillations and will check a recent result from the LSND experiment that suggested anti-electron neutrinos could oscillate into anti-muon neutrinos. The neutrinos in the LSND experiment were produced by the 800 MeV proton beam from the LAMPF facility at Los Alamos. MiniBooNE uses the 8 GeV proton beam from the Fermilab booster. The difference in a factor of ten in primary beam energy will mean a ten-fold increase in the energy of the detected signal if the LSND signal is real. If the LSND result is due to an unknown background, it should occur at the same energy in MiniBooNE as it did at Los Alamos (a factor of ten below the region for signal events). A correct LSND result implies that MiniBooNE can expect about 300 oscillation events, a truly revolutionary result. In addition to the oscillation studies, the experiment will measure several neutrino scattering cross sections. The very good low energy neutrino beam and massive MiniBooNE detector will record a significant number of neutrino interactions enabling the measurement of the quasi-elastic cross section and a number of inelastic charged current and neutral current cross sections. Byproducts of these reactions could be a major background for the oscillation result. The MiniBooNE detector and beamline are complete. The first neutrino event was recorded in August 2002. The experiment is expected to collect data for about 3 years. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the research will occur at several levels: (a) Understanding how matter is constructed and how the forces of nature shape it into the myriad observed forms is a long standing question that resonates with scientists and non-scientists alike; (b) The research program poses a set of questions through which students and postdoctoral fellows will learn not only to frame crisp tests of the fundamental construction of matter, but also to devise innovative methods and tools for conducting them. Attacking such problems provides the rigorously educated young people that our society desperately needs; and (c) the proposal includes elements of outreach to the broader community. Since MiniBooNE is a relatively small experiment, there are many opportunities for undergraduates, professors from undergraduate institutions, and high school teachers to participate in the research in a meaningful way. Support provided by this grant allows a post-doc and a graduate student to serve as Fermilab guides to the public. The PI is the secretary of his local chapter of Sigma Xi and judges at local and statewide science fairs. \r\n",
