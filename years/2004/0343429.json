 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award renews NSF support for operation of the E. Coli Genetic Stock Center (CGSC).  The CGSC supplies mutant and wild-type strains of E. coli to researchers and educators in various fields of biology. CGSC maintains a collection of over 8,000 mutant derivatives of Eschericia coli strain K-12 and distributes about 5,000 cultures annually.  Over its 30-year history, more than 127,000 cultures have been distributed.  Demand for strains currently in the collection, as well as strains to be added, is expected to increase as the result of progress in understanding the details of the organization and function of the E. coli genome.  E. coli remains an important model organism, perhaps the best-studied from the standpoint of genetics and biochemistry, and serves as a critical tool in the genetic manipulation of other organisms.  Users include researchers working in academic and governmental laboratories, non-profit research institutes, and diverse industry laboratories, all of who rely on the CGSC for well documented strains and for online information about the organism and the collection.  Strains and information are also provided to teachers and students at all levels in universities, colleges, and K-12 schools.  As part of it's role in the research community, the CGSC coordinates assignment of gene symbols and allele numbers and encourages adherence to accepted genetic nomenclature.",
