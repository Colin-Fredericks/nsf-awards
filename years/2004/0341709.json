They will conduct both experimental and fundamental studies of microstructures, properties of corrosion/wear resistance, and heat/mass transfer analysis.  If successful, this research will contribute to fundamental knowledge about the stability and use of metastable mircrostructures and, possibly, new laser technology.      \r\n\r\nScope:  This collaboration will exploit complementary strengths of the UTK and IITK engineering colleges in advanced materials and processing.  The uniquely diverse expertise and knowledge base of those involved in this research (surface engineering, laser materials processing and structure-materials) will benefit students at both institutions.  The IITK is one of India's premier technological institutions.  The UTK has a strong track record of faculty participation in outreach programs to recruit minority and under-represented student groups and high-school students to enhance interest in science and engineering. The Government of India's Department of Science and Technology (DST) jointly supports this project under the NSF/DST program.    \r\n\r\n\r\n",
