This proposal is\r\nconcerned with regularity aspects of solutions to these equations. \r\nMost notably, the PI intends to develop new tools, as well as broaden the scope of more traditional methods, in order to be able to study how the smoothness of the data influences the smoothness of the solution, in the presence of boundary\r\nirregularities. The natural borderline is the case when the domains in\r\nquestion are Lipschitz, i.e., satisfy a uniform (interior/exterior) cone\r\ncondition. Informally speaking, Lipschitz domains make up the most general\r\nclass where a rich function theory can be developed, comparable in power\r\nand scope with that associated with the upper-half space.\r\n\r\nThe scales of Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces offer a natural functional\r\nframework within which the issue of smoothness can be analyzed. They\r\nencompass both the Sobolev and Hardy classes and, otherwise, exhibit\r\nfeatures which are generally harder to take advantage of (or are even\r\ncompletely lost) when working on the more classical Lebesgue scale.\r\nOne of the main questions addressed in this proposal is the regularity\r\nof Green potentials on Lipschitz domains (with Dirichlet and Neumann\r\nboundary conditions) on Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. The PI proposes\r\nto investigate this issue both in the elliptic and parabolic setting, via\r\nsingular integral methods.\r\n\r\n",
