As is the case in many undergraduate engineering programs, students at Ohio Northern University (ONU) currently have limited exposure to such systems.  ONU is working with a faculty member at the University of Notre Dame (ND) to adapt a graduate-level Intelligent Systems course recently developed at ND, and implement it as an undergraduate course at ONU.  In this course, consisting of classroom lectures and hands-on, multidisciplinary laboratory projects, students learn to model and control a variety of complex systems.   This course is designed for both mechanical and electrical engineering students who have completed a controls systems course.  As part of the course, ONU students are implementing an algorithm to control an experimental system at ND.  Likewise, ND students are doing a similar project to control a system at ONU.",
