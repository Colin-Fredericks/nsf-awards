 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies the variable selection problem in nonparametric smoothing and regression models. \r\nIn particular, a class of new regularization methods is developed for simultaneous variable selection \r\nand model fitting in the smoothing spline ANOVA models. One such method is the \"cosso\", which applies a \r\nnovel soft thresholding type operation to the functional components in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. \r\nIn Gaussian regression, the cosso selects the correct model structure with the probability tending to one \r\nunder certain mild conditions. To handle complex heterogeneous datasets with various types of responses, the \r\ninvestigator further extends the new methods to more complicated statistical models, such as generalized \r\nregression models, support vector machines, and proportional hazards regression models. Theoretical properties \r\nof the estimators like model consistency and the rate of convergence are investigated. Efficient numerical \r\nalgorithms and user-friendly software are developed for public use.\r\n\r\nVariable selection helps to reduce the dimension of model building, to improve the model accuracy, and to \r\nbetter understand the underlying mechanism that generates data. This research is motivated by the lack of\r\ntheoretical work in nonparametric variable selection and the limits of existing approaches. The investigator \r\nestablishes a unified framework for simultaneous variable selection and model estimation in smoothing spline \r\nANOVA models, and contributes new theories to related variational methods. This work broadens the traditional \r\nunderstanding of nonparametric smoothing approaches, and eventually will help to generate new methods in \r\nstatistical inference. In practice, high dimensional large datasets produced in modern sciences such as in \r\nmedicine and biology, often with tens or hundreds of variables, demand more sophisticated tools for dimension \r\nreduction and model estimation. The methodology developed in this work already has successful applications \r\nin some real problems, and it will potentially make a significant impact in various fields.\r\n\r\n",
