 "awd_abstract_narration": "The authors propose a conference on assessment in mathematics education to be held at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, during the month of March, 2004.  Participants will be drawn from the mathematics research community, together with researchers in mathematics education, psychometricians and school and district education personnel.  \r\n\r\nSessions at the conference will assume various formats, from individual presentations to panel discussion to small group discussion.  A volume of proceedings will be generated and disseminated.  \r\n\r\nThe goals of the proposal are to examine a variety of issues connected with assessment in mathematics education, including the effect of assessment on curriculum and instruction, issues of ethics and equity and questions of tools and methods for assessment.  An important outcome of the project will be the identification of research questions and directions for development of new assessment tools.  \r\n\r\n",
