In particular, he would like\r\nto study problems arising around the volume conjecture which\r\nconnects quantum invariants to classical objects like fundamental\r\ngroups, torsions, and volumes. Other problems involve integrality\r\nproperties (in broad sense) of quantum invariants and the\r\ntopology behind them, and their applications. The field has\r\ninteractions with geometry, combinatorics, number theory, and\r\nphysics.\r\n\r\nThe theory of knots and 3-manifolds is an old branch of\r\nmathematics which has gained renewed interest among\r\nmathematicians and physicists after the discovery of the Jones\r\npolynomial and its relation to theoretical physics (quantum field\r\ntheory, high energy physics). In fact, it is now one of the most\r\nactive domains in mathematics. Many results of knot theory may\r\nalso find applications in molecular biology. To classify knots\r\nand 3-manifolds, mathematicians use \"invariants\". This research\r\nproject studies new classes of invariants of knots and\r\n3-manifolds and their relationships with the classical ones. The\r\nnew invariants are very powerful in distinguishing knots and\r\n3-manifolds.\r\n",
