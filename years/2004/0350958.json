 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic Dynamics Program in the Chemistry Division, Professor Dmitry Rudkevich of the University of Texas- Arlington proposes to synthesize and investigate the activity of encapsulating chemical cages that trap nitrogen oxide species and can be manipulated through chemical design to catalyze reactions of environmental and biological significance. Professor Rudkevich proposes to use a series of calixarene-NO+ compounds as novel nitrosating agents for organic synthesis. The decreased reactivity of encapsulated NO+ will be used to achieve selective nitrosation. He will also examine the reactivity and rates of encapsulating nitrosating reagents in stereoselective and regioselective reactions with a series of alcohols, thiols, and amides. A systemic approach will be used to gain information on the reactivity and selectivity of new and modified reagents. It is anticipated that these principles will help in the rational design of specific catalyst with future applications to industrial and pharmaceutical syntheses.\r\n\t\r\nThe Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports Professors Dmitry Rudkevich of the University of Texas- Arlington who will demonstrate useful applications of NOx which is known to be a significant air pollutant. If the stated goals are achieved, Professor Rudkevich will expand the knowledge currently available in the field of calixarenes and nanotubes. The experimental and theoretical tools that will be used will give students exposure and hands-on experience in modern synthetic chemistry.\r\n",
