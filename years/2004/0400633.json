 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several central open questions concerning tight closure in positive\r\ncharacteristic, such as whether tight closure commutes with\r\nlocalization, and whether the tight closure of an ideal of a domain\r\ncoincides, in good cases, with the contracted expansion of the ideal\r\nfrom the absolute integral closure of the domain are proposed for study.\r\nAnother main thrust is to explore several notions of closure\r\nin rings that do not contain a field, such as finitely generated algebras\r\nover the integers, with the hope of extending tight closure theory to such\r\nrings, thereby solving many open questions.  A new approach to the\r\nproblem of proving existence of big Cohen-Macaulay modules in\r\nmixed characteristic will be pursued, as well as several lines of\r\nresearch aimed at solving the long standing and important question\r\nof whether regular rings are direct summands of their module-finite\r\nextensions.\r\n\r\nCommutative rings are abstract systems in which one can perform\r\naddition, subtraction and multiplication.  The integers and\r\nreal or complex numbers are examples, but there are vastly\r\ndifferent sorts of rings as well, including finite rings.  One\r\ncan introduce variable elements into any ring, forming a larger\r\nring.  Ring theory can be used to study the behavior of large systems\r\nof equations in many variables.  There are methods of transition\r\nfrom the study of equations with real or complex coefficients to the\r\nstudy of related systems with  coefficients in a finite ring.  These\r\nmethods produce qualtitative information about the solutions of\r\nthe original systems of equations:  sometimes one can determine whether\r\nthere exist solutions and, if so, what the dimension of the solution\r\nspace is.  Most of the problems in the proposal can be viewed as\r\nproblems about solving equations.  The projects in the proposal\r\nwill provide fundamental information about the nature of the\r\nsolutions for many sorts of systems of equations.\r\n",
