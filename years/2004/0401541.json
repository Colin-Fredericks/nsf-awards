The Particle Technology Forum of the\r\nAmerican Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) is co-sponsoring the Conference.\r\nPARTEC2004 covers all aspects of particle technology and includes contributions from throughout the world. This is a world event and provides significant opportunities for international collaboration. The encouragement of international collaboration is a significant driver for NSF travel support for U.S. faculty to participate in this conference.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nPARTEC is also an international contact point offering a compact survey of the complete particle technology field. There is a direct transformation of research results into practical use and an early feedback into research work and concepts. Limitations in the technology and knowledge bases are shown on the one hand and recognized on the other hand. Each participant gains of the results and discussions of his/her own discipline and of adjacent and new fields of research. The contacts with colleagues from all over the world are an added bonus.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact of Proposed Activity\r\n\r\nNSF funding will support as many as 25 U.S. faculty participants in the PARTEC2004 International Conference on Particle Technology. This support will provide a mechanism for international collaboration in the area of particle technology.\r\n\r\n",
