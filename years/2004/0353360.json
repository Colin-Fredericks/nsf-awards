 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Mathematics Specialist in K-5 Schools:  Research and Policy Pilot Study,\" a five-year Teacher Professional Continuum Research and Development on Models and Systems project, seeks to develop and test a statewide K-5 school-based Mathematics Specialist program.  The project is a statewide collaboration between Virginia Commonwealth University, the lead institution; Norfolk State University, a historically black college; the University of Virginia in Charlottesville; the University of Maryland and three school districts -- Portsmouth Public Schools, Richmond Public Schools and Stafford County Public Schools.  The centerpiece of the project is the preparation, support and deployment of two cohorts of twelve mathematics specialists through a graduate degree program and follow-up support.  The research component will investigate the efficacy of the mathematics specialist program on teacher change and student achievement.   A policy study will examine legislative, regulatory, and infrastructure needs and funding issues including a cost and benefits analysis related to the establishment of a statewide mathematics specialist program.   \r\n\r\nThe research design utilizes a stratified randomized control study.   The research examines the effectiveness of the mathematics specialists' program on teacher change, both specialists and classroom teachers, and student achievement.  Thirty-six elementary schools in three diverse school districts in the state of Virginia will participate in the study.  Participating schools are organized into triples with each triple residing in the same school district and having similar mathematics achievement and student demographics.  Within each triple, schools will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment categories -- Cohort I mathematics specialists, Cohort II mathematics specialists and a Control group.  Data analysis involves a mixed methods approach.  Student demographics, school demographics and teacher data will be used as control variables.\r\n\r\nThe project has the potential to serve as a national model for elementary school mathematics specialists.  The state endorsement of a mathematics specialist license enhances the timing of this proposal and underscores the relevance of the policy implications.   Project sustainability is addressed through the development of a statewide masters degree program offered by the collaborating institutions of higher education.  The involvement of an HBCU, Norfolk State University, addresses the need to diversify the teacher workforce.  An advisory board will give direction to the project that reflects expertise in mathematics teacher preparation and development, equity and diversity, mathematics educational research, design and implementation of courses and statewide collaborations.  An external evaluator will conduct both formative and summative evaluation.  Dissemination will reach a broad audience including policy makers, researchers and practitioners.\r\n",
