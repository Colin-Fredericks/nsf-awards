Baez\r\n\r\nThe 2004 Summer Program of the Institute for Mathematics and its\r\nApplications is on \"n-Categories: Foundations and Applications,\" to be\r\nheld in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the Institute's facilities at the\r\nUniversity of Minnesota - Twin Cities.  This award provides\r\nparticipant support to augment the summer program's membership and to\r\nmake it possible for a group of workshop participants to join the lead\r\norganizer and his students in a post-workshop working session at the\r\nUniversity of Chicago.  The proposal describes the emerging theory of\r\nn-categories as an area of international attention but of relatively\r\nlittle presence in the U.S.  The Institute's summer program and the\r\nsubsequent working session particularly aim to expose U.S. students\r\nand junior researchers to the variety of ideas on n-categories being\r\npursued internationally.  The post-workshop working group is an\r\nattempt to focus heightened energies resulting from the workshop onto\r\nproblems of greatest promise, as identified during the workshop, and\r\nis an innovation whose progress will be watched with interest.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical idea of a \"category\" is a versatile notion defined in\r\nthe mid-20th century to encapsulate the common features of a large\r\nvariety of mathematical objects.  Although abstract, the ideas of\r\ncategory theory are widely useful because they facilitate knowledge\r\ntransfer from one domain to another, for example, from algebra to\r\ntheoretical computer science.  At the end of the 20th century several\r\ncomplicated notions of \"n-category\" had come into play to meet the\r\nneeds of several areas of algebra, geometry, and physical theory, but\r\nwe do not have a definition yet of \"n-category\" that is as broadly\r\napplicable as the original idea.  The expository and research work of\r\nthe leaders of this summer program aims to achieve that missing\r\nsynthesis.\r\n",
