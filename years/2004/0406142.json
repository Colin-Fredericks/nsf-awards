This conference, ninth in a sequence, is tbe first\r\none with a mathematical biology theme.  The meeting brings together both\r\nexperts and novices in the theory and application of difference equations,\r\nand experts in mathematical modeling of biological systems.  In addition to\r\npresenting new results, they explore the role of difference equations in\r\nmodeling biological phenomena and the advances in difference equation\r\ntheory stimulated by biological models.  The conference features 14 plenary\r\ntalks and about 40 shorter talks.  Topics covered include population\r\nbiology, population genetics, mathematical ecology, epidemiology,\r\nasymptotic behavior, stability, and complex nonlinear dynamics including\r\nchaos.  Using the successful model implemented at the Society of\r\nMathematical Biology conferences, the meeting includes a mentoring program\r\nfor student and postdoc participants.  Special efforts are made to recruit\r\na diversity of participants from under-represented groups.  Proceedings of\r\nthe conference, including a session on future directions, are published. \r\n\r\nDifference equations are apparently simple ways to describe the changes in\r\na system from time to time.  They are analogous to differential equations,\r\nwhich include derivatives that describe the instantaneous changes of the\r\nvariables of the system.  Unlike differential equations, however, the\r\nchanges in variables of a difference equation need not be thought of as\r\ninstantaneous.  This makes difference equations well suited to model a wide\r\nvariety of phenomena that occur in distinct stages, such as changes between\r\ngenerations of plants or animals.  The principal investigator and his\r\ncolleagues organize a conference about recent advances in the theory of\r\ndifference equations, the application of difference equations to modeling\r\nof biological phenomena, and new mathematical questions about difference\r\nequations that arise in the course of this modeling.  Emphasis is given to\r\napplications in population biology, genetics, ecology, and epidemiology. \r\nThe meeting involves students and postdocs, including participants from\r\nunder-represented groups.  Proceedings of the meeting are published,\r\nhelping to disseminate more widely the results of the conference. \r\n",
