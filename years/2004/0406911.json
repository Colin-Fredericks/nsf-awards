 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"After-School Program Exploring Science (APEX)\" proposes to develop and implement a training model that will enhance the capacity of community-based after-school programs to provide science-learning opportunities for children ages 5-10.  Capacity building will center on expanding the human resource base as well as access to hands-on resources that enable investigative science in informal settings. \" APEX\" will create a series of engaging hands-on science investigations that will be designed for replication in a wide range of informal learning environments.  \"APEX\" community partners include the YMCA, YWCA and Family Christian Association of America (FCAA).  The Miami Museum of Science will also partner with Miami-Dade Public Schools, Florida International University and Miami-Dade College to formalize opportunities for paraprofessionals and pre-service teachers to meet a portion of their certification requirements by leading \"APEX\" Science investigations in after-school programs thereby providing community-based after-school programs with a more stable workforce while at the same time supporting future teachers in the development of inquiry-based teaching skills.  Through \"APEX\" over 275 after-school provider staff will be trained along with up to 300 pre-service teachers and paraprofessionals.  The project will work with 93 after-school programs and impact roughly 7,000 high-need students.",
