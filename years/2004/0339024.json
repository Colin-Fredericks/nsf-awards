 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project aims to create an Advanced Virtual Manufacturing Lab (AVML).  The AVML will be driven by an object-oriented scene-graph virtual reality toolkit.  The key elements of the AVML are as follows:  (1) textured photo-realistic geometric solid models of the machines and lab; (2) digital model of the machine which includes the machines controls and moving parts; (3) physics-based model of the machining operation; and (4) natural-language human-like intelligent agents which can be used as tutors.  Applications of AVML include the following:  allowing students and researchers to view and interact with a physically accurate simulation of the manufacturing machine, training students to operate the manufacturing machines in a sage environment, optimization of the manufacturing process plan by testing various plans on the virtual machine before machining on the physical machine, and remote viewing and control of the physical manufacturing machines.\r\n\r\nThe AVML will enhance the quality, accessibility, and productivity of manufacturing education and training and will advance scientific discovery and engineering analysis of next generation manufacturing processes.  Also, the AVML will enhance experimentation and learning, increase student creativity and problem-solving capability, enhance collaboration among students, teachers, and industry experts, and promote participation and equal access of underrepresented groups to manufacturing technology training.\r\n",
