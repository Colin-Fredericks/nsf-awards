 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit- Ceratopsians are among the best known of dinosaur clades due to their\r\nrelative abundance, and the remarkable diversity of cranial synapomorphies such as horns\r\nand frills that diagnose more derived members of the clade. Gigantism is a trend in\r\nceratopsian evolution that is accompanied by the evolution of progressively more\r\ncomplex feeding mechanisms and cranial display diversity. Heterochrony, and in\r\nparticular peramorphosis have been proposed as major influences in ceratopsian\r\nevolution to explain the evolution towards large size and late ontogenetic genesis of the\r\ndisplay in advanced forms. Likewise, the apparent hierarchical complexity of the feeding\r\napparatus suggests an evolution of character integration through both ontogeny and\r\nphylogeny. All of these evolutionary hypotheses require detailed knowledge of both the\r\ndevelopment and phylogeny of ceratopsian dinosaurs, but so far age estimates have been\r\npoorly constrained and non-quantified and rigorous reliance on detailed phylogenies\r\nlimited.\r\nIn this study, an innovative approach to developmentally staging fossils based on\r\nhistological sectioning and Developmental Mass extrapolation is combined with novel\r\ntree-based methods toward studying heterochrony and integration using a well-\r\nestablished phylogeny of Ceratopsia. Based on well-sampled growth series of seven\r\n-backbone taxa representing the diversity of the clade, and a detailed phylogeny of\r\nceratopsians, we will examine whether there are correlated shifts in developmental timing\r\nof synapomorphies (heterochrony) relative to growth strategies, and also if blocks of\r\ncharacters represent integrated modules that fulfill criteria for being phylogenetically and\r\nontogenetically constrained. These quantitative studies will allow us to evaluate previous\r\nhypotheses on the role heterochrony and integration have played in ceratopsian evolution.\r\nBy providing a quantified understanding of when in ontogeny synapomorpies are\r\nexpressed this research will help to resolve several taxonomic quandaries related to the\r\nvalidity of species based on juvenile holotypes and provide a more accurate\r\nunderstanding of ceratopsian diversity.\r\nBroader Impact: This research represents a new integrative exploration of evolutionary\r\nprocesses in a well-known group of dinosaurs. The novel methods and the results of this\r\nresearch promise to be widely applicable to fields as diverse as population biology,\r\ndevelopmental biology, macroevolution and evo-devo, and will be disseminated through\r\npeer -reviewed journals, presentations at professional meetings and professional web-\r\nsites. Two graduate and two undergraduate students will be trained through this project,\r\nand aspects of the research will be incorporated into university courses taught by both\r\nPIs. Both PIs are involved with developing exhibits for natural history museum, and\r\nparts of this research will be incorporated into two ongoing exhibit projects, and\r\nassociated educational web-sites and programming. Given the media interest in dinosaur\r\nresearch, many opportunities to disseminate results of this work to the public will no\r\ndoubt arise.",
