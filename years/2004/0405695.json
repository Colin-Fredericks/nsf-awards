Minicozzi, Johns Hopkins University\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nWe will continue our investigations on minimal surfaces and related \r\nareas of geometric analysis, including geometric evolution equations such as the mean\r\ncurvature and Ricci flow, and on function theory.  Some of our\r\nmain results for minimal surfaces so far - the lamination theorem\r\nand the one-sided curvature estimate - are for properly embedded\r\nminimal disks.  Recent years have seen  breakthroughs on many long--standing\r\nproblems in the  theory of minimal surfaces, with important\r\ncontributions from many mathematicians.  The lamination theorem\r\nand the one-sided curvature estimate described here have played a\r\nkey role and have been used by many people.  Two of the important new \r\ndirections are removing the assumption of properness and considering \r\nminimal surfaces with more general topological types.  These results will \r\nhave important implications.  \r\n \r\nThe field of minimal surfaces dates back to early work of Euler in\r\n1744 and Lagrange in 1762 and has remained a vibrant area of research\r\nfor the last 250 years.  Minimal surfaces appear frequently throughout science, \r\ndating back at least to the soap film experiments of the Belgian physicist Plateau \r\nin the first half of the nineteenth century.  Their mathematical impact has been \r\nsignificant and has led to developments in geometry, topology, and partial differential \r\nequations.   The subject has seen major developments recently, including answers \r\nto some long-standing open questions and a rather complete picture for properly \r\nembedded minimal disks (such as the helicoid which was originally discovered in\r\n1776).  However, much less is known when these assumptions are removed; \r\nunderstanding this is a key part of our research and the answers are likely \r\nto lead to further developments.\r\n",
