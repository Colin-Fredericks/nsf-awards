This travel grant will support approximately 15 US researchers, including student, young and under-represented group members and US-PRC Earthquake Protocol Program grantees to attend the conference.  The conference is expected to lead to collaborative research between US and PRC researchers in the areas of earthquake engineering, structural health monitoring, sensors technology, and structural control. Technology transfer through test-beds, exchange of research data and training of students and researchers across the borders is also likely.\r\n",
