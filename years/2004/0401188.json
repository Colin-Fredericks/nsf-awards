 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced Signal Processing for Ultra-Wide-Band (UWB) Communications in Wireless Networks\r\n\r\nFollowing the February 2002 order by the Federal Communications Commission, ultra-wide-\r\nband (UWB) communications technology has emerged as the leading standard for very high data\r\nrate applications in wireless networks. The technology will allow the wireless connection of multiple\r\ndevices at very high rates and at low power consumption. UWB will allow the transmission of\r\nvideo, audio, and other data traffic among devices at rates that may reach 480Mbps. For example,\r\nUWB could stream real-time video content from a PC or a consumer electronics device, such as\r\na camcorder, a DVD player or a personal video recorder, to a flat-screen HDTV display without\r\nthe need for wires. In order for this technology to become widely adopted it is necessary to\r\nmaintain the costs of UWB devices low. A major challenge arises from the signal distortions\r\nthat are introduced during the analog processing as a result of manufacturing imperfections. The\r\neffects of such distortions will be compounded in future high-performance wireless networks due\r\nto the higher silicon integration, lower power consumption, larger bandwidth, and higher carrier\r\nfrequency. There are at least two strategies to address this diffculty. One strategy is generally\r\ncostly and relies on building more reliable front-end radios. The second strategy, which is one of\r\nthe objectives of this proposal, is to model and cancel signal distortions by using advanced signal\r\nprocessing and compensation algorithms in the digital domain. This research proposes a systematic\r\nway for modeling distortion effects, exploiting the distortion models in receiver design, developing\r\nenhanced OFDM receivers that counter-balance the effects of distortions and that improve the\r\nrange of UWB devices, investigating theoretical limits of performance, and also implementing and\r\ntesting the developed algorithms on an FPGA testbed.\r\nObjectives. (1) Develop distortion models and distortion cancellation techniques for UWB de-\r\nvices by using advanced signal processing algorithms in the digital domain. (2) Develop enhanced\r\nOFDM receivers for UWB communications by jointly addressing the issues of improved range,\r\nimproved channel estimation, and distortion compensation. (3) Use the developed distortion can-\r\ncellation receivers for both single user and multi-user (space-time coded) communications scenarios.\r\n(4) Investigate theoretical limits of performance and effects of distortion on system performance. (5)\r\nPursue a proof-of-concept implementation of a UWB system on an FPGA by using the developed\r\nalgorithms in order to investigate the models and the algorithms for improved performance.\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity. The PI and his research group have extensive research\r\nexperience on different aspects of advanced signal processing, communications, and adaptive system\r\ndesign. The proposed research activity is creative in several respects: (1) It recognizes the need to\r\naddress signal distortions introduced by analog processing as a step towards maintaining the cost\r\nof UWB devices low. (2) It recognizes the importance of cancelling distortion in the digital domain,\r\nas opposed to the analog domain. (3) It studies the effects of major sources of distortion (including\r\nIQ imbalances, phase noise, and transmitter and receiver nonlinearities) on algorithm development\r\nand performance. (4) It addresses major performance hurdles such as enhanced channel estimation\r\nin order to incorporate distortion models, the design of distortion-robust OFDM-based SISO and\r\nMIMO (space-time coded) communications, and the need for improved range for UWB devices due\r\nto their limited transmit power. (5) It pays attention to the intricate balance between algorithm\r\ncomplexity and hardware implementation.\r\nBroader Impacts of the Proposed Activity. The broader impacts of the proposed research are\r\nas follows: (1) It has significant implications on the information technology infrastructure of the\r\nnation by making the promising UWB technology widely spread at lower costs. (2) It contributes\r\nto the development of ultra-high-speed wireless networks for PC peripherals, consumer electronics,\r\nhome networking, and mobile devices at data rates that may reach 480Mbps. (3) It trains both\r\ngraduate and undergraduate students in an area of fundamental relevance to future communications\r\nsystems. (4) The results of the research will be widely disseminated online and via publications in\r\narchival journals and conference proceedings, and also via demonstrations of the hardware testbed.\r\nA-1",
