Such data\r\nare common in nearly all fields including the biological, medical, neural,\r\nphysical and social sciences, but are termed differently, with\r\n\"longitudinal data\" being the preferred term in health and social sciences\r\nand \"functional data\" being the preferred term in engineering and physical\r\nsciences. Statistical approaches to analyze such data are also\r\nintrinsically different in the longitudinal and functional data research\r\ncommunities. Parametric approaches such as GEE and GLMM are\r\npredominantly used methods to analyze longitudinal data, while\r\nnonparametric approaches play the analogous role for functional\r\ndata.  Due to the limitations of each approach, semiparametric models\r\ncombining longitudinal and functional data analysis methods emerge as a\r\npromising alternative, which can bring out and combine the best aspects of\r\nthe two approaches. Longitudinal or functional data are intrinsically\r\ncomplex owing to irregularity of observational times, dependence of\r\nobservations within subjects, sparsity and size of the data.  They pose\r\nchallenges both on the computational and theoretical fronts.  This\r\nproposal aims at bringing together methodology from various areas in\r\nstatistics, including nonparametric smoothing, multivariate statistics,\r\nrandom and mixed effects models, dimension reduction and robustness, to\r\naddress several challenging issues and to provide flexible modeling and\r\nefficient implementation for longitudinal/functional data.  The proposed\r\nmethods range from extension of traditional linear models to new\r\nsemiparametric and nonparametric models, and focus particularly on\r\nhandling sparse longitudinal data with or without measurement error.  A\r\nnew version of functional principal components (PCA) analysis was\r\ndeveloped recently by the PI and collaborators, where the functional\r\nprincipal component scores are framed as conditional expectations. This\r\nextends the applicability of functional PCA to typical situations in\r\nlongitudinal data analysis, where only few repeated measurements are\r\navailable per subject. This approach is known as Principal Components\r\nAnalysis through Conditional Expectation (PACE) for longitudinal data.\r\nWith PACE serving as the backbone, the proposal includes three projects:\r\n(1) Modeling covariate effects, (2) Semi-parametric dimension reduction\r\napproaches, and (3) Robust covariance estimation and functional PCA.\r\n\r\nIn addition to new methodology, statistical theory will be a major focus\r\nto establish formal inference procedures. So far, theoretical results\r\nfor functional data are scattered and this proposal aims to fill the gaps.\r\nThe proposed research is motivated by ongoing interdisciplinary research\r\ncollaborations of the PI with biologists and physicians.  The new\r\napproaches are applied to data generated from these ongoing and future\r\ncollaborations.  The proposed research helps to better understand the\r\nrelationship between reproductive activity and longevity and will\r\ncontribute to the growing fields of aging research and biodemography. As\r\nthe procedures developed will be applicable to general longitudinal or\r\nfunctional data from other disciplines, they will provide much needed\r\nmodern statistical tools to analyze such data, which in turn will\r\nfacilitate the advancement of many scientific fields.  Moreover, with the\r\nfast rising trend towards the collection of such large and complex data\r\nsets, there is a shortage of Ph.D. statisticians trained to handle such\r\ndata. The research assistantship provides a training\r\nopportunity to address this need. The PI is engaged in\r\nundergraduate research training, and continues this activity in\r\naddition to the dissemination of the new research findings through\r\nteaching, training, and the web.\r\n",
