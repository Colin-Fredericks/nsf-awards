 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor R. Lee Penn of the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program and the Geology and Paleontology program to investigate the formation of crystalline, nanometer-scale, transition metal oxides and hydroxides through the mechanism of oriented aggregation.  This mechanism involves the assembly of primary crystals by attachment through specific crystallographic planes.  Emphasis is on the control of orientated aggregation through manipulation of crystal surface properties.  In addition to nanoparticle growth, chemical properties of these materials are probed through the study of dissolution and redox reactions.  Particle structure is determined primarily by x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy and photon correlation spectroscopy measurements.  Professor Penn is also developing a program for middle school students and science educators designed to enhance awareness of the structure of materials at the atomic level.  Laboratory exercises that center on crystal growth and characterization are implemented to assist students and educators in understanding relationships between the macroscopic properties of materials and the underlying atomic level structure.  \r\n\r\nStudies of inorganic oxide crystal growth and crystal decomposition through dissolution and redox reactions is providing insights into processes that affect the natural environment through atmospheric and geological chemistry.  The education plan is providing learning opportunities for middle school age students and educators to enhance awareness of relationships between bulk materials properties and atomic level structure.  \r\n",
