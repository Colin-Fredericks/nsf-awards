 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will continue the operation of surface-based magnetometers,  imaging and broadbeam riometers (relative ionospheric opacity instruments), and two-wavelength zenith photometers at South Pole and McMurdo stations in Antarctica, and imaging riometers at Iqaluit (nominally conjugate to South Pole) and Sondrestrom in the Arctic.  Additionally, the data acquisition systems at South Pole and McMurdo for the common recording of other geophysical data, and the provision of these data to collaborating investigators will be continued.  The Antarctic data sets are web-based, and can be accessed in near-real time. \r\nThe continuation of the activities in the 2004-2006 time frame will contribute to several major science initiatives, including the GEM (Geospace Environment Modeling), CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions), ISTP/GGS (International Solar-Terrestrial Project/Global Geospace Science), and National Space Weather programs.  The overall objective of the project is to understand the relevant physical processes that produce the observed phenomena, and how they relate to driving forces, either internal, such as magnetospheric/ionospheric instabilities, or external, such as solar wind/interplanetary magnetic field variations. It is expected that this project will lead to an enhanced capability to predict sufficiently in advance the possible occurrence of events that might have negative technological or societal impacts, and thus provide time to lessen their effects. \r\n",
