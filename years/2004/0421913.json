 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University is acquiring research computing equipment dedicated to support of research in the mathematical sciences.  The main items to be purchased include: (1) high-bandwidth low-cost storage optimized for use with the Lustre file system and existing Linux clusters, (2) high-speed network components to support trunked-ethernet communications between the compute nodes, storage, and graphics systems, (3) high-end Linux client PCs for data analysis and visualization, and (4) a small computer experimental facility to support collection and analysis of neural spike-train data for the mathematical modeling and statistical analysis of biological vision.  The computing equipment will be used to carry out the research of NSF-sponsored projects in numerical methods for partial differential equations, mathematical modeling in brain science, and statistical procedures in experimental neuroscience. \r\n\r\nThe research in applied mathematics is closely tied to applications in engineering, physics, and the life sciences.  The NSF-sponsored research focuses on development of new mathematical and statistical methods designed for the application areas.  For example, some of the work on computational methods for engineering is motivated by the need to design stealth aircraft.  Also, the research on new statistical methods is needed for the advancement of brain science, to understand how information is encoded in neural spike trains.  The computer equipment provided by this grant is crucial for the ability of faculty and students to create these new mathematical and statistical methodologies.\r\n",
