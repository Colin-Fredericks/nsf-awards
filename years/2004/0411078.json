 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biology (61) This CCLI A&I project creates a capstone experience for biology majors that reinforces the institution's goal of preparing biology students with the knowledge, skills, and courage needed to act responsibly as global citizens.  The project consists of a two-semester sequence of courses that builds research skills and stimulates independent research, with student initiatives having the potential of being transformed into workable, community-backed conservation plans.  Biochemistry is the first course in the sequence.  Adapted from a laboratory directed by Janet Anderson at the University of Minnesota, it targets hypothesis development, primary literature synthesis and comprehension, and acquisition of commonly used molecular laboratory techniques and procedures.  In the second course, Evolution, students are guided through a semester-long research project in which students apply their biochemistry skills to questions regarding the population genetics of mammals such as the fisher (Martes pennanti).  An adaptation of a project-based, cooperative, student-directed course in cell biology at the University of Washington, the course also emphasizes leadership and collaborative research skills.  Students apply knowledge across these courses and synthesize their understanding of molecular and cellular level processes upwards to population and evolutionary processes.  The sequence involves a fundamental re-organization of the courses' laboratory experiences, connecting a more traditional lecture with non-traditional laboratory, and tying the two courses into a coherent sequence of learning goals.  These modifications are designed to increase students' active engagement in learning and to better prepare students for independent undergraduate and graduate research.",
