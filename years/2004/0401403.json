 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for award DMS-0401403  of  Flach\r\n\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to explore the usefulness of Taylor-Wiles systems \r\nfor establishing cases of the Tamagawa number conjecture on special values \r\nof Hasse-Weil L-functions. Following the initial breakthrough by Taylor and \r\nWiles this has been done in the case of the adjoint L-function of elliptic \r\nmodular forms in joint work with Diamond and Guo. The next cases we intend \r\nto look at are those where the Taylor-Wiles method has been worked out but \r\nthe relationship to values of L-functions is still missing, notably Siegel \r\nmodular forms of genus 2, Hilbert modular forms and possibly unitary groups.\r\n\r\nL-functions figure prominently in modern number theory, or even in all of \r\npure mathematics if one takes as a benchmark the seven Clay millenium \r\nproblems, two of which are directly concerned with L-functions. In high \r\nschool algebra one draws the solution set in the plane of an algebraic \r\nequation in two variables x and y. One may also look at the solutions in \r\nrational numbers, integers or integers modulo a prime number. L-functions \r\nare built from the number of solutions modulo primes (of any set of \r\nequations in any number of variables) and are expected to give information \r\nabout solutions in rational numbers. Solving equations in rational numbers \r\nis notoriously hard, whereas values of L-functions are often very \r\ncomputable, so such a relationship lies very deep. The primordial example \r\nis of course the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, one of the \r\nmillenium problems. As often in mathematics, one generalizes a problem in \r\norder to understand it better but the tradeoff is an increasingly abstract \r\nframework (\"cohomology\" in this case). On the positive side, other \r\ninstances of the generalized framework may actually be provable with \r\ncurrent methods, and this is what the project aims to explore. The aim is \r\nto prove new cases of the expected special value formula for L-functions, \r\nusing the relatively recent method of Taylor-Wiles systems.\r\n\r\n",
