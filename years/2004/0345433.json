 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in mass-spectrometric techniques and instrumentation have enabled\r\naccurate stable isotope measurements of many heavy elements. In order to realize the full\r\npotential of these new measurements, it is important to develop a thorough understanding of the\r\nbasic mechanisms causing heavy-element isotopic fractionation through careful theoretical\r\nstudies and laboratory experiments. Here, a systematic theoretical exploration of the equilibrium\r\nstable isotope geochemistry of the alkaline-earth elements (magnesium, calcium, strontium, and\r\nbarium) is proposed. All of the elements in the proposed field of study lack systematic theoretical\r\ncharacterization, and the role of equilibrium isotopic fractionations in producing observed isotope\r\nabundance variations is not known. These elements are logical choices because of their relevance\r\nto geology and low-temperature geochemistry, because major uncertainties exist regarding the\r\nunderlying causes of observed fractionations, and because of the relative ease with which they\r\ncan be modeled. Studies will focus on materials that are subjects of current and likely future\r\nisotope measurements, including carbonates, silicates, and aqueous species.\r\nThe alkaline-earth elements all have relatively simple electronic structures and a single\r\ndominant oxidation state, making them ideal test cases for determining the effects of coordination\r\nnumber and hydration on isotopic fractionations. Because of their simple electronic structures,\r\nthese elements are amenable to many theoretical treatments, particularly ab initio modeling of\r\ncrystals using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). Ab initio computational chemistry\r\nand empirical force-fields will be used to estimate the vibrational frequencies of isotopically\r\nsubstituted crystals, molecules, and solvated clusters, providing the necessary input data for\r\nquantum-statistical calculations of equilibrium stable isotope fractionation factors. Materials with\r\nwell known vibrational spectra, like MgO and CaO, will also be modeled to check whether the\r\ncalculated vibrational properties are reasonable and accurate. Vibrational models generated in this\r\nproject will also become the nucleus of an animated mineral vibration database for use in\r\nmineralogy instruction. A successful research program devoted to these elements will provide a\r\nbasic geochemical framework for designing and interpreting stable isotope measurements in a\r\nwide variety of natural samples.\r\nNSF Merit Review Criteria:\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed research will be of broad interest in studies of the\r\npaleoclimate records preserved in mineral precipitates, in searching for robust biosignatures in\r\nminerals and biological molecules, in tracing alteration processes in the seafloor and their\r\ncontributions to global geochemical cycles in the mantle and subduction zones, and in meteoritic\r\nstudies of the origin of the solar system. The proposed research is also relevant to basic studies in\r\nstable-isotope geochemistry, because so little is known about the natural isotopic fractionations of\r\nelements heavier than sulfur, and in particular for very heavy elements like barium and strontium.\r\nThe project will also adapt ab initio techniques from computational chemistry and materials\r\nscience that will be broadly applicable to theoretical studies of the stable isotope geochemistry of\r\nother main-group elements like silicon, sulfur and lithium. The PI is highly qualified to perform\r\nthe proposed research, having previously modeled stable isotope fractionations of iron, chlorine,\r\nand chromium in molecules, crystals and aqueous complexes.\r\nBroader Impacts: This project will advance graduate education by supporting thesis\r\nresearch. Undergraduate education will also be enhanced through hands-on summer research\r\nopportunities. The proposed work involves the adaptation of modeling techniques from\r\ncomputational chemistry and materials science, and will partially support a computer modeling\r\nlaboratory, improving the infrastructure for research and interdisciplinary cross-fertilization. The\r\nonline database of mineral vibrations is intended to advance mineralogical research and\r\neducation, particularly in the areas of infrared and Raman spectroscopy, thermodynamics and\r\nheat transfer, and displacive phase transformations.",
