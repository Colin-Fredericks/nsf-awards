 "awd_abstract_narration": "Farquhar\r\nEAR-0348382\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes to use multiple sulfur isotopes to study the evolution of Earth's sulfur cycle.  The research includes investigation of mass-dependent sulfur isotope fractionations in the Proterozoic geologic record, investigation of mass-independent sulfur isotope fractionations of sulfide inclusions in diamond, and investigation of mass-independent sulfur isotope fractionations in Archean and Proterozoic carbonates.  The first investigation will work to identify whether there is multiple isotope evidence for proposed evolutionary events in the Proterozoic that effected changes in the sulfur cycle.  The second investigation will focus on providing constraints on material transfer of sulfur between Earth's early mantle and crust, and the third investigation will seek to understand the nature, size, and evolution of Earths early oceanic sulfate reservoirs.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal also integrates research and education by formalizing an ongoing program in which the PI works with graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who mentor undergraduate students.  It also contributes to the development of a new pair of courses focused on Revolutions of the Earth System that will be directed toward freshman and sophomore level undergraduates in the University of Maryland general core and, in alternate years, for the University of Maryland Honors program that will be an essential part of a new interdisciplinary Earth System Science curriculum.\r\n\r\n",
