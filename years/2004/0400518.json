 "awd_abstract_narration": "Larval transport and recruitment are widely regarded as important processes determining the distribution and persistence of adult populations in the world's oceans. Due to their microscopic size and incredible potential for dispersal, however, the larvae of most benthic marine species have never been tracked for more than a few days or over distances greater than a few hundred meters. In this Small Grant for Exploratory Research project investigators plan to test the feasibility of marking and recapturing larvae of the bay scallop (Argopecten irradians) with a fluorescent dye incorporated into the larval shell, which is retained by metamorphosed juveniles. The success of this project primarily depends on whether or not marked microscopic larvae can be produced in large enough numbers to be recovered in the field. Effects of the tag will be evaluated in the lab, followed by large scale culturing of marked larvae and an experimental release of larvae in Bogue Sound, NC. Previous work involving physical transport models, patterns of recruitment, and population genetic data from bay scallops together suggest that larvae are retained within this semi enclosed water body and not typically transported to adjacent basins.",
