 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to analyze and develop algorithms for large scale \r\nconvex programming problems. The principal investigator will extend the scope \r\nof interior point methods by developing invariant, primal and dual interior point \r\nmethods over homogeneous cones, which form a large class of problems including \r\nlinear programming, semidefinite programming, and second order cone programming.  \r\nHomogeneous cones have rich symmetry properties and a classification theory, which \r\nmake them an ideal candidate for extending the theory of structured interior point \r\nmethods beyond semidefinite programming.  The investigation of the modeling power \r\nof homogeneous cone programming will be an important part of the project, and \r\nseveral related topics in semidefinite programming and hyperbolic cone programming \r\nwill also be investigated. A second, but related component of this project will be \r\nthe development of provably efficient first order methods for large scale convex \r\nprogramming.  These methods have low memory requirements and global convergence rates \r\nwhich are (nearly) independent of the dimension of the underlying optimization problem. \r\nHence, they are attractive for solving very large scale problems for which interior \r\npoint methods may be ineffective because of their extensive memory requirements.  \r\nThe principal investigator and his graduate students will seek answers to these and \r\nrelated problems in convex programming.  The resulting algorithms will be numerically \r\ntested in order to confirm their effectiveness.\r\n\r\nNumerous problems from industry, engineering, and science (designs of VLSI, antenna \r\narrays, truss structures, and control systems in engineering, portfolio analysis in \r\nfinance, structure of molecules in quantum chemistry, combinatorial optimization, \r\nand many others) depend on efficient optimization algorithms for their resolution.  \r\nSemidefinite programming (SDP) has proved to be an excellent framework in which to \r\nmodel most of these large scale problems, and interior point methods for SDP have \r\nbeen very successful in solving them numerically.  Very large scale problems arising \r\nfrom medical imaging and quantum chemistry provide good incentives for developing \r\nfirst order methods for convex programming.  The theoretical insights gained from \r\nthis research will lead to a deeper understanding of interior point methods for \r\nsemidefinite programming and beyond.  These insights will enable the principal \r\ninvestigator, his students, and other researchers to develop faster, more reliable \r\nalgorithms which will make it possible to model and solve larger problems.  These \r\nadvances will directly benefit researchers in diverse scientific fields, who rely \r\non modern optimization techniques to solve their problems, by providing them with a \r\nset of state of the art algorithms. The research of this project will help advance \r\nthe frontiers of scientific research in convex programming, and will be incorporated \r\ninto undergraduate and graduate teaching whenever possible.",
