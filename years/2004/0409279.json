Examples include the migration of oil or gas into\r\nbrine-saturated rock or remediation of contaminated aquifers by injection of air. The\r\ndistribution of the invading fluid can include intricate fingering due to the inherent\r\nrandomness of the pore structure and its influence on capillary forces. A successful\r\nmethod to simulate the invading air is through a pore-scale, modified invasion\r\npercolation model in which the rock's void space is represented by a statistical\r\ndistribution of pore and throat sizes. Each pore is connected to several throats. The\r\nthroat on the air-water interface that is invaded is the one at which the driving potential\r\nsumming gravity, capillary, and viscous forces is greatest. The scientific goal of this\r\nproject is to connect the distribution of the fluid phases obtained from the percolation\r\nmodel to predict the elastic and electrical properties of the bulk rock formation. The\r\ninnovation proposed is to use a process-based quantification of fluid saturation at the pore\r\nscale as the basis for predicting physical properties that are extremely sensitive to the\r\nfluid distribution. These predictions are important for inferring the fluid saturations from\r\ngeophysical measurements. The working hypothesis is that the size distribution of the\r\ndefending water clusters is critical to the bulk elastic behavior. Small, isolated water\r\nclusters behave in an elastically soft manner because the water is able to flow into nearby\r\nair-filled voids. New laboratory measurements of elastic wave velocities during\r\nevaporative drying are proposed. They and recent electrical resistivity measurements\r\nduring evaporative drying conducted at Louisiana State University will be used to\r\ncalibrate and test the modeling process.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThis research is expected have applications in exploring hydrocarbon reservoirs and in\r\nmonitoring remediation of contaminated aquifers. This research will provide key rock\r\nlaboratory measurements and modeling tools to simulate the displacement of water by air\r\nor gas and then predict the changes in geophysical properties. New data collected on\r\nchanges of elastic wave velocities during evaporative drying will be useful to other\r\nresearchers testing their models. The research results will be disseminated through\r\npublications and oral presentations. The computer codes that will be developed as part of\r\nthe research will be useful to researchers in industry and will be made available on the\r\ninternet.",
