Among all compact\r\nnon-positively curved manifolds of rank one, the principal\r\ninvestigator plans to continue his study of the higher\r\ndimensional generalized graph-manifolds. He would like to\r\ninvestigate relations among Gromov's minimal volume gap\r\nconjecture, F-structure theory and semi-rigidity for\r\nnon-positively curved manifolds. Using the F-structure theory\r\ndeveloped by Cheeger and Gromov, the hopes to show that if a\r\nmanifold M admits a metric of non-positive sectional curvature,\r\nthen either M has non-vanishing minimal volume or M is a\r\ngeneralized graph-manifold with zero minimal volume.\r\nFurthermore, the principal investigator intends to verify that,\r\nif M is a compact non-positively curved manifold, which admits an\r\nF-structure, then M indeed is a generalized\r\ngraph-manifold. Together with Cheeger and Rong, the principal\r\ninvestigator recently discovered that, if a compact manifold M of\r\nnon-positive sectional curvature is homotopy equivalent to a\r\ncompact manifold with an F-structure, then M must have a local\r\nmetric splitting structure with nontrivial local tori\r\nfactors. The principal investigator would like to continue his\r\njoint research project with Cheeger and Rong in this\r\ndirection. In cooperation with Dr. Croke, the principal\r\ninvestigator also plans to continue his study of rigidity of the\r\ngeodesic flow and marked length-spectrum for manifolds of\r\nnon-positive sectional curvature. He would like to show that, if\r\na pair of compact generalized graph-manifolds of non-positive\r\nsectional curvature have the same marked length-spectrum, then\r\nthey must be isometric. In addition, the PI would like to\r\ncontinue his study of positive harmonic functions on manifolds of\r\nrank one and Martin boundary. His research on the sign of the\r\nEuler number of any compact Kaehler a-spherical manifold will\r\nalso be continued.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the study of global geometric shape of\r\nnon-positively curved spaces. The examples of non-positively\r\ncurved spaces include flat tires and surfaces with more than two\r\nholes, such as pretzels.  There are also examples of higher\r\ndimensional non-positively curved spaces. Our universe can be\r\nviewed a 3-dimensional space of zero curvature. Dr. Cao is trying\r\nto investigate diameter, volume, spectrum and other geometric\r\ndata of those spaces. Cao has also been interested in the study\r\nof the shortest closed curves on non-positively curved spaces. He\r\nhas already shown that two such surfaces with possible cusps are\r\nisometric if and only if the data of lengths of all shortest\r\nclosed curves on the two surfaces are identical. The data of\r\nlengths of all shortest closed curves on a closed surface M is\r\ncalled the marked length spectrum of the space M. The study of\r\nmarked length spectrum on spaces with boundaries has a number of\r\napplications in modern industry and geological sciences. The\r\nproposed problems involve various aspects of Riemannian geometry\r\nand Kaehler geometry. The techniques developed in the proposed\r\nresearch will have close connections with other fields in\r\nmathematics, including topology, partial differential equations,\r\nseveral complex variables and dynamical systems. The solutions to\r\nthe proposed problems will advance all these intricately related\r\nfields and open up a vast unexplored area. The proposed study of\r\nthe marked length-spectrum and the geodesic flow has close\r\nconnections with other branches of sciences including\r\ngeosciences.\r\n",
