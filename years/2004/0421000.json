 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal seeks support to acquire the SkyScan 1072 compact, desk-top X-Ray microtomograph system for the non-destructive, high spatial resolution (1.8mm/pixel), three-dimensional reconstruction of objects. Research applications include particle characterization (sand, toner, etc.) and imaging of stress-corrosion cracks in gas pipelines.\r\n\r\nThe proposed acquisition enhances the existing imaging capabilities in the nondestructive evaluation laboratory (NDE Lab) at Rowan University. Presently, we are able to image test objects using the following sensor modalities - magnetic, ultrasonic, thermal, acoustic, optical and 2-D X-Ray. We are developing digital image processing and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for predicting 3-D object profiles. These profiles are then visualized using the Virtual Reality (VR) system. However, currently, we do not have the capability to validate the accuracy of the sensor methods and the AI algorithms in predicting these 3-D profiles. The proposed X-Ray computed tomography (CT) system will provide us with exactly that capability; and serve as a validation \"gold\" standard.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit of the proposed activity\r\nThe acquisition and use of a CT system that provides 3-D reconstruction of object shapes as a validation \"gold\" standard significantly benefits the design of artificial neural network algorithms that are employed to predict 3-D shapes from conventional and emergent 2-D imaging techniques. This procedure allows us to develop novel NDE imaging methods that can explicitly demonstrate the various trade-offs that are involved in accurate 3-D characterization of object shapes.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the proposed activity\r\nThe NDE Lab in the Rowan University College of Engineering is a multi-disciplinary, collaborative research and teaching laboratory that supports the R&D efforts faculty, students (both graduate and undergraduate) and industrial partners. The proposed acquisition will positively impact research activities among other faculty not only in the College of Engineering, but also across Campus. Collaborations that are underway include the development of smart-sensors and bio-sensors -the reliability of these devices\r\nwill be tested using the proposed CT scanner.\r\n\r\nPreviously funded research projects in the NDE Lab have demonstrated significant educational impact. To date, the Lab has employed 32 undergraduate research assistants and 10 graduate research assistants. The Lab has supported an average of three multidisciplinary Engineering Clinic projects every semester since Fall 1999, impacting approximately 120 students. So far, 9 Faculty from three engineering disciplines (ECE, ME, CEE) have collaborated on research and education projects. We anticipate that 10 undergraduate students and 2 graduate students will use the proposed instrument every semester.\r\n\r\n",
