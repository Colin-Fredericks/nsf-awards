 "awd_abstract_narration": "BSCS proposes to conduct a design study on capstone biology at the high school level.  In U.S. high schools biology has traditionally been the science course that students take first, followed by chemistry and physics. Some schools recently have been implementing physics first and biology as the final (or capstone) course. This design study brings together experts in science, teaching, science education, professional development and curriculum development to study how biology as a capstone course must differ from an introductory course.  To provide informed results BSCS will use multiple techniques for acquiring reliable and relevant information.  These techniques include national surveys of teachers, administrators and biologists; case studies of capstone course implementation; a comprehensive review of the literature and commissioned essays.  After collecting this data BSCS will develop a coherent framework, present prospective models and make evidenced-based recommendations for a capstone biology course.  The findings of the study will be compiled in a monograph and an executive summary, which will be disseminated widely.",
