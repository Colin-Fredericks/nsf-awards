 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to study the process-structure-property relationship in the solidification of Mg-Zn-Y alloy droplets, with the ultimate goal of developing a safety-proven enabling technology for the processing of high-performance magnesium alloy particulate and bulk materials. The approach is to use controlled capillary jet breakup to enable processing with mono-size molten Mg-Zn-Y droplets large enough (>50 mm) to avoid pyrophoric explosions intrinsic to conventional droplet-based magnesium processing, yet small enough (<500 mm) to produce useful rapid solidification effects. This approach is novel in that it offers the only safe and effective means to produce rapid-solidification Mg-Zn-Y microstructures that exploit the stable quasicrystalline Mg42Zn50-Y8 phase for strengthening at the maximum level. An ability to control the droplet solidification microstructure is essential, which, in the present approach, is achieved by developing a numerical microstructure-predictive control model.\r\n\r\nThis research bears societal importance as it provides a unique approach to light materials processing which is critically desired in core manufacturing industries such as automotive, aerospace and electronics industries, particularly for the production of moving parts that require high specific-strength at room and elevated temperatures and parts for portable audio-video-communications-computer equipment. The knowledge acquired through this research, disseminated through presentations and publications, also apply to various other non-ferrous and ferrous alloys, functionally graded materials, metal matrix composites and near-net shape intermediate products. Student education is enhanced through providing graduate research assistantships, involving undergraduate students of underrepresented groups in hands-on projects, and organizing seminars and workshops on droplet-based and thermal materials processing.  \r\n",
