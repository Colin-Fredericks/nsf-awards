This project will examine current practices and perceived future developments in Chesapeake research, data gathering, and data use in the context of state-of-the-art cyberinfrastructure capabilities in order to plan the conceptual design of an EAN. An EAN is comprised of people and facilities linked through an infrastructure of collaboration tools, sensor networks, data repositories, computational tools (principally process models), and tools for data visualization and interpretation. The conceptual design will be the result of a multidisciplinary and multi-university under the direction of four PIs and two co-PIs from the Johns Hopkins University (JHU), the University of Delaware (U. DE), the University of Maryland (U. MD), and the Chesapeake Research Consortium (CRC) Chesapeake Community Model Program (CCMP) in collaboration with selected technical experts from the user and developer communities.",
