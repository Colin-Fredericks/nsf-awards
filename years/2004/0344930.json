 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor J. Eli Barkai of the University of Notre Dame is supported by the Theoretical and Computational Chemistry program through a CAREER award to develop theoretical methods for the treatment of single molecule spectroscopy, a powerful modern technique used to investigate a wide range of physical, chemical and biophysical phenomena.  Several applications are being considered:  the theory of single photons on demand; anti-bunching behavior for molecular systems in condensed phase environments; non-ergodic blinking of quantum dots; tracking of single molecules in solution; and single macromolecular fluorescence.  Barkai is using the quantum jump approach, also called the quantum Monte Carlo approach, to model these systems.\r\n\r\nAs part of this CAREER award, Professor Barkai is developing several courses in theoretical and computational chemistry, one of which is an interdisciplinary course aimed at students from departments beyond Chemistry.  In addition, the research will have a broad impact on fields beyond chemistry, especially those of biology and medicine in which single molecule spectroscopy is expected to play a role.",
