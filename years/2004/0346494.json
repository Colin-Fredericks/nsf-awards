It is the principal investigator's aim to develop smart aptamer (oligonucleotides of modest size) based polymeric nanogel platforms that would sense external perturbations, and respond appropriately. The investigator will incorporate DNAzymes (self cleaving aptamers) into nanogels so that they will release a pre-loaded antidote or produce a detectable signal upon binding of a toxin. The interfacial and colloidal properties of the synthesized nanogels will be studied using fluorescence spectroscopy, light scattering studies and ultra centrifugation while their delivery processes at the interface between nanogel and ligands will be studied using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy in real time. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  This nano-scale research project has been envisioned and conceived as a strongly interactive and collaborative program between the participating PI's in different disciplines---chemical engineering, biology and chemistry. It has potential applications in as diverse areas as microelectric circuits, sensors, nano-computers, cosmetics and bio-mimetic devices. Undergraduate students from a diverse body will have an opportunity to participate in this on-the-horizon technology through Columbia's current educational programs and focused outreach activities.\r\n\r\n",
