 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop an experimental-theoretical multi-scale approach whose key aspect is the optimized integration of the ambient temperature assembly by electrophoretic deposition and the high temperature consolidation by sintering such that functionally structured powder materials are produced by a synergistic net-shape-enabling technological sequence. The proposed approach assumes tailoring of the material structure at both macro and meso-scale levels by electrophoretic deposition which allows the production of net-shape particulate materials with required functionally graded structures, rendering the wanted final shape and the desired meso-structure after consecutive sintering.\r\n\r\nThe developed methodology should provide a basis for the fabrication of a wide range of functionally structured powder component systems such as bio-implants, electronic circuits, MEMS components, sensors, etc. with enhanced properties. The collaborative component of the program includes interactions with Sandia National Laboratories, the international collaboration with National School of Engineering, France, and collaboration with local industries that have been actively involved in the modeling and deformation processing of powder material components. The program will contribute to the advancement of the Materials and Manufacturing Sciences. \r\n",
