 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this project is to study how temporal changes in the isotopic \r\ncomposition of mammals are recorded in developing tooth enamel. Teeth form \r\nprogressively from crown to root and act as recorders of seasonal isotopic variation in the \r\nanimal blood bicarbonate reservoir.  This variation is in turn related to seasonal variations \r\nin climate, food availability, migration, ecosystem interactions, and other environmental \r\nconditions.  Isotopic signals are preserved in fossil tooth enamel, so teeth are important \r\narchives of ancient seasonality and environmental variation on short time scales.   \r\nDespite the wide usage of intra-tooth isotope approaches, there is considerable \r\nuncertainty as to how the measured signals relate to actual signals of variation within the \r\nanimal reservoir.  This uncertainty stems from inadequate knowledge of the temporal and \r\nspatial patterns of enamel mineral deposition and accumulation in teeth that are \r\ncommonly studied.  Although promising, the intra-tooth isotope method will remain \r\ncompromised as a paleoindicator until these uncertainties are addressed. \r\nWe will use micro-computed tomography (microCT) to investigate the temporal \r\nand spatial pattern of enamel mineral accumulation in developing teeth of animals of \r\nvarious ages from a range of species.  Maturation parameters determined from the \r\nmicroCT data will enable development of tooth- and species-specific models that \r\ndescribe how primary input signals are recorded as intra-tooth isotopic profiles.  Inverse \r\nmodels will be developed that allow estimates of primary input signals based on \r\nmeasured isotope data and knowledge of maturation parameters.  Comparison between \r\nmodel results and known isotopic changes in the animals studied will allow direct \r\nevaluation of the accuracy of these models. \r\nSpecifically, this study will provide maturation parameters for dentitions of \r\nAlpaca (alpaca), Capra (goat), and Bos (cow).  These animals underwent strictly \r\ncontrolled isotopic changes during tooth formation, and therefore this study will show the \r\nextent to which forward and inverse models based on maturation parameters allow for \r\nreconstruction of primary input signals.  These species span a range of diversity within \r\nthe artiodactyla and will show whether general models can be applied to many species \r\nwithin this order. \r\nIntellectual merit. This study will significantly increase the understanding of a \r\nbasic tool used by a wide variety of researchers.  The microCT, forward modeling, and \r\ninversion modeling methods will be of immediate use to researchers using the intra-tooth \r\nisotope method.  Forward and inverse modeling learned by other researchers as a result of \r\nthis study will broaden scientific background and benefit future studies.  Advances in the \r\nintra-tooth method owing to this study will help advance our understanding of ancient \r\nhuman environments and cultures, behavior and ecosystem context of extinct species, and \r\nancient climates and environments. \r\n  Broader impact.  This research will form the Ph.D dissertation of Benjamin \r\nPassey.  He will be responsible for the design, execution, and dissemination of this \r\nresearch and will learn valuable skills in project management, laboratory practice, data \r\nevaluation, and professional communication.  An undergraduate student will be involved \r\nin laboratory aspects of this project.  This person will gain invaluable first-hand research \r\nexperience and have opportunities to attend professional meetings to present results\r\n",
