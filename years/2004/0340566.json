This three-year award for U.S.-France cooperative research addresses the characterization of magnetic materials using ultra fast demagnetization methods.   The U.S. team led by Charles A. Schmuttenmaer of Yale University has expertise in the generation and detection of Terahertz (THz) radiation and spectroscopy.  The French group, headed by Eric Beaurepaire and Jean-Yves Bigot at the Universite de Strasbourg is expert at fabricating, analyzing, and understanding magnetism in ferroelectric thin films.  Together they will characterize the dynamics of demagnetization when a ferroelectric thin film is heated with an ultra fast laser pulse.  The project involves the use of THz spectroscopy. U.S. graduate students will benefit from training in THz radiation and spectroscopy and in techniques developed by the French group for designing and characterizing new ferromagnetic materials.\r\n\r\nThe project is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS).  NSF will provide support for visits by the U.S. investigator and graduate students.  The CNRS covers expenses for visits to the United States by the French investigators.  \r\n\r\n",
