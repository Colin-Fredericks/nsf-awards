 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe proposal seeks to bring together for a 3 day conference scholars from 3\r\nacademic communities: 1) the learning sciences; 2) science studies; 3) educational\r\nresearch. The structure of the conference has two parts. The sessions on the first day of\r\nthe conference will be devoted to discussion of issues about the nature of scientific\r\ninquiry and inquiry models of learning. The sessions on the second day will continue the\r\nfocus on inquiry models but also begin to ask questions and raise issues about aligning\r\nmodels of scientific inquiry into curriculum, instruction and assessment models.\r\nThere will be  representation from each of the 3 scholarly communities: learning sciences, science studies, and educational research. There will be two summary panel groups composed of educational researchers. The entire proceedings of the conference (e.g., presentations, comments, and discussions) will be published as an\r\nedited volume and made available as a CD. Symposium session presentations on the\r\noutcome of the conference will be submitted to American Educational Research\r\nAssociation, National Association for Research in Science Teaching, and the History of\r\nScience Society. In addition, the recommendations and issues emerging from this\r\nconference will inform the framework and content for the Critical Issues Conference of\r\nthe 2005 International History and Philosophy of Science and Science Teaching, Leeds,\r\nEngland.",
