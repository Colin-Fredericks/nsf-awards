 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nContacts between the earthquake engineering communities in the United States and Turkey\r\nhave intensified since the 1999 Kocaeli and Duzce earthquakes that led to damage and\r\nfailure of numerous structures in Turkey. Many bridges were affect by these earthquakes.\r\nThe US engineers and researchers have been working with their Turkish counterparts to\r\nmaximize the lessons learned from these earthquakes because these lessons would benefit\r\nboth countries. A joint US-Turkey workshop is proposed with the following objectives: (1)\r\nTo provide a forum to enhance communication between engineers and scientists involved in\r\nearthquake engineering of bridges in the United States and Turkey, (2) To exchange\r\ninformation about recent lessons learned in each country in seismic retrofit of bridges\r\nand health monitoring techniques to aid in post-earthquake investigations, (3) To develop\r\nareas of common needs and interest in bridge seismic retrofit and health monitoring, (4)\r\nTo develop a list of priorities for future joint US-Turkey research in seismic retrofit\r\nand post-disaster evaluation methods for bridges, and (5) To identify sources of funding\r\nfor joint research in both countries. Relative to previous US-Turkey workshops, the\r\nproposed program will have the new dimension of post-disaster evaluation of bridges.\r\nApproximately 18 to 20 US delegates will be selected for participation, some with full and\r\nothers with partial support from this project. The delegates will be from federal and\r\nstate transportation agencies, NSF, the private sector, and the academia. A steering\r\ncommittee will be formed to help select the members and develop the workshop program. The\r\nworkshop is tentatively scheduled for August 2004 in Ankara.\r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop will provide an opportunity for close exchange of ideas and lessons\r\nthat have been learned in the US and Turkey in seismic retrofit and post-earthquake\r\nevaluation of bridges. Both countries will benefit from the workshop as information is\r\ndiscussed in detail in the course of the four-day workshop. Seismic retrofit and\r\npost-disaster evaluation of bridges are still emerging. Both areas encompass a great deal\r\nof technical and non-technical issues. Learning the perspectives of engineers and\r\nresearchers from other earthquake-prone countries that face problems similar to those of\r\nthe US will enrich the knowledge of the scientific and design community in the US.\r\nFurthermore, the new potential collaborative research could involve undergraduate and\r\ngraduate students in the US. These students will be trained in earthquake engineering\r\nresearch and design and will be exposed to international views and perspectives. The\r\ntraining of skilled individual with understanding of international issues will enhance the\r\nmanpower in the US scientific work force and will improve the labor pool for more advanced\r\ndesign and research work in the global market.",
