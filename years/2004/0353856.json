 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Education Program continues a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Pittsburgh (UP).  Joseph Grabowski is the site's Program Director. During the award period (2004-2006), ten students will participate in a ten-week program each summer. These students will join the research groups of Pittsburgh Chemistry faculty and pursue an independent research project.  Students will be recruited nationally and special linkages are being developed with several HBCUs. Tutorials designed to educate these young scientists about important issues facing the research community will be held throughout the summer. All REU participants will also contribute to a cross-disciplinary Ethics Forum, a city-wide Research Poster Session and a  Chemistry Symposium in which each participant will give a 15-minute talk. Project evaluation will include an exit interview, a detailed end-of-the-program participant survey, and tracking as these students continue their professional development.\r\n\r\nThe Office of Multidisciplinary Activities is supporting a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) component of this site. A science teacher from the Pittsburgh Public School District will participate in all of the activities, including research with a University of Pittsburgh mentor.",
