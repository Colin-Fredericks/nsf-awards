 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering - Electrical (55)\r\n\r\nThe project is developing a signal-processing laboratory that is vertically integrated into the curriculum to illustrate theoretical concepts through application-driven exercises.  The proposed laboratory experience is modeled after the successful signal-processing laboratory at Rice University, but introduces two unique features. First, the new laboratory is integrated into multiple courses from the sophomore to senior level, rather than serving a single course. Second, the laboratory exercises are application-driven and emphasize the development of signal processing algorithms to be implemented on hardware. As students advance through the signal-processing curriculum, they transition from high-level algorithm generation to hardware-level design and implementation.   Using assessment tools developed jointly with the institution's Office of Assessment, the project is being evaluated on four criteria: conceptual learning, retention and enrollment, student motivation, and quality of materials. The investigators plan to publish their work in engineering education journals and present it at regional and national conferences, through their own website, and through an independent site that hosts educational material (cnx.rice.edu).  They also plan to make their material available in a printed laboratory manual with an accompanying CD containing real-world data and signals for use in the various experiments.\r\n",
