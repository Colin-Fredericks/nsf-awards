The project objectives are to improve throughput of useful data, resulting in (1) a 10- to 100-fold increase in speed of \"imaging\" with negligible increase in noise levels and (2) the capability for locating discontinuities along linear or otherwise one-dimensional surface features. Through a 2-dimensional lateral feedback mechanism, the instrument will allow for tracking and tracing of surface sites of high reactivity, thereby eliminating the need for imaging other surface regions of considerably less importance.  The advantages of these developments are the ability to observe molecular level surface structures responsible for surface reactivity and to follow the dynamics of these features in real time.  The development of this Step Tracing Scanning Probe Microscope (ST-SPM) will involve design, construction and testing of the feedback electronics, custom microscope, and software interface. The initial application of the ST-SPM will be in the study of carbonate mineralization where surface dynamics will be directly observed using the improved instrument. The project outcomes will include development of new instrumentation for advancement of scientific research and enhanced scientific understanding. The ST-SPM, with its ability to recognize and follow particular surface features, may also have a large impact on crystal growth research, micro- and nanoscale device characterization, molecular electronics, and nanolithographic techniques, thereby enhancing scientific understanding across a range of interdisciplinary fields. Commercialization plans include partnering with a leading SPM manufacturer to evaluate this new technology and if feasible, make it readily accessible.\r\n\r\n",
