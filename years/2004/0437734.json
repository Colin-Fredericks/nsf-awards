 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to hold the very first International Workshop on \"Mining of Manufacturing Enterprise Data\" as part of the Conference on \"Mathematical Methods of Learning - Advances in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery\" scheduled for June 21-24, 2004 in Como, Italy. The Workshop intends to serve as a forum for data mining researchers and also enterprise system researchers to meet to discuss how they can work together to advance the research in mining of manufacturing enterprise data.  The funding supports eight U.S. researchers from six universities to take part in the Workshop. They will present topics including\r\no\tAn overview of manufacturing enterprise data mining\r\no\tMining of time series data in manufacturing enterprise systems\r\no\tSelection of invariant objects with a data mining approaches\r\no\tModeling and applications in data mining and knowledge discovery\r\no\tProcess partitions for process data mining\r\no\tMining of human performance data from automated systems\r\no\tLearning from production scheduling data\r\no\tDiscovery and reuse of knowledge for engineering design\r\n\r\nThis Workshop attempts to depict the unique characteristics of manufacturing enterprise data and the associated data mining goals, to set new research directions for developing domain-specific, customized data mining algorithms, and also to explore the use of grid computing in mining of enterprise data. The results of the Workshop will be recorded in an edited book. The Workshop is also expected to foster an environment for national and international collaborations on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
