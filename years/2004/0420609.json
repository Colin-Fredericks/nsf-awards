 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant partially supports the acquisition of a variable pressure scanning electron microscope (VPSEM) and an X-ray computed tomography scanner capable of imaging small samples at very high resolution (Micro-CT).  The instruments will be housed and maintained by the University of Georgia's Center for Advanced Ultrastructural Research.  The instrumentation will be used by at least 10 major investigators for diverse studies, including:  microbial mineralization, bone bioengineering, nanofabrication of biosensors, plant organ development, Arabidopsis mutant morphology, food-borne bacteria interactions, neuronal dysfunction, reconstituted food products, and emulsion ultrastructure. The instrumentation will significantly expand the Center's capabilities by providing access to imaging conditions and modalities not currently available to University of Georgia researchers.  These two instruments share a common research focus - namely, to provide a very broad array of scientists with the resources they will need to explore the microstructure of specimens in the hydrated state without suffering the artifacts commonly encountered with extensive specimen preparation. The instruments will be available to researchers from the University of Georgia as well as other regional institutions and will be incorporated into the student training program of the Center which includes formal courses in microscopy, cell biology, geology, and food sciences.",
