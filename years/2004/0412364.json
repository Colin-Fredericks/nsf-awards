Some \r\ngroups of species have evolved extraordinary anatomical variation while \r\nother groups contain many species that look and act similar. To begin to \r\nunderstand how and why the general phenomenon of unequal diversification \r\noccurs, this research will investigate how and why a specific lineage of \r\nSouth American fishes related to piranhas and tetras evolved an anatomical \r\ndiversity very much greater than that of the lineage of its closest \r\nrelatives. This case study is rare and valuable because it approximates a \r\nnaturally controlled experiment. Because the two groups of fishes contain \r\nequal numbers of species, share a recent common ancestor (and therefore \r\nbegan to evolve independently at the same time) and live together \r\nthroughout tropical South America, the differences in their diversities \r\ncannot be explained by differences in net speciation rate, age, or \r\nenvironmental effects.  The removal of these factors leaves at least two \r\npotential explanations of the observed differences in diversity. The \r\ndifferences may be due to random evolution, or an intrinsic feature of \r\nanatomy or ecology shared only by the more diverse group may promote the \r\nevolution of new morphologies.  This research program will investigate \r\nthese two alternatives by 1) using a detailed anatomical study to \r\nreconstruct the genealogical relationships, or \"trees-of-life\" for these \r\nfishes, 2) measuring the anatomical differences between these species from \r\nan extensive series of x-ray images and 3) performing a novel analysis that \r\ncombines the measurements of anatomical differences and trees-of-life with \r\ncomputer simulations of evolution. This analysis will test whether \r\ndiversities as different as those observed could have evolved randomly.  If \r\nthe analysis were to reject the hypothesis of random evolution, then it \r\nwould be likely that an intrinsic difference drove one group to diversify \r\ngreatly while the other did not.  If the second alternative is supported, \r\nthis project will identify the anatomical and ecological features most \r\nlikely to have catalyzed the evolution of novelties in the more diverse \r\ngroup. Future studies can then test whether the evolution of similar \r\nproperties in other groups of organisms generally promotes the genesis and \r\nmaintenance of biodiversity.\r\n\r\nIn a broad sense, this study will help reveal why biodiversity is not \r\ndistributed equally across the tree-of-life for all organisms. The methods \r\ndeveloped for use in this project are transferable to studies of a wide \r\nvariety of other organisms and will be made freely available via the \r\nInternet. This project will also promote international collaboration on the \r\nstudy of an important group of tropical fishes valued as food throughout \r\nSouth America, prized for their ornamental beauty worldwide and that serve \r\nimportant ecological roles as part of the most species-rich freshwater fish \r\nfauna in the world.  Current and potential collaborations include work on \r\nthe discovery and description of new species, the building of natural \r\nhistory collections in the United States and in South America, and \r\nconservation biology. Results from this work also fuel a continuing \r\ndialogue about biodiversity with students and museum visitors through a \r\nseries of exhibits and public presentations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
