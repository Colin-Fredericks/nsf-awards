 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this CAREER award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Leonard J. Mueller will conduct research, at the University of California, Riverside, on (1) the development and application of  a two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance method for establishing through-bond connectivity in disordered solid materials using scalar coupling-driven correlation and (2) the development of carbon-13 correlation spectroscopy at the natural abundance level.  The latter method is being incorporated into the standard operating system release of pulse programs by Bruker BioSpin.\r\nThe educational component of the CAREER plan is aimed primarily at recruitment and training  of undergraduate researchers,many from underrepresented groups, and matriculating these students into graduate programs in chemistry.\r\n\r\nThis research project will develop new tools for the study of organic solids, using magnetic resonance methods.  The project will involve undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers.  Some of the undergraduate researchers working in Prof. Mueller's laboratory include participants of the California Alliance for Minority Participation in Science (CAMP) program.  In addition, Prof. Mueller involves undergraduates from the nearby Claremont Colleges (PUI's) in his research.\r\n",
