 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 3rd EPSRC/NSF/UK/US Workshop will be held in Washington, D.C. April 15 -16, 2004.  The meeting will again be organized on the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC( to promote collaboration and co-operating in research activities between the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe primary object of this 3rd Workshop will be to promote more co-operation and interaction among the computational sciences from the United States and the United Kingdom in the area of High Performance Computing, focusing on materials and biological applications, especially those requiring access to the\r\nlarge national computing facilities.  Goals for the meeting are to articulate current and future needs (for the bio and materials areas) with respect to the following areas at a minimum:  current and future uses of existing HPC machines and data rchives; current and future needs for grid based applications and next generation HPC hardware and software needs.  The meeting will also discuss areas where the biological and materials sciences could profitable collaborate and how to facilitate the development of US-UK collaborative projects and will discuss impediments to such projects (funding, use of each others facilities, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe US organizers are Ralph Roskies of the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center and Michael Klein of the University of Pennsylvania.  The UK organizer will be Mark Sansom from Oxford.  Representatives of the NSF will also be invited, as will representatives form the UK funding agencies.",
