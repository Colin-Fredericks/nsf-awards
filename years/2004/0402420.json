 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nCHE-0402420\r\nNuzzo/Illinois\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Nuzzo and his colleagues at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are investigating the detailed mechanisms of self assembly and soft lithographic methods for nano-patterning of materials.  They are working to develop new methods for characterizing these nano-patterned materials, and are exploring the mechanisms of self-assembly and growth of the modified layers.  One aspect of the work concentrates on the dynamics of liquid crystalline materials.  Another aspect deals with decal transfer lithography, and a third with microfluidic depletion lithography.  This third area of study is applied primarily to protein patterning on surfaces.  Results of these investigations promise to enhance our fundamental understanding of these emerging technologies for the fabrication of electrooptic, molecular electronic devices, and sensors.\r\n\r\nThe detailed understanding of self-assembly and growth of organic thin films and monolayers is essential to the development of emerging technologies for the fabrication of organic electronic and electrooptical devices.   Using spectroscopic methods, these complex materials systems are being characterized and developed. Lithographic methods for the production of nanopatterned materials are being explored, with subsequent application in electronic materials processing. \r\n\r\n",
