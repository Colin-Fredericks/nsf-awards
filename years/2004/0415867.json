The goals are to identify key emerging technologies that have the potential to transform science education; examine critical issues in science education reform that could point to potential uses for emerging technologies; explore how these emerging technologies can be anticipated by educators and harnessed to improve practice in formal and informal science education; outline the characteristics of a research agenda for science education in the context of these emerging technologies; and disseminate insights from the retreat to the science education community.\r\n\r\nThe two-day conference will include 12 invited discussants and up to 20 experts (observers).  Pre-conference activities are guided by a steering committee.  Post-conference activities include a published report of the conference findings\r\n",
