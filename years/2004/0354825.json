 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:  \r\n\r\nThis collaborative GOALI project between groups at the University of New Hampshire and the Rohm and Haas Company aims at developing a new class of aqueous coatings based on the catalytic polymerization of olefins in emulsion.  Catalytic polymerization of olefins allows control over polymer architecture while maintaining fast polymerization rates.  Aqueous coatings and adhesives are currently made by free radical polymerization in emulsion, often leading to polymers with ill-defined or complex microstructures.  With the advent of new generations of late transition metal catalysts, the PIs envision the preparation of polyolefin latexes by catalytic emulsion copolymerization of ethylene and alpha- olefins, acrylates or styrene.  Here they plan to design such products by first looking at the catalyst selection, then by identifying the key components of the emulsion process, and finally by identifying the range of products that are going to be studied.  The resulting new materials will combine the advantages inherent to polyolefins (cost effectiveness, wide range of mechanical and thermal properties, well-defined structures, and chemical stability) with the unique applications offered by polymer colloids (coatings with zero volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and ease of manufacturing, handling and transporting).\r\n\r\nPreliminary results have already demonstrated the feasibility of the catalytic copolymerization of olefins in emulsion.  Upon the successful completion of this project, the commercial manufacture of a new family of polymer latexes could be enabled via a new platform of catalyst and emulsion polymerization technology.  The research program covers catalytic emulsion copolymerization of olefins, styrene and acrylics with a high degree of structural control.  The project links organometallic chemistry and catalysis with emulsion polymerization and materials science.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  \r\n\r\nThe successful completion of this project could constitute a breakthrough in polymer synthesis and permit the manufacture of a new class of environmentally safe materials with zero VOCs.  It could thus benefit society by reducing waste production and energy consumption, and by making better of use of petrochemical feedstocks.  Participation by industry will foster technology transfer.  The research will also promote hands-on industrial training for the students involved as they will spend time at the industrial facility.  The company will also sponsor one or more undergraduate students and familiarize them with industry and its concepts of sustainable development.\r\n",
