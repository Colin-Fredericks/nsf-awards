 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the development of new theory and models for tactical logistics \r\nplanning problems under uncertain demand. The core decision problem focus of this \r\nresearch lies in optimally matching downstream requirements with upstream \r\nresource capabilities in production and logistics systems. The modeling approach \r\nimplicitly accounts for an important structural feature of practical logistics systems, \r\nwhich requires identifying a unique upstream source facility (e.g., plant, warehouse) \r\nfor serving each downstream stage (e.g., warehouse, retailer). This pervasive \r\nstructure found in production and logistics systems both reduces downstream \r\nordering and delivery receiving complexity, and decreases the need for upstream \r\ncross-facility coordination. As a result of these medium-term decisions, short-term \r\noperations planning and execution problems decompose into separate subproblems \r\n(one for each upstream facility), which reduces system-wide operations planning \r\ncomplexity. This research takes an integrated view of optimizing logistics network \r\nperformance, where transportation decisions are considered jointly with other \r\nlogistics network decisions that drive overall performance, such as production and \r\ninventory storage decisions, while explicitly accounting for demand uncertainty.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide an integrated approach for solving tactical logistics planning \r\nproblems effectively, thus providing opportunities for streamlining distribution system \r\ncosts. In particular, new and effective algorithms will be developed that can solve \r\nmedium- to large-size problems to near-optimality with limited computational effort, \r\nand also enjoy a formal performance guarantee. The associated algorithms will be \r\ndeveloped in a general model setting, allowing for specialization to a broad range of \r\nspecific problem contexts. In addition, through collaboration with an optimization \r\nsoftware development firm, it will provide a solution methodology that will allow for \r\nthe reuse of much of the software developed for one problem in the solution of other \r\nproblems, thereby speeding up software development time. \r\n",
