 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several species that have been traditionally defined on the basis of morphology recently have been discovered to consist of two or more genetically distinct groups each.  These findings raise fundamental questions about how \"cryptic\" species coexist when an animal's morphology is used to define its ecological niche.  Theory predicts that no two species should occupy the same niche at the same time and place.  In this study Dr. Thomas Kunz and Susan Murray will investigate the separation that allows coexistence, by comparing morphology, feeding ecology, roosting habitats, and population genetic structure between morphologically cryptic bat species (bicolored leaf-nosed bats) in peninsular Malaysia.  The research will help us understand ecological and evolutionary processes that lead to similar morphologies of coexisting species, and why some animal assemblages are more species-rich than others.  Recognition of cryptic species may also affect estimates of biodiversity and how conservation priorities are determined.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research include new training opportunities for Murray, establishment of new collaborations with Malaysian, Indonesian, and British researchers, and providing research opportunities for Malaysian undergraduates. Educating and training indigenous and local peoples on the ecological importance of bats and how to protect delicate cave ecosystems will be an important part of this project.\r\n",
