The Center for Internet Epidemiology and Defenses aims to address twin fundamental needs: to better understand the behavior and limitations of Internet epidemics, and to develop systems that can automatically defend against new outbreaks in real-time.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the scope and emergent behavior of Internet-scale worms seen in the wild constitutes a new science termed \"Internet epidemiology\".  To gain visibility into pathogens propagating across the global Internet, the Center is pursuing the construction and operation of a distributed \"network telescope\" of unprecedented scale.  The telescope in turn feeds a \"honeyfarm\" collection of vulnerable \"honeypot\" servers whose infection serves to indicate the presence of an Internet-scale worm.\r\n\r\nTo then fight worms once detected, the Center works on developing mechanisms for deriving \"signatures\" of a worm's activity and disseminating these to worm suppression devices deployed throughout the global network.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Center strives to ground its research in the potentially thorny, but highly relevant, \"real-world\" issues of informing the development of legal frameworks in terms of the appropriate use of anti-worm technologies and their applications for providing forensic evidence; and enabling the development of actuarial models for quantifying exposure to aggregate risk and liability from Internet epidemics, critical for supporting the emerging cyber-insurance industry.\r\n\r\n",

Its activities spanned 2004-2012.\nCCIED pursued a multi-faceted approach to countering these large-scale threats: measuring and analyzing in detail numerous outbreaks over much of the past decade; assessing the behavior, limitations, and likely evolution of the malware used to launch the attacks; developing early-warning and forensic capabilities; devising novel defense technologies; and illuminating the broader criminal \"ecosystem\" that plays a crucial role in fueling today's large-scale attacks by rendering them both easy to launch and financially profitable to those who conduct them.\nA key enabler of CCIED's successes was the team's extensive work on developing new technologies for supporting the observation and analysis of large-scale Internet attacks.
