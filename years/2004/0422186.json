 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase II project concerns the development of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells with improved power density (kW/L) and specific power (kW/kg), reduced cost, and simplified assembly. A new type of electrically conductive polymer sheet has been developed that can be used as both, gas diffusion layer and bipolar plate in PEM fuel cells. The material is light, inexpensive, highly conductive, chemically inert, easy to process, and corrosion resistant. The use of this conductive polymer in PEM fuel cells will reduce cell weight, volume, and cost, while simplifying cell assembly. During the Phase II project, the conductive polymer materials will be optimized as bipolar plates and gas diffusion layers, and they will be integrated into PEM fuel cell stacks.\r\n\r\nThe new material has significant commercial potential because of its multifunctionality, lightweight, effectiveness, and low cost.  The potential customers are developers currently working with PEM fuel cells operating on hydrogen, methanol, and reformed hydrocarbon fuels. This includes all of the automotive manufacturers and the manufacturers of stationary fuel cell power systems.  \r\n",
