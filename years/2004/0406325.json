However, most existing security systems, which are not built for the light, thin devices of pervasive computing environments, cannot provide quality of protection to applications. The proposed research will explore a capsule-based security system to support flexible quality of protection in pervasive environments. The PI will develop a model of security as services that centers on people, instead on devices, for improving the usability of security. A testbed will be designed and implemented to evaluate and demonstrate the proposed security system. The proposed research will generate excellent topics for graduate and undergraduate education, covering security, robustness, and design of distributed applications and capsule-based systems. The involved students include under-represented minorities from HBCU at North Carolina.\r\n",
