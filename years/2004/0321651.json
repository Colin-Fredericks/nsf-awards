 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II proposes to develop a Meshless Petrov-Galerkin Geo-Environ Technology For Wide Scale Field Uses.  Groundwater supplies are increasingly threatened by organic, inorganic, and radioactive contaminants that are introduced to the environment by improper disposal or accidental releases.  Estimates of remediation costs at U.S. government sites alone totals into the billions of dollars.  Computational mechanics and aerospace advances in meshless Petrov-Galerkin provide easy means for stable accurate simulations of large groundwater reservoirs without grid generation. The proposed software package Meshless Groundwater Model-Petrov Galerkin (MGM-PG) will be designed for advanced hydrologists as well as for groundwater basin managers, purveyors, and field hydrologists. Current software advancements will be interfaced for easy conceptual model development for various applications.\r\n\r\nMGM-PG potential market includes: (i) groundwater reservoir quantity and quality management; (ii) cleanup of contaminated sites; (iii) storage of wet year surplus surface water underground and its uses for extended draught periods (ASR projects); (iv) safe disposal of treated effluents by rapid infiltration and extraction projects (RIX projects); (v) conjunctive uses of surface and subsurface water; (vi) landfill sites; and (vii) cleanup of large contaminated Federal Facilities. Proposed technology has applicability to thousands of EPA National Priority List for expedited clean up of contaminated sites and also for groundwater management projects that are implemented at a cost of billions of dollars by federal agencies, State, counties, petroleum facilities, and chemical industries. Worldwide only 4-5 geo-environ codes have been developed for wide variety of societal needs. MGM-PG will be a new technological advancement and will promote training of new graduate students in meshless advances rather than old methods.",
