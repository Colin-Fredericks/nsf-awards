 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for award DMS-0403686 of Baragar        \r\n\r\nA fundamental tenet of arithmetic geometry is the notion that one can infer\r\narithmetic properties of a variety from its geometry.  The investigator's\r\nresearch primarily deals with such a notion.  Specifically, the PI hopes to\r\nshow that the number of rational points with bounded Weil height in an orbit\r\nunder the action of the group of automorphisms of a K3 surface grows\r\nasymptotically like a power of the bound.  The exponent of growth should\r\ndepend only on the geometry of the surface.  When the K3 surface contains\r\nno -2 curves, the exponent is expected to be n-2, where n is the dimension\r\nof the Picard group.  The situation is particularly interesting when there\r\nare -2 curves. In this case, the exponent of growth should be related to the\r\nKahler cone or nef cone.  The Kahler cone lies in a Lorentz space of\r\ndimension n (where the intersection product is the Lorentz product) and a\r\ncross section of the cone lies in a hyperbolic space of dimension n-1.  When\r\nthe K3 surface has a -2 curve, the boundary at infinity of this cross\r\nsection is a fractal on a sphere of dimension n-2. The PI believes that the\r\npreviously mentioned exponent of growth should be the Hausdorff dimension of\r\nthis cross section.  When n=4, these fractals are similar to the well known\r\nApollonian gasket.\r\n\r\nThis is basic research aimed at improving our understanding of K3 surfaces\r\nand related objects.  Surfaces of type K3 can be thought of as higher\r\ndimensional analogs of elliptic curves, for which analogous research was the\r\nsubject of early 20th century mathematics. Our basic understanding of\r\nelliptic curves eventually led to the development of elliptic curve based public key codes, fast\r\nfactoring algorithms, and efficient error correcting codes.  The theory and\r\nexistence of public key codes revolutionized cryptography and with it, the\r\ninternet as we know it.  Without them, internet based commerce would be far\r\ntoo vulnerable to allow the sorts of transactions we currently take for granted.  A K3 surface can\r\nalso be thought of as a two dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold.  Three\r\ndimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds are of interest to physicists studying\r\nstring theory and quantum field theory.\r\n",
