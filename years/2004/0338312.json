 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the auspices of the University of Alabama (UA) Center for Advanced Vehicle Technologies, undergraduate and graduate fellows in engineering and mathematics will work in science and mathematics classrooms in middle and high schools in Tuscaloosa city and county.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in its responsiveness to three current, critical challenges for improving math and science education.  It is simultaneously increasing students' interest in STEM fields; demonstrating the wonder of discovery while improving students' mastery of math and science skills; and acknowledging the professionalism of teachers.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this program will be quite high in that through the participating schools, it will reach a significant number of underrepresented middle and high school minority students (approximately 75%).  In addition, a large number of the key project leaders are women, including the PI, and will thereby serve as role models to the participating fellows, students, and teachers.  This project will also build sustainable alliances between UA, middle and high schools, and the Alabama automotive industry.  \r\n\r\nThis project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Engineering. \r\n \r\nTitle: Track 1, GK-12:  Graduate Teaching Fellows in Middle and High School Education\r\nInstitution: University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa\r\nPI/Co-PI: Beth A. Todd, Kenneth C. Midkiff, Sharon E. Nichols, Jill Shearin and Zhijian Wu\r\nPartner School Districts: Tuscaloosa City and Tuscaloosa County School Systems\r\nNumber of Fellows per Year: Year 1: Six graduates and 3 undergraduate fellows\r\n\t\t\t\t   Year 2: Eight graduate and four undergraduate fellows\r\n                                                   Year 3: Ten graduate and five undergraduate fellows\r\nTarget Audience: Middle and high school students\r\nSetting: Suburban\r\nNSF Supported Disciplines: Engineering and mathematics\r\n",
