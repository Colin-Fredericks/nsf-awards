 "awd_abstract_narration": "DEFAULT BAYESIAN METHODS FOR NONPARAMETRIC PROBLEMS\r\n\r\n\r\nStatistical models for complex data often contain one or more\r\ninfinite-dimensional parameters such as a probability density, a\r\nregression function, or the transition density of a Markov\r\nprocess. The rapid development of innovative Monte-Carlo schemes\r\nin the last decade makes it possible to compute Bayes\r\nprocedures in these complex problems. However, because of the high\r\ndimensionality, it is seldom possible to completely elicit a prior\r\nsubjectively from the available information. What is needed is a\r\ngeneral strategy for constructing priors for infinite-dimensional\r\nparameters that incorporates available prior information, such as\r\nsmoothness (differentiability) or shape (monotonicity, convexity,\r\nunimodality) of a regression function or density function.\r\nIdeally, the constructed prior should be tested in the given\r\nproblem to avoid possible pitfalls in estimation. Large-sample\r\nproperties such as consistency and rate of convergence are\r\nwell-respected benchmark test criteria. In this research the\r\ninvestigator constructs prior distributions for select\r\nproblems using a default approach, devises suitable algorithms for\r\ncomputation of the posterior, develops software for computation,\r\ninvestigates the large sample behavior of the resulting procedures,\r\nsupports the theory and methods via simulation studies with\r\nmoderately large samples, and applies the new methods to several\r\ninteresting data sets. The research provides Bayesian\r\nmethodologists with a catalog of priors with known performance\r\nproperties, thereby facilitating the application of Bayes methods\r\nin other models with high-dimensional parameters.\r\n\r\n\r\nModern statistical models for data in a wide variety of\r\napplications, such as data mining, image analysis, biometrics,\r\nbiostatistics, bioinformatics, signal processing, and finance,\r\noften depend on high- or infinite-dimensional parameters such as \r\nsurvival distributions, probability densities, regression\r\nfunctions, transition densities of Markov chains, and so on. Successful\r\nanalysis of such data presents challenges not found in the\r\nanalysis of finite-parameter models, and requires the development\r\nof new statistical theory, methods and software. A non-subjective \r\nBayesian method retains the advantages of the Bayesian paradigm \r\nwithout requiring a subjective prior elicitation. In this\r\nresearch the investigator develops the theory, methods, and\r\ncomputational algorithms for implementing default Bayesian analyses of\r\ncomplex statistical models depending on infinite-dimensional\r\nparameters. The research is disseminated through the teaching\r\nof advanced courses and via the usual scientific channels of\r\npublications and seminars. The research provides new\r\ndata-analytic tools for solving problems arising in diverse \r\nfields. Useful priors with known performance are cataloged \r\nand user friendly software is developed for ready applications \r\nto diverse fields. Thus the research has a major impact on the \r\nconduct of science in a number of highly-relevant\r\napplication areas.",
