(2) For which sphere bundles does the total space admit a \r\nRiemannian metric with positive curvature?  The PI plans to use these tools \r\nto find new examples, obstructions, and rigidity theorems.  In particular, \r\nthe PI plans to construct metrics of nonnegative curvature on holomorphic \r\nvector bundles over complex projective space, and determine whether Einstein-\r\nHermitian connections can appear as the connections in the normal bundles of \r\ntheir souls.  Also, the PI intends to study nonnegatively curved metrics on \r\ntrivial vector bundles over spheres.  This problem is related to the Hopf \r\nconjecture, or more specifically to the question: how large is the family of \r\nnonnegatively curved metrics on the product of two spheres?  The PI will work \r\nwith undergraduate students studying the metrics on such products obtained by \r\nre-scaling the product metric by a compact Lie group which acts by \r\nisometries.  Finally, the PI proposes to find obstructions to metrics of \r\nnonnegative curvature on vector bundles over spheres with prescribed soul \r\nmetrics.\r\n\r\nThe question of which manifolds can have nonnegative curvature is central to \r\nRiemannian geometry.  Nonnegative curvature is a visually natural restriction \r\non the way in which an object curves about in space.  All known examples come \r\nfrom compact Lie groups with bi-invariant metrics, which are indispensable \r\ntools in diverse fields of mathematics, physics, cosmology, and other \r\ndisciplines in which simplification is achieved through symmetry.  The search \r\nfor new examples of manifolds with nonnegative (or positive) curvature has a \r\nlong history, yet very few constructions are known.  Since his tools \r\nrepresent a construction which is substantially different form known methods, \r\nthe PI believes they deserve further study.\r\n",
