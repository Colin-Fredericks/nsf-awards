 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds on the success of prior NSF support by supporting 60 students in STEM fields over a four-year period in their last two years of undergraduate study. The CSEMS Program enables students to enter the high technology workforce or pursue a graduate degree after completing a baccalaureate degree in computer science, mathematics, or engineering. The project expands opportunities and support for women, minorities, and persons with disabilities, and exposes students to interdisciplinary cooperation in STEM areas through regular dialogue and interaction between students, faculty and industry professionals.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in giving students a better knowledge and understanding within their own fields and across other STEM fields through a seminar that is team-taught by faculty and industry professionals. Student participation at professional meetings and conferences with faculty is also encouraged and supported.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project include participation of women, minorities, people with disabilities, and first generation college students. The project coordinates both NSF and other support for promising students and promotes faculty and peer mentoring. Student support activities--targeted recruitment of scholars, faculty and peer mentoring, and financial support--will enhance student learning, confidence, performance, retention to graduation, and career or graduate school placement.",
