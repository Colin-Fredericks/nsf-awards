Shaw\r\nDepartment of Aerospace Engineering\r\nThe University of Michigan\r\n1. Project Summary\r\nShape memory alloys (SMAs) are technologically important materials, because of two\r\nuseful features: the shape memory effect and the pseudoelastic effect. Their interesting thermomechanical\r\nresponse makes them attractive as low frequency robust actuators and passive devices\r\nfor a variety of novel applications. The thermo-mechanical behavior of SMAs is due to displacive,\r\nfirst-order phase transformations (or martensitic transformations), which produce complex, finescale\r\nmicrostructures. This feature is at the heart of modeling difficulties encountered in the\r\ncontinuum descriptions of these materials. Existing work on continuum modeling of SMAs is\r\nbased on finite thermoelasticity theory and requires the use of phenomenological strain energy\r\ndensity functions. Solutions of boundary value problems based on these functions are successful in\r\npredicting many features of the experimentally observed fine scale microstructures. This approach,\r\nhowever, leaves a host of other problems unanswered, such as the lattice-level origin of the\r\ninstabilities, the number of coexisting phases and the characteristic wavelengths of the observed\r\nmicrostructures.\r\nThe novel feature of the proposed investigation is the use of atomic lattice simulations of\r\nSMAs, and in particular for NiTi, the most technologically promising material in its class. Our goal\r\nis to generate realistic energy densities and to simulate and understand the stability phenomena at\r\nthe nanometer scale. Specifically, we intend to find all equilibrium phases for temperature and stress\r\nand their corresponding microstructures (twinning and crystal interfaces) and study their stability\r\nwith the ultimate objective to bridge the scales between the nano-(lattice) phenomena and micro-\r\n(single crystal) behavior. Besides advancing a fundamental understanding of SMAs at the nanoscale,\r\nthe work has the potential to help answer why certain intermetallic alloys exhibit shape\r\nmemory phenomena and other do not, and this work could eventually be used to guide the search\r\nfor new SMAs.\r\nThe research team consists of two investigators, Professors Nicolas Triantafyllidis and John\r\nShaw, who bring complementary expertise to the project. The requested funds will fund one\r\ndoctoral student over a period of three years plus a one year post-doctoral appointment for Mr.\r\nRyan Elliott, who is working with the PI's on this area. Collaboration with the Theoretical Physics\r\ngroup of Los Alamos National Labs is underway through hosting of the graduate students during\r\nthe summers. Results of this research will be used in a new graduate level, cross-disciplinary course\r\non atomistic modeling in solid mechanics.\r\nBroader Impact of the proposed work: This work fits well within the current nanomechanics\r\ninitiative at NSF, since it pertains to the study of underlying lattice stability phenomena\r\nof m-crystals from atomistic considerations. Understanding these phenomena will eventually be\r\nuseful in the conception of novel materials with shape memory effects. The proposed work not only\r\naddresses a fundamental problem in mechanics, but it also requires input from other disciplines, i.e.\r\ncondensed matter physics and applied mathematics. The existing collaboration with Los Alamos\r\nNational Labs provides a natural framework for the interaction with these disciplines and for the\r\ndissemination of the knowledge to be created.",
