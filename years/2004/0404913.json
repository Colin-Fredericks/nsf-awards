 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Workshop will be held in Kona, Hawaii from 23 rd to 26th February 2004 and will be co-sponsored by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and National Science Foundation (NSF).  The Organizing Committee for the Workshop consists of Drs. Tom Delworth (NOAA), Chet Koblinsky (NOAA), Eric Lindstrom (NASA Oceanography), Zhengyu Liu (University of Wisconsin), Jay McCreary (University of Hawaii), Jerry Meehl (National Center for Atmospheric Research), Vikram Mehta (PI), and Jim O'Brien (Florida State University).  The format will consist of oral presentations and discussion sessions.\r\n\r\nApplicants will be selected by the Organizing Committee based on their performance in the competition outlined as follows.  Applicants, either individually or in groups, will write a literature review on a topic of their choice from one of the themes from the workshop.  Ten authors of the best review papers will receive full travel and per-diem expenses to go to this Workshop; one of the authors of each paper will be required to orally present his/her review paper in the Workshop.  For winning papers with multiple authors, all authors will receive travel and per diem expenses to go to the Workshop. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe workshop provides an excellent opportunity for graduate students to interact with leaders in the field of low frequency climate variability and hence will add substantially to their normal university education and training experiences.",
