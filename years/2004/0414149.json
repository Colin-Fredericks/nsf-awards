 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed to organize a workshop on recent advances in algebraic systems and\r\ncontrol theory. The workshop will bring together researchers in mathematics,\r\nengineering, and computer science to discuss recent developments in algebraic systems\r\ntheory and its application to large-scale, hierarchical, complex dynamical systems.\r\nApplication domains include manufacturing, telecommunications, robotics, and bio-\r\nmedical systems. A principal objective of the proposal is to explore evolutionary trends\r\nfrom mature areas like classical systems theory and optimal control to emerging areas\r\nsuch as hybrid systems and networked control. Identifying such trends will serve to better\r\nunderstand the general direction of developments in the control discipline. The topical\r\nscope of the workshop is sufficiently broad so as to include the main areas in control\r\ntheory. The presentations will include synopses of historical trends as well as recent state-\r\nof-the-art results, and will focus on theory, practice, and education. The meeting will\r\ntake place on the campus of the Georgia Institute of Technology on January 23-24, 2004.",
