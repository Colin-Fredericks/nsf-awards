 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this dissertation research is to understand how generalized information systems emerge and persist when information, as the object of exchange, produces a collective good.  In this type of generalized exchange, individuals contribute to a collective good (pool of information), and the rewards that an actor receives come from this collective good.  Because it is rational to free ride by receiving rewards from the public pool of information while not contributing to it, understanding how generalized information exchange emerges and persists requires individuals to overcome a social dilemma.  I develop a theoretical argument that specifies how social psychological processes act as selective incentives that increase individual contributions to a public pool of information.  In particular, when the costs associated with contributing information are small, social psychological factors such as the popularity of one's own information and the normative obligation associated with observing cooperative behavior can have a relatively profound effect on cooperation.  The data for this research will be collected at the Stanford University Laboratory for Social Research in the Department of Sociology.  Approximately 150 experimental subjects will participate in one of five experimental conditions that use a computerized exchange program that was developed specifically for this research. The broader impacts of this research include the following:  In a world where the instantaneous transfer of information is crucial to world business, education, economics, and politics, understanding how information exchange systems can emerge and persist is a central problem for our increasingly interconnected societies.  The results of this study have broader implications for both generalized exchange theory and real world generalized information exchange systems.  This dissertation extends theory and findings on generalized exchange, collective action, and social dilemmas by focusing on information as the object of exchange and the role of social psychological selective incentives in generalized exchange systems. Additionally, this research can help us to understand the underlying processes that lead to the emergence of real-world generalized information exchanges such as those found in peer-to-peer networks on the Internet.  \r\n\r\n",
