 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIt is proposed to conduct research on the design of output feedback control of nonlinear systems.\r\nIn the past several years, the principal investigator's team has introduced and developed a new\r\napproach to this problem that combines high-gain observers with saturation nonlinearities. The\r\napproach proved useful in achieving fundamental progress in semiglobal stabilization, sliding-mode\r\ncontrol, servomechanisms, and adaptive control. The earlier work has emphasized robustness and\r\nasymptotic behavior, which quite often come at the expense of the transient performance. The\r\ngoal of this proposal is to develop new tools for nonlinear design that ensure acceptable transient\r\nperformance, while ensuring robustness and a desired asymptotic behavior. There are two main\r\nthrusts in the proposal. The first one it to develop the tool of conditional integrators and ser-\r\nvocompensators, which was recently introduced by the principal investigator's team, to a much\r\nwider class of nonlinear systems and design methods. The second one is to develop a logic-based\r\nswitching control strategy for a class of nonlinear systems, as an alternative to robust and adaptive\r\ncontrol, in order to improve performance in the face of large model uncertainties.\r\nThe class of nonlinear systems under consideration arises in many applications such as mechan-\r\nical systems, aircraft control, and electric motor drives. Earlier results have been applied to the\r\ncontrol of induction motors and a mechanical system known as the pendubot. It is planned to\r\ncontinue using these two systems as testbeds for the new techniques.\r\n",
