 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n  The  Molecular  Genetics  of  Bacteria  and  Phages  Conference, traditionally held at Cold \r\nSpring Harbor and now being held in alternate years at the University of Wisconsin in Madison \r\nand at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, is a central forum for the presentation of new results \r\nin  prokaryotic molecular  genetics.    On  the  order  of  200-400  participants  attend,  representing \r\nlaboratories  throughout  the  world,  and  most  present  either  short  talks  or  posters.    Its  breadth \r\nmakes  it  an  important  focus  for  the  exchange  of  information  in  this  era  of  scientific \r\nspecialization.    Topics  covered  include  fundamental  work  on  bacterial  replication, \r\nrecombination,  repair,  transposition,  transcription,  control  of  gene  expression,  translation, \r\nsignalling,  heat  shock,  protein  folding  and  secretion,  cell  development  and  division,  and \r\npathogenesis.   \r\n \r\n  For many  graduate  students  and  postdoctoral  fellows,  this  is  the  first  large meeting  at \r\nwhich  they  have  an  opportunity  to  speak.    Due  to  its  highly  interactive  nature,  the  meeting \r\nprovides  an  important  opportunity  for  these  young  scientists  to  meet  and  talk  to  the  senior \r\nscientists they know from the literature.  In response to the large numbers of students who attend \r\nthe  meeting  and  the  diversity  of  topics  covered,  established  and  distinguished  scientists  are \r\ninvited  to  chair  each  session.    This  strengthens  the  meeting  because  each  chairperson  gives  a \r\nshort  introduction  in  which  he  or  she  summarizes  some  of  the  key  facets  of  the  field  to  be \r\ncovered and provides a conceptual framework for the major questions that the talks will address.  \r\nAs  an  additional  benefit,  publicizing  the  judiciously  chosen  chairpeople  and  session  topics  in \r\nannouncements of the meeting, encourages the submission of abstracts in exciting new areas and \r\nstimulates attendance by a larger constituency\r\n",
