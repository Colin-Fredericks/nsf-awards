Our efforts\r\nfocus on identifying those characteristics of size and location that\r\ncan be computed from data sets that are much too small to uniquely\r\ndetermine the source or scatterer.\r\n\r\nThe Born approximation to time harmonic scattering is the Fourier\r\nTransform. In this approximation, one such data set would be the\r\nrestriction of the Fourier transform of a function to a sphere . In\r\nthis case, it is impossible to find the support of the function from\r\nthis data, but we can find a smallest convex set, a set which must\r\nbelong to the convex hull of the support of any function with this\r\nrestricted Fourier transform. This set can be stably calculated, even\r\nfrom noisy data.\r\n\r\nFor other data sets, there are other \"minimal supports\", where the\r\ndefinition of \"support\" depends on the data set. We seek to discover\r\nthe correct notion of support for different data sets and different\r\nmodels. In the presence of a priori information (e.g. polygonal shape\r\nor positivity), these minimal sets may even describe true supports. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe focus of this project is to develop and improve algorithms for\r\nacoustical and electro-magnetic remote sensing (e.g. radar, sonar,\r\nultrasound).\r\n\r\nThe mathematical theory of inverse scattering includes powerful\r\nmethods for deducing the material properties of an object from data\r\nmeasured in a remote sensing experiment. However, there are many\r\npractical applications where it is impossible to make observations at\r\nsufficiently many frequencies and angles to apply these methods. In\r\nthis project, we focus on understanding those aspects of size and\r\nlocation that can be unequivocally identified from limited data sets,\r\nand developing algorithms to stably compute these sizes and locations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
