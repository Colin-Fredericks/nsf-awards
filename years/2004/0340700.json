The primary goal of this workshop of French and American scientists and graduate students is to promote and coordinate cooperative activities in post-genome sequencing.  The participants previously met in Lyon, France in 2002 to discuss the sequence and annotation of the Erwinia 3937 genome.  The Wisconsin 2004 workshop will cover the following topics: how to keep the genome annotations up-to-date as new information about genome functions is obtained and how to design and obtain resources such as DNA microarrays that will be useful to the entire community of Erwinia biologists.  In addition, the meeting will provide an opportunity for Erwinia biologists to plot a course for future genome-scale research. \r\n\r\nErwinia chrysanthemi is a pathogenic bacteria associated with soft-rot and wilt of a wide variety of plant hosts.  It generates heavy economic losses because it can destroy major crops like potatoes, carrots, and endives.  In addition, E. chrysanthemi is a model for the study of several fundamental bacterial mechanisms.  Comparisons with related animal pathogens will further understanding of survival mechanisms, causes of bacteria-related disease, and identification of genes implicated in plant/bacteria interactions.\r\n\r\nThe workshop, co-chaired by Nicole Perna of the University of Wisconsin and Guy Condemine of the Institut National des Sciences Appliquees de Lyon, is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS).  NSF will provide support to the U.S. participants, including a cohort of graduate students.  The CNRS will cover the travel costs of the French researchers.  \r\n",
