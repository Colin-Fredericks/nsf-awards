Libgober\r\n\r\nThe proposal studies several topics in the topology of algebraic\r\nvarieties and singularity theory.  The author plans to consider\r\nthe vertex operator algebras attached to possibly singular\r\nalgebraic varieties.  Vertex operator algebras were attached to\r\nnon singular varieties by Malikov, Schechtman and Vaintrob and to\r\norbifolds by Frenkel and Szczesny. L.Borisov and author's work on\r\nelliptic genera suggests that one may expect such algebras for\r\nvarieties with Gorenstein log terminal singularities. These\r\nvertex operator algebras will provide new invariants of algebraic\r\nvarieties which role should be investigated. These new algebras\r\nshould provide further clarification of McKay correspondence\r\nbetween the group actions and singularities. The author plans to\r\nstudy new Chern class type invariants for singular varieties\r\nwhich are suggested by the joint work with L.Borisov.  Secondly,\r\nthe author works on finding connections between the conformal\r\nfield theory and others approaches to mirror symmetry and, as\r\npart of this, he plans to study the relationship between elliptic\r\ngenera and other invariants of vertex operatror algebras attached\r\nto manifolds and homological mirror symmetry.  Thirdly the author\r\nproposes to study connection between the elliptic genera and\r\nisolated singularities and possible applications to Herling's\r\nconjecture on properties of spectra of isolated singularities.\r\nFinal part deals with problems about the topology of the\r\ncomplements, the Alexander type invariants introduced by the\r\nauthor and the connections with the invariants introduced in\r\nprevious parts of the proposal.\r\n\r\nWork on this project will clarify new mathematical structures\r\nwhich appeared recently in theoretical physics and in particular\r\nin string theory. It fits into ongoing process of restructuring\r\nthe scope of mathematical problems and methods for their\r\nsolutions.  The puropose of this research is to find applications\r\nof the new structures which emerged in theoretical physics to a\r\nwider range of previously unsolved problems and to expand\r\nconnections between mathematics and physics. It will bring new\r\nmethods into areas of mathematics such as singularity theory\r\nwhich already proved to be important link between theoretical\r\nmathematics and science and engineering.  Work on this project\r\nwill help to upgrade the instructions at UIC on graduate and\r\nundergraduate level to the level fully representing frontiers of\r\ncontemporary mathematics.\r\n",
