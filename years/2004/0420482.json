 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant provides funds for the acquisition of a tribometer.  A tribometer is a device for measuring friction and wear of materials that are in contact.  Measurement of the relative movement between materials results in useful information for understanding basic scientific phenomenon and to improve product performance. This particular tribometer instrument is a micro tribometer with special capabilities to perform measurements at the micrometer to nanometer level. This equipment will be used for research and education programs in manufacturing, mechanical, and materials engineering.  Specific research to be performed with this instrument includes: manufacturing and material removal, materials characterization, friction, lubrication and wear.  Measurements of mechanical and material properties will be applied to bulk materials, thin film and surface coatings.\r\n\r\nThis equipment will make it possible to study phenomena at the micrometer to nanometer size scale.  Many new advances in science, engineering, and technology are occurring at this size scale.  Examples include nanotechnology, biotechnology, and microelectronics.  Improved understanding of these complex systems and processes will lead to more efficient manufacturing systems and improved product design, in semiconductor manufacturing, coated paper and fibers, and pumps and seals for fluid handling systems.  Faculty, students and industrial partners will jointly participate in the use of this instrument.  Students, both undergraduate and graduate, will gain hands-on experience in using state-of-the-art instrumentation in the classroom, laboratory, and research.  Industry will benefit from the availability of this instrument to perform measurements and access to faculty and students knowledgeable of this area of technical specialization.",
