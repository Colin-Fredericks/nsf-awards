GolovinCostas Grigoropoulos\r\nAffiliation:  \tNorthwestern UniversityUniversity of California-Berkeley\r\nProposal Title: \tCollaborative Research:  Studies of explosive crystallization\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nExplosive crystallization of amorphous materials is a fascinating phenomenon that has attracted much attention from engineers, physicists, materials scientists and others for over two decades. It manifests itself as a thermally activated, highly exothermic phase transition of a solid material from a metastable amorphous state to a stable crystalline state, that occurs in the form of a self-propagating crystallization front. The front  propagation can be triggered by a local heat rise produced mechanically, or by a laser  beam. The laser-beam-triggered explosive crystallization of amorphous semiconductor films is a widely used modern technology for producing silicon-on-insulator structures that have many applications in various photovoltaic devices like solar cells or infrared detectors, low-cost, low-power consuming at panel displays, etc. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the proposed project is to initiate and develop a fruitful collaboration between the theoretical group at Northwestern and the experimental group at Berkeley, to carry out systematic theoretical and experimental investigations of several important aspects of explosive crystallization that have not been previously studied. The collaboration will focus on mathematical modeling and experimental studies of nonlinear\r\ndynamics of instabilities exhibited by explosive crystallization fronts and the resulting microstructures. Specifically, we propose to investigate the stability and nonlinear dynamics of explosive crystallization fronts in several different modes of frontal propagation, as well as explosive crystallization in alloys and the effect of dopants on the crystallization dynamics. From the fundamental point of view, the significance of the proposed research is in elucidating such important effects as the instabilities and nonlinear dynamics of explosive crystallization fronts in several modes that provide examples of complex nonlinear behavior in systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium.\r\nFrom the technological point of view, the results will enhance our understanding of the modern technological process of explosive crystallization in thin amorphous films. The established collaboration will allow us to move further in our future joint research to more detailed investigations of microstructure in explosively crystallizing materials which is a necessary prerequisite to control and optimization of the process. The broader impact of the proposed research lies in its interdisciplinary nature, its importance for both\r\nscientists and engineers. It will also create a sound basis for training graduate students in future stages of the collaborative research that will provide them with the unique opportunity to participate in important research at the cutting edge of engineering, applied physics and applied mathematics, combining both theoretical and experimental components.\r\n\r\nThis research has been funded jointly by the Division of Mathematical Sciences in the Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate and the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems in the Engineering Directorate.
