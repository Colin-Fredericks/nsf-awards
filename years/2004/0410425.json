 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe foci of this research involve three areas.  First, three methods will be used to understand the modes of deactivation of ruthenium alkylidene catalysts:  Rates of the decomposition as a function of condition, additives and ligand structure will be determined.  The products of decomposition will be investigated using crystal structures and isotopic labeling.  A variety of new 1,3-disubstituted-4,5-dihydroimidazol-2-ylidene and related systems, designed to inhibit decomposition pathways, will be prepared.  Second, methods for the preparation of nanoscale layers of conjugated materials and the synthesis of multilayer materials using block polymer techniques will be developed.  Third, methods for the preparation of cyclic polymers will be developed and a variety of interlock polymer topologies will be synthesized.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program and the Polymers Program are supporting the research of Dr. Robert H. Grubbs in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology.  Professor Grubbs will focus his work on developing a family of ruthenium based metathesis catalysts that have well defined parameters at the fundamental level and that are highly efficient as well as selective.  Further, the fundamental principles required to produce a variety of nanoscaled materials with very narrow dispersities, especially materials containing inorganic structures will be explored.  Research aimed at the preparation and characterization of cyclic polymers will also be carried out.  The project presents an excellent venue for the training of students and has important broader impacts for the pharmaceutical industry and materials science.\r\n",
