 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tutorials  in  Introductory  Physics is a research-based curriculum that has been demonstrably effective at improving students' conceptual understanding when introduced in lieu of a standard recitation section in the introductory calculus-based course.  The project is creating a set of fifteen laboratories, some of which  are  based on Tutorials.  Others are based on new and existing research into student understanding of three areas: conservation of energy and momentum, vectors, and torque and rotation.  The laboratories then undergo an iterative development cycle of research, evaluation, and implementation and are being tested at 6 universities that serve diverse student populations.    \r\n  The intellectual merit of this project includes goals to (1) contribute to efforts to understand the needs of different student populations; (2) widen the impact of research-based curriculum, improving the introductory physics course on a national scale; (3) build upon proven curricular materials; and (4) develop assessment instruments for specific topics that are currently inadequately addressed by existing instruments. \r\nThe broader impact of this project is to (1) broaden the research base for effective curriculum development in introductory physics; (2) disseminate the results of research on the teaching and learning of physics; (3) model effective laboratory  pedagogy to physics faculty  and teaching assistants; (4) serve women, underrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities with aspirations for careers in science-related fields; and (5) provide a laboratory experience involving the process of scientific inquiry. \r\n",
