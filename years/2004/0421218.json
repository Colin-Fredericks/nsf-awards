 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to establish a millimeter-wave high frequency electronic device characterization system. To meet the demand for increased information bandwidth and operating frequency, scientists and engineers are trying to understand the issues associated with various electronic devices operating at millimeter-wave frequencies. In the near future, the reduction in device feature sizes will result in the use of millimeter-wave frequencies in many communication systems and computers. University of Florida will use the proposed electronic device characterization system, including a 67GHz network analyzer, a 50GHz spectrum analyzer, and an existing high frequency probe station to establish research and educational programs that will benefit our nation's millimeter-wave industry for next 10 years.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of the electronic device characterization system will benefit many interdisciplinary research programs such as RF/High-Speed System-On-Chip Integration, High-Performance Computer Architecture, Wireless Sensors, and Advanced Devices and Circuits in Silicon and III-V Technologies. The equipment will be used to advance knowledge of materials, devices, circuits, and systems across multiple disciplines in different departments. The project will also make impacts on advancing multidisciplinary research and training of graduate and undergraduate students. Students from different disciplines will have opportunities to learn how the new materials and device technologies improve electronic device performance, and how to use the instrument to characterize device performance. The project will benefit many minority students in UF and reach out to state and nation's engineering community.\r\n\r\n",
