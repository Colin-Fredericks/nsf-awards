 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coastal geomorphic-depositional systems represent the dynamic response of \r\nsediments to forcing  mechanisms that operate across  a range of spatio-temporal scales.  \r\nCharacterizing these systems is important for meaningful prediction in both modern coastal \r\nsystems and for accurate stratigraphic interpretation of ancient analogs.   In carbonate \r\ndepositional systems,  general sedimentologic criteria indicative of different facies  are well \r\ndocumented, as are the  general factors that control the regional distribution of these facies on \r\ncarbonate platforms.  What remains unclear are  the details of the landscape-scale  geomorphic \r\nand sedimentologic patterns within individual facies belts and bodies, the processes that \r\ninfluence these patterns, and possible feedbacks between process and product.   In examining \r\nhow sediments build  into geomorphologic features which  eventually may become the \r\nstratigraphic record, this intermediate scale represents a fundamental .missing link. between \r\ndocumentation of carbonate sediments and study of carbonate stratigraphy. \r\n  To begin to fill this basic gap in understanding, this study proposes quantitatively \r\nexamining the landscape-scale patterns and processes within some Bahamian ooid shoals, one \r\ncarbonate depositional environment.  Beyond the fact that these systems and the ooids forming \r\nthem are inherently interesting, the locations chosen for this study also: a) have ancient analogs \r\nthat form important water and hydrocarbon reservoirs; b) include ubiquitous lobate forms, \r\ngeometries broadly analogous to some siliciclastic environments, allowing explicit comparison; \r\nand c) include lobes in both open-shelf and tidal delta settings, to permit assessing the generality \r\nof process-response dynamics in different conditions.   \r\n  We  outline  data  collection  and  experiments  to  test  several  linked  hypotheses  related  to \r\nmodern carbonate ooid shoals and deltas,  including: 1)  at the  landscape scale, the \r\ngeomorphology of shoals is closely linked to spatial patterns of fluid flow;  2) the grain size, \r\nsorting, and type varies systematically and predictably within this hydro-geomorphic framework; \r\nand 3) lobes are a dynamically stable  geomorphic configuration in many tide-dominated \r\ncarbonate sand bodies in both tidal deltaic and more open shelf tide-dominated conditions.   \r\n  To  address  these  hypotheses,  this  research  will  integrate  remote  sensing,  bathymetric, \r\ngrain  size  and  sorting,  grain  type,  and  fluid  flow  data  in  a GIS,.    In  providing  for quantitative \r\ncharacterization of these landscape-scale patterns and links to processes, these data will represent \r\nsome of the first such analyses in carbonate systems.  In exploring patterns and processes within \r\noolitic  tidal  systems,  this  study  will  provide  first-order  predictive  trends  in  morphodynamic \r\nevolution of shoals (.creating geobodies.) and quantitative links between geomorphic framework \r\nand grains (size, sorting) within shoals (.grains within geobodies.). \r\n \r\nBroader impacts.  The application of new remote sensing, bathymetric and fluid flow analytical \r\ntools and quantitative integration of these data in a GIS represents a novel approach to study of \r\nlandscape-scale sedimentologic-geomorphic systems.  This approach should be broadly \r\napplicable to other environments, and we expect it will lead to a deeper understanding of \r\ngeomorphic-depositional systems in general. \r\n  In addition to training a Ph.D. student, this project includes educating underserved high \r\nschool minority students about science, enhancing understanding of technology and environment \r\nin the local Bahamian  community, and providing new learning tools and  experiences for \r\nUniversity of Miami students.",
