 "awd_abstract_narration": "Identifying skeletal features in the hands and wrists of early fossil hominid species (humans and their closest bipedal relatives) that may predict stone tool-making capabilities is of interest to anthropologists, because stone tools are found in fossil deposits where more than one hominid species has been recovered. Chimpanzees have traditionally been used as a model for early hominid hands because of their close genetic relationship to humans and their use of tools in the wild.  Capuchin monkeys, less closely related to humans, rival chimpanzees in their tool-using abilities in captivity.  Capuchins are unique among monkeys in that they frequently pound objects against trees in the wild.  Pounding may be pre-adaptive for tool-making behaviors; therefore, capuchins may provide an alternative nonhuman primate model for identifying features in the fossil hands of early hominids that reflect stresses on the hand associated with pounding and forceful manipulation of stones.\r\nThe question addressed by this study is whether there are features of capuchin hand muscles and bones that reflect their distinctive manipulative behaviors.  The answer will be approached as follows. First, relative cross-sectional areas of cadaver hand muscles will be compared in Cebus apella (tufted capuchin) and Saimiri sciureus (common squirrel monkey, a close relative of capuchins).  Cross-sectional area reflects a muscle's potential to exert force and is estimated by measuring its volume and its fiber length.  Second, relative leverage of these same muscles (i.e., their lever arms) will be estimated by passively moving each hand joint while simultaneously measuring (1) the joint's full range of motion and (2) the distance moved by the muscle tendon crossing the joint. These measurements will allow estimation of each muscle's potential to exert torque, i.e. the relative ability of each muscle to rotate a bone at a joint.  Finally, skeletal features that reflect relative areas and lever arms of these muscles will be identified, described and measured, where possible.  It is predicted that capuchins will have some hand muscles that are capable of generating relatively greater torques than in squirrel monkeys, and that these muscles will be associated with distinct skeletal features. \r\nThese data are essential to analysis of manipulative capabilities. They have not been previously obtained for either species. Once muscles with large torque potentials have been identified in the capuchins, these muscles can be tested in a future study using electromyography, to determine whether they are indeed strongly recruited during pounding behaviors. \r\nTraining in the techniques and interdisciplinary approach used in this study will be offered to other researchers at workshops, to undergraduate and graduate students at Arizona State University, and to high school students, including underrepresented groups, at open houses sponsored by the IGERT Neural & Musculoskeletal Adaptations in Form & Function program (NSF#9987619) at Arizona State University, to which both the PI and Co-PI are attached.  Broad dissemination of the collected data, techniques, and interdisciplinary approach will allow for research collaborations worldwide to use the capuchin as an alternative nonhuman primate model in clinical research on hand function.\r\n",
