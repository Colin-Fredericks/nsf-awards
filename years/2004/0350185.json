 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues a series of laboratory studies investigating fundamental properties, behavior and characteristics of the tropospheric sulfur cycle.  The major objective is to further studies of the mechanisms and rates of biogenic reduced sulfur compounds through gas- and aqueous-phase oxidation pathways.  Sulfur species are abundant in the remote marine lower troposphere and likely play important roles in biogeochemical cycling, new particle formation and global climate.  Results from this study will offer improved insight on defining these roles explicitly and in doing so further improve constraints on the global sulfur budget.  Experimental and theoretical elements are involved.  Laboratory kinetic studies will use laser flash photolysis and turbulent flow tube techniques with detection by a variety of state-of-the-art spectroscopic measurement/analysis techniques, including Chemical Ion Mass Spectrometry (CIMS).  Some theoretical ab initio mechanistic calculations in parallel and complementary to the experimental approach will also be conducted.  The broader science impact of this fundamental research will be important to advancing our understanding of the chemistry and cycling of sulfur in the ambient atmosphere, with further implications for better assessing the role and impact of such processes on global climate.  The research is highly integrated with education and outreach.  The project supports two full-time graduate students and a number of undergraduate research assistant paid hourly.  Participation in this project will contribute substantively to their research training and professional development.",
