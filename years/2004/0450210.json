 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Stanford University is proposing to organize the Multifunctional Materials and\r\nStructures Workshop on October 29-30, 2004. The workshop will be co-sponsored by the\r\nNational Science Foundation, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, and the Army\r\nResearch Office. The major theme of the workshop is focused on multifunctional composites with automomic capabilities. Particularly, attention will be given on composite materials with engergy storage capability, with self-diagnostic capability and self-sening capability.  The Stanford University will be providing administrative support to this special Workshop.  The total budget of $ 32,500 is proposed to a consortium of AFOSR, ARO and NSF to cover  such costs as: (a) travel and lodging subsidy for the workshop speakers, (b) renting of a  meeting room, (c) refreshments and banquet expense for all participants; (d) staffing and the preparation of the Workshop proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will provide the research community a unique opportunity to examine the current state-of-the art technologies in the field and to discuss urgent needs in new technology development with industry representatives. The workshop will provide a forum to further fertilize the development of innovative technologies in the field.  The workshop will provide a unique opportunity for researchers, educators, and trainers to interface directly with industry representatives and government funding agents across many application fields, ranging from civil infrastructures and ground-space-undersea transportation systems, to bio medical devices.\r\n",
