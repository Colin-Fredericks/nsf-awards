 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this research is to advance technology and training through education and research in highly interdisciplinary, state-of-the-art research thrusts. The areas of research are (1) integrated electroactive sensors, (2) self assembled-nanostructures and (3) biochips. The key equipment acquisition that we are seeking remains essentially intact, the SOLUTION deposition system manufactured by CHA Industries.  It will deposit noble/biocompatible metals, refractory metals and dielectrics for fabricating ultra-thin electrodes for polymer sensors, quantum dot formation for our innovative self-assembled nanostructures as well as biocompatible electrodes for biochips.\r\nThe intellectual merit of this research thrusts are (1) nano and biotechnology research are major national initiatives, (2) integrated sensor systems pervade industrial, medical and military systems, (3) VCU has established research prominence in; electroactive \"smart\" polymers; sensors integrated with CMOS; unique self-assembled quantum dots for quantum computing; novel implantable biochips; living-cell-biosensors; and the electronic nose and (4) VCU's state-of-the-art facilities provide the necessary infrastructure for accomplishing these research goals. The broader impact of the proposed activity is that it will: (1) provide a key new capability to an already extensive infrastructure, (2) expand technologies available for cutting-edge undergraduate education teaching and research, industrial partnerships and graduate research, (3) enhance infrastructure available to industrial and academic partners, (4) advance technological teaching and research to under-represented groups in an urban population distribution with high gender parity and (5) benefit society as a whole by enhancing the quality of all our lives, through technological advances in the fundamental areas of safety, security, and health.\r\n",
