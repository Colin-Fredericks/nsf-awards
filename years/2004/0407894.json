 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract DEB 0407894\r\n\r\nPassiflora (the Passionflowers) comprises more than 520 species of\r\nvines or small trees with highly specialized flowers that occur in tropical\r\nhabitats worldwide. Most diverse in the New World, they are represented in\r\nthe Old World by only about 22 uncommon and poorly known species from Asia\r\nand the Austral-Pacific region. Preliminary phylogenetic study indicates\r\nthat those 22 species descended from a single common ancestor, thus forming\r\na natural group (supersection Disemma). This group differs from other\r\nPassionflowers in its floral development, unusual leaf arrangements, and in\r\nthe diverse array of sugar-producing nectaries found both in the flowers and\r\non leaves and stems, meaning that an understanding of character patterns in\r\nthis group is essential to understanding patterns of diversity in the genus\r\nas a whole.  A broad approach will be employed to reconstruct phylogenetic\r\nrelationships among the species, using characters from morphology and\r\nanatomy of flowers and vegetative structures and nuclear and plastid gene\r\nsequences.  Nectaries will be studied by comparing gene expression among the\r\nvarious forms to address the question of whether they share an underlying\r\ngenetic basis.  A monograph for the section will be completed that will\r\npresent revised species circumscriptions, illustrations, distribution maps,\r\nand keys to facilitate identification of these species, forming an essential\r\nbasis for conservation efforts for the group.\r\n\r\n      The project has impact far beyond serving as a dissertation study.\r\nThe Passionflowers are popular subjects for horticulture and therefore the\r\nresults of this work can have implications for commercial growers and\r\nhobbyists.  Extensive collaboration with researchers in Central and\r\nSoutheast Asia is an integral part of the study. Individuals from botanical\r\ngardens and universities in Yunnan, Guangdong, and Hainan provinces of\r\nChina, as well as Vietnam, Thailand, India, and Papua New Guinea will be\r\ninvolved in the acquisition and study of these species, strengthening ties\r\nbetween US and foreign institutions. Collaboration provides an opportunity\r\nfor all parties involved to learn about the practical aspects of conserving\r\nhabitats and the rare species found within them. The monograph, including\r\nidentification tools for Disemma, will be made available to the public\r\nbroadly via the World Wide Web. This information will allow identification\r\nof rare species of Passionflowers in the wild, facilitating conservation\r\nefforts at the level of local management authorities. Live material\r\ncollected in the field will be cultivated and distributed to botanical\r\ngardens in the United States, forming the basis for ex situ conservation\r\nefforts.  Preserved field collections will be distributed to herbaria,\r\nincreasing resources for future workers.  The developmental study of\r\nnectaries will provide a model for how genetic techniques can be used to\r\nprobe morphological diversity.\r\n",
