 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this CAREER award is to develop a set of simulation and design tools so that self-assembly can be engineered and systematically applied in diverse material systems for patterning nanostructures on solid substrates. Specifically, the effects of several forces and interactions present in diverse material systems and significant in molding nanoscale structures will be investigated, including 1) surface stress and epitaxial stress, 2) surface electric charges and dipoles, and 3) electric double layers on semi-conductors. By modeling and simulating the self-assembly process induced by these forces, the research work will develop a class of methods to control the process based on manipulation field design. Thus a self-assembly process can be programmed to produce highly uniform nanostructures with desired size and spatial arrangement. A critical challenge in nanotechnology has been to mass-produce the desired nanoscale structures economically. The advancement of nanofabrication technology calls for the exploration of innovative methods and the development of advanced simulation and design tools. A long-term goal of the proposed work is to establish nanoscale self-assembly, nanostructure design and nanofabrication as a unified science-based discipline. As an enabling technology, the outcome of the work will benefit a wide range of scientific disciplines and push the frontier in nanoscale science and technology.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the education plan is to prepare the engineering student to meet the ever-increasing educational demands of the rapidly-growing nanotechnology field. Using the on-campus information technology resources, the proposed work integrates the emerging nanostructure evolution and self-assembly research into the classroom. The PI plans to establish an interactive virtual lab for nanoscale phenomena and processes. Thus students, researchers or general public can perform numerical experiments by simply adjusting various input parameters. The solution will be visualized on the web browsers via a graphics interface, thereby allowing the users to understand the underlying concepts while minimizing their learning effort.\r\n",
