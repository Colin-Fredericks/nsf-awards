The goal of this workshop is to assess the state of the art\r\nin the development of algorithmic tools for simulation of large\r\nmolecules.  Molecular simulation is now a standard tool for studying\r\nvast plethora of chemical processes ranging from applications in\r\nnanotechnology to the identification and prediction of biomolecular\r\nstructure and function.  To date, many challenges have been addressed\r\nin an incomplete manner, and there is a continuing demand for high\r\nquality algorithms and supporting mathematical theory for high\r\nperformance computations.  The principal topics of the meeting are\r\nalgorithms for force evaluation, integration, optimization, and\r\nsampling; methods for structure prediction, reaction paths, free\r\nenergy profiles and conformational dynamics; modeling of force fields\r\nand implicit solvents; and multiscale techniques for quantum-classical\r\nand classical-elastic models.  Exchange of information about the\r\nlatest results stimulates research progress and avoids duplicate\r\nefforts, especially because there are infrequent international\r\nmeetings devoted to this topic.  Even more, it makes chemical and life\r\nscientists aware of valuable computational and mathematical\r\ntechniques; and at the same time, it makes mathematical scientists\r\naware of the specific nature of the problems and exposes them to\r\ninsights into their solution.  The program for the meeting, including\r\nabstracts and a report of the open discussion, is made available on\r\nthe web.  The meeting consists of plenary talks by leading experts,\r\nparallel talks by junior and senior researchers, and a structured\r\ndiscussion session.  Most of those supported by this grant are junior\r\nresearchers or members of underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nComputer simulations can provide information about the geometry and\r\nbehavior of biomolecules and other large molecules that is difficult\r\nto obtain experimentally.  Such information is central to\r\nbiotechnology, materials science, and nanotechnology.  However,\r\ncurrent computational methods often consume up to weeks of computer\r\ntime and are often of limited reliability.  To consider these issues,\r\nthe investigator and his colleagues organize the multidisciplinary,\r\ninternational workshop \"Algorithms for Macromolecular Modelling\" on\r\nAugust 18-21, 2004 at the University of Leicester in the United\r\nKingdom.  The purpose of the workshop is to stimulate research on the\r\nconstruction of yet faster and more reliable methods for\r\nimplementation in simulation software.  This is best achieved by\r\ncombining the expertise of mathematical scientists with the physical\r\ninsights of chemical and life scientists.  This workshop is almost\r\nunique in the emphasis that is gives to both the needs of the science\r\nand the mathematical details of the simulation software.  The meeting\r\nconsists of plenary talks by leading experts, parallel talks by junior\r\nand senior researchers, and a structured discussion session.  This\r\nproject supports travel for United States participants in the\r\nworkshop; most of those supported are junior researchers or members of\r\nunderrepresented groups.  The results of the workshop are disseminated\r\nthrough a dedicated website.  In addition, the collected scientific\r\narticles by the invited speakers will be published in Springer\r\nVerlag's Lecture Notes series in Computational Science and Engineering\r\n(LNCSE). \r\n",
