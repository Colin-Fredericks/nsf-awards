 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Electrical Engineering (EE) and the Center for Applied Electromagnetic Systems Research (CAESR)  at The University  of Mississippi  (UM) seeks  support  from  the National  Science  Foundation  to  acquire near-field  antenna  range  instrumentation  which  will  be  dedicated  to  support  ongoing  research  on  antennas  and scatterers  in  the  commonly  known  technology  areas  of  RF, wireless, microwave, millimeter wave,  infrared,  and optics.  The equipment will be used to pursue studies of new, innovative antennas and scatterers, and large planar phased  array  antennas  for  research  projects,  including  studies  of  dielectric  resonator  antennas,  printed  antennas, cylindrical  wire  antenna  scatterers  in  multi-layered  media,  radar/sensor  antennas,  spatial  power  combiners,  and meander and spiral antennas for wireless communication.  This instrumentation is needed because EE and CAESR do not currently have capability for large aperture antenna measurements. \r\n \r\nUM EE programs supporting this research have grown to an enrollment of about 100 undergraduate  students and over 45 graduate students with a faculty having 11 tenure track, instruction/research positions. The department research areas are in electromagnetic applications and telecommunications.  Seven faculty members are in the area of  electromagnetics  and  their  research  will  benefit  from  these  facilities.  In  addition,  two  professors  emeritus  of electrical engineering who are very active in research and RF measurements will be using this instrumentation. \r\n \r\nIntellectual  Merit:  The  research  objectives  are  1)  to  continue  investigation  of  developing  new DR  antennas with wideband performance and to study the performance of these radiators in large antenna array environments and 2)  to  investigate  technological  advances  in  providing  basic,  state-of-the-art  building  blocks  for  advanced  phased array radar systems.  \r\n \r\nCurrently, design and construction of new and innovative large aperture antennas are in progress, and full-scale testing is needed for design validation. This instrumentation will contribute significantly to the quality of ongoing research and will add new research capability and greatly enhance research-relate education, because UM does not have facilities for testing and measurement of large aperture and phased array antennas. \r\n \r\nBroader Impact: This equipment will have significant impact on our research and the development of highly efficient antenna arrays such as dielectric resonator antennas.  Also, this equipment will help the engagement of the University with the industry in the area and help in the economical development of the area.   As widely noted by the industry, a shortage of RF, wireless, and microwave engineers has been evident in the past few years, and this growing problem must be addressed in order to maintain the leadership of the United States in the rapidly growing and demanding information and communication intense areas in the 21st century.  The instrumentation supported by this  proposed  grant  will  provide  the  latest  technology  for  instruction  in  antenna  design  and  testing  to  facilitate technology  research  and  education.    The  graduates  of  our  program will  be  able  to  use  new methods  of  antenna design  and  be  able  to  build  and  test  large  array,  state-of-the-art  antenna  components  needed  for  RF,  wireless, microwave, and millimeter-wave systems of the future based on experiences with this new instrumentation as well as existing facilities.  \r\n\r\n",
