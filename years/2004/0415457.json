 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor David H. Waldeck, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh, is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his studies of electron transfer in supramolecular systems. The current project examines an aspect of electron transfer reactions involving both electron displacement and the displacements of atoms. Professor Waldeck will test the most common assumption, or hypothesis, that the reaction rate is controlled by either the electron's movement or the movement of the atoms. The proposed studies will test this hypothesis and develop our understanding of how electron transfer reactions evolve between these two limiting cases. This work is in an exceptionally important area since electron transfer impacts all areas of chemistry, physics and biology. \r\n\r\nWith the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor David H. Waldeck, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh, will build upon the success of his on-going NSF-sponsored research into the factors that control the kinetics of electron transfer-at-a-distance. In particular, the roles of solvent dynamics, and of intervening groups that are not covalently bonded to the donor or acceptor centers, are to be examined. These are hot topics in the electron transfer field at present, and Dr. Waldeck's research has excellent potential to make a significant contribution to our understanding of the electron transfer phenomenon, particularly in biological systems. The results of this work will be communicated through scientific conferences and publications. Student training is an essential element of this research program with particular emphasis being placed on attracting students from underrepresented groups. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in modern laser methods, spectroscopy, and nanotechnology.\r\n",
