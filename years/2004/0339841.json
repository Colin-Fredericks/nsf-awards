 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research Phase I project will develop a new class of low-dielectric constant organic polymers for integrated circuit manufacture. The chemical structure of these materials exploits newly defined molecular concepts of free-volume engineering to reach previously unattainable dielectric capacitance levels for matrix materials. The research objectives are to develop synthetic methods for the manufacture of key Iptymer(TM) polymers, manufacture lead Iptymer materials, evaluate material performance against key performance specifications, and explore manufacturing and scale-up economics. At the conclusion of Phase I, lead Iptymer materials with established performance specifications will be available for sample to potential industrial partners. The principal commercial application of Iptymer low-k dielectric materials is as interlayer dielectric matrix materials that are inserted between copper wires of integrated circuits. The lower dielectric constant of these materials will lead to faster circuits.\r\n\r\nCommercially, successful development of the materials has the potential to be used in a wide array of high performance electronics such as microprocessors and components for wireless communications. This is estimated to be a $400M market by 2006. In addition to these applications, Iptymer materials also have low refractive indices and can be used as optical coatings to enhance the brightness of displays. The economic and technical impact of reliable low-k dielectrics is considerable. Higher bandwidth processing and communication for the same cost is possible with improved materials, and every country, economic group, and industry will benefit from such advances. The societal benefits realized through the extension of electronic tools into areas where their use is now impractical or not affordable will be tremendous, even if consideration is given only to medical equipment. \r\n",
