 "awd_abstract_narration": "We will conduct an ongoing annual symposium entitled, \"Recent Developments in Neurobiology (RDN),\" to be presented at the annual meetings of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB).  The RDN symposia uses a novel form of presentation-\"piggy-back\" talks, in which the head of the invited laboratory provides the first twenty-five minutes of a sixty-minute talk to discuss the general area of significance of the laboratory's research.  The next twenty-five minute block is presented by a junior member of the laboratory, usually an advanced graduate student or post-doc, who gives specific information about the laboratory's current activities.  The final ten minutes are devoted to a common question/answer period.  The symposium papers will be published in the Society's journal, Integrative and Comparative Biology.\r\n\r\nOne of the goals of the \"piggy-back\" format is to provide experience to in-training members of the profession, in terms of symposium presentation/participation at a national meeting.  Another is to expose these individuals, and their work, to potential employers.  The symposium also seeks to provide a set of recent printed review papers to the Neuroscience community through the journal papers.\r\n",
