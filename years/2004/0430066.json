Taylor\r\n\r\nSelf-Adaptive Software\r\n\r\nAdaptive behavior is required of many classes of software systems in which untimely human responses to change are insufficient.   Self-adaptive software systems address this requirement by  continually observing themselves and their environment in order to  effect autonomous modifications to their behavior. This research aims  to develop a methodology for the development of self-adaptive software centered on ensuring a high-level of adaptation policy visibility, enforcing a strict decoupling of policy specification \r\nfrom system implementation, and supporting the independent and dynamic runtime evolution of adaptation policies.\r\n\r\nTo achieve these objectives, the design of self-adaptive systems through the integration of architectural models and knowledge-based techniques is investigated. A specification of adaptation policies \r\nbased on architectural knowledge independent from system semantics is included in software architecture models;  these artifacts are leveraged to implement knowledge-based reasoning to determine \r\nnecessary system modifications. Research results are evaluated in the context of space exploration systems, which provide a rich set of examples sorely needing self-adaptive capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis research enables the principled architecting of self-adaptive systems by elevating and specifying adaptation policies as first-class architectural elements supported by the novel integration \r\nof knowledge-based techniques for reasoning over the space defined by architectural knowledge, adaptation policy, and system modifications.",
