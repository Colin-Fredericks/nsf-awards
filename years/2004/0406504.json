Labutin, University of California, Santa Barbara\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project is dedicated to investigation of main elliptic\r\npartial differential  equations arising in\r\nRiemannian geometry, namely equations with the Monge-Ampere operator,\r\nLaplacian, and conformal Laplacian. The central question for the project\r\nis the analysis of the singular sets arising in geometric problems.\r\nIt is  proposed to approach several problems  using ideas\r\nfrom nonlinear potential theory. Let us describe the problems.\r\nThe singular Yamabe problem originates in the work of\r\nLoewner and Nirenberg, and Schoen and\r\nYau. It consists of finding conformal deformation of the\r\nmetric in a domain of a Riemannian manifold (unit sphere is the model \r\ncase)\r\nto a complete metric with  a constant scalar curvature.\r\nThe question is how to describe the domains for which it is possible.\r\nIn the case of the conformal deformation to the constant negative\r\nscalar curvature in the unit sphere   it was recently solved by PI.\r\nThe answer is that it is possible if and only if  the complement\r\nis not thin in the potential theory sense. This means that the\r\nWiener-type test with  a certain capacity holds at any point of\r\nthe complement. In the case of the conformal deformation to the zero \r\nscalar curvature\r\nthere is a strong evidence that the criterion will be  the polarity of\r\nof the complement with respect to another capacity.\r\nPI intends to verify it. Can one extend the results\r\nfrom the sphere  to general closed manifolds?\r\nUnder what additional assumptions?\r\nCan potential theory  ideas contribute\r\nto the deformation to positive scalar curvature?\r\nAnother  group of questions is related to the\r\nLiouville theorems on negatively curved\r\nCartan-Hadamard manifolds.  The  main  problem is easy to state. Does \r\nany such  manifold\r\nof dimension greater than  three with uniform  upper negative sectional \r\ncurvature bound\r\nsupport a nontrivial bounded harmonic function?\r\nPI believes that potential theory ideas\r\ncan contribute to better understanding\r\nof this question.  The solvability of the Dirichlet problem\r\nat infinity  (and hence the failure of the Liouville theorem)\r\nfor strongly negatively curved Cartan-Hadamard manifolds\r\nwas established in the works by\r\nSullivan, Anderson, Schoen, and Ancona.\r\nThere are certain similarities with the Dirichlet problem\r\nin irregular domains in\r\nthe flat space, where\r\npotential theory ideas are proved to be useful.\r\nValidity of Liouville theorems in a domain\r\nis  known to be equivalent to the polarity of\r\nthe complement with respect to the classical\r\nelectrostatic  capacity. Can one establish a similar relation for\r\nthe manifolds?  Is curvature the adequate\r\ncharacteristic of the metric for such problems?\r\nResults of Grigoryan and Saloff-Coste\r\nshow, that for a different but related question of the validity of\r\nHarnack inequality, the correct language is the Riemannian volume growth\r\nand local Poincare-type  inequalities rather than the nonnegative \r\ncurvature.\r\nIt is certain that the new methods will have to be developed for\r\nLiouville theorems. The main goal of the project is investigation of\r\nthe described problems  using the techniques which have not been \r\napplied to such problems\r\nbefore.  These are the techniques of nonlinear potential theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe area of interaction between nonlinear partial differential equations\r\nand geometry is undergoing a strong development. However, the current \r\nresearch\r\nis not primarily aimed at the questions proposed in the project. The  \r\nproject\r\nis focused on the application of the methods from\r\ntechnically difficult area of nonlinear partial differential equations,\r\nnamely nonlinear potential theory, to several concrete problems about\r\nsingularities arising in Riemannian geometry. Previously these  methods \r\nwere not\r\nsystematically applied and developed in such context. More complete  \r\nunderstanding of\r\npotential theoretic methods in geometric analysis will be  of great \r\nhelp in\r\ndetailing the way to better understanding of singularities in geometric \r\nproblems.\r\nBetter understanding of singularites of geometric objects leads in its \r\nturn to\r\nprogress in problems from theoretical physics, topology and other areas \r\nof mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
