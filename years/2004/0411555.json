 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), Xavier University of Louisiana will implement a comprehensive program to Recruit and Retain qualified minority high school students through Enriched Educational Programs (RREEP).  Studies have confirmed that, nationally, less than 10% of the African Americans receive their bachelors degrees in STEM disciplines.  Compared to the 28% minority representation in the entire population less than 5% percent are in the science and technical work force.  These small percentages can be attributed to a number of factors that include a lack of faculty mentoring, inadequate advising and, most of all, inadequacies in science and mathematics education in K-12 schools.  Xavier proposes a solution to this problem with support from NSF by following targeted goals and objectives through RREEP.  The goals of this proposal are to: i) increase the retention rate of minorities in the STEM disciplines and ii) increase the number of African American students at Xavier who major in chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathematics, or physics, and contribute towards increasing the number of African Americans entering to the work force in these disciplines.  In support of these goals, Xavier has identified specific objectives.  These objectives are to: i) increase the successful completion rate of STEM students in developmental mathematics courses from 50% to 75%; ii) increase the successful completion rate of STEM students in gate keeping courses from 60% to 75%; and iii) increase the overall enrollment in selected STEM disciplines by 60% over the next five years.  \r\n\r\nXavier University has a long tradition of success in science education (especially in the preparation of students for medical school) places it in a unique position to achieve these goals and to make a significant impact on the STEM workforce.  This proposal outlines a comprehensive program that will assist the University in achieving the above-stated goals as it adapts and enhances the successful programs already in place.  This project includes activities to: a) develop a new summer bridge program for under-prepared students b) restructure a current summer bridge program, c) collaborate with local middle and high schools through summer/Saturday workshops for science and mathematics teachers, and d) enhance/improve the pedagogy used in developmental mathematics and gate keeping courses in the STEM disciplines.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The improved instructional structure proposed will result in a higher retention rate and higher achievement levels of the students at Xavier University.  This can serve as a model for other institutions.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: The proposed Saturday workshops for in-service teachers will i) increase the knowledge and skills of the math and science teachers and ii) improve the collaborations between New Orleans area schools and Xavier University.  Furthermore, the proposed high school visitations will enhance the understanding of the career opportunities in STEM disciplines by high school students.  Additionally, this project will result in an increase in the number of minorities participating in the work force in the US in the STEM disciplines. \r\n\r\n",
