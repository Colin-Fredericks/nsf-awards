 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant proposes to develop liaison activities between the University of Minnesota, the AMTD center at Ford Werke in Cologne, Germany and the IROPROG consortium funded by the German Government.  The GOALI study will focus on techniques for developing intelligent robot programs and system control programs based on automated workplace structural maps.  Using the Denavit-Hartenberg approach, system maps using accurate geometric model of each workplace device will be developed, linked, and used to build inverse kinematic models accurate in both time and space.  A designed experimental series to evaluate reliability and accuracy of model outputs for the automated system will be conducted in the Ford Werke manufacturing facilities in Germany.   The series will include development of efficient sensor systems and provide means to assess operator usability.  The grant will further allow IROPROG to begin development of a robust test plan to assure PLC codes that can reuse existing solutions and provide fault free operations for new systems.  A significant educational component is also included.  \r\n\r\nWith project success, an automated manufacturer will be able to design any required flexible manufacturing system adaptively.  Additionally, the manufacturer will be able to perform factory upkeep tasks that result from product changes, robot structural changes or workplace equipment damage in a timely and cost effective manner.  Thus, manufacturers will be able to accommodate change, or complete damage recovery in minutes or hours instead of days or weeks.  Additionally, successful completion will further development of educational tools to teach the engineers role in the global manufacturing environment.\r\n",
