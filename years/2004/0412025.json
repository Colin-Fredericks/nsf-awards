Unfor-tunately, such Internet access Nirvana will not be available in the foreseeable future. Neither the broadband Internet nor the emerging 2.5-3G cellular data networks will provide Internet access that is at once broadband, affordable and\r\nubiquitous. \r\n\r\nThis project prototypes and deploys 7DS, a distributed system which brings us-ers a significant step closer to Internet access Nirvana. Bridging the gap be-tween the broadband Internet and the cellular data networks, 7DS exploits the increasing density of roaming devices that are endowed with both gigabyte stor-age and short-range, broadband wireless communication capabilities. Using asynchronous communication, 7DS provides a means for roaming users to ob-tain content affordably and at high peak rates; it also provides a means for roaming users to send content into the Internet, again affordably and suitable for large objects. The expected results include (i) a comprehensive prototype for 7DS, demonstrating the feasibility of the 7DS system; (ii) new algorithms and protocols for 7DS, which will be disseminated in major conferences and jour-nals and implemented in the prototype; (iii) actual deployment of the 7DS sys-tem on university campuses, demonstrating how 7DS can bridge the gap be-tween localized broadband Wi-Fi access and ubiquitous narrowband cellular data access.\r\n\r\nDr. Brett D.
