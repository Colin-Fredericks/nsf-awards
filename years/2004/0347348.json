Specific goals include fabrication and characterization of nanofluidic filters, demonstration of molecular-size sieving mechanism, and a study of the molecular charge sieving.  Understanding of biomolecule interactions with nanopores is essential for optimization and improvement of molecular separation and filtering. The proposed work will address this important issue by studying biomolecular separations in nanofluidic channels with well-defined size and shape as well as surface charge. The details of the program are well thought out. The fabrication of the nanofluidic channels with varying depths will be achieved by patterning and etching silicon wafers. The channels will be characterized by studying the dynamics of various DNA molecules and comparing the results with previous studies.  The PI outlines potential collaborative opportunities with other research groups at MIT, namely those that have expertise in areas such as confocal/two-photon microscopy and fluorescence correlation microscopy.  Nanofluidic filters represent a novel approach for biomolecular separations. In addition to potential practical applications, this technology will impact our understanding of molecular interaction and dynamics within nanostructures. The educational aspects of this program include the incorporation of biological engineering research problems in existing MIT courses, development of  a Molecular Movies website covering molecular transport and diffusion, and the development of a new lab module that covers biomolecule transport mechanisms. The educational program will propel both undergraduate and graduate education to new frontiers in biological engineering.\r\n\r\n",
