 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this renewal proposal the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support for the work of Professor Robert A. Flowers of the Department of Chemistry at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, PA.  The research will extend the PI's research on the mechanism of reaction of samarium-based reagents.  A systematic study of the influence of solvents, ligands, and additives on the reactivity of these important synthetic reagents will yield valuable fundamental data on their chemistry.  Since there are nearly 100 papers/yr on the use of SmI2 in synthesis, the proposed investigations will provide synthetic chemists with much valuable information and allow extensions into new applications.\r\n\r\nThese studies are expected to lead to broad understanding of the mechanism of lanthanide catalysis in organic chemistry.  In this connection, the PI will develop a graduate course on the applications of lanthanides in organic synthesis utilizing results from this research and from the recent literature.  This work will provide important professional preparation for students in an significant and emerging field that bridges organic and inorganic chemistry. \r\n",
