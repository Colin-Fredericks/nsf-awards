 "awd_abstract_narration": "This ADVANCE award provides funding for continued research on biomarker and isotopic (14C, 13C, 18O) analyses for paleoenvironmental and paleoceanographic applications. The PI will determine the applicability and continued usefulness of U37 as a paleotemperature estimator over a broad area of the world's oceans and investigate the 14C ages of alkenones from sedimentary environments representative of deep-sea locations where most paleooceanographic research has been conducted. The usefulness of sedimentary alkenones for detailed paleotemperature estimation and multi-proxy work has been recently brought into question by 14C evidence that post-deposition lateral transport may cause alkenones to be up to 7000 years older than foraminifera in the same deposit. Post-depotional lateral transport of fine-grained material may account for the differences. The PI will examine cores from two disparate oceanographic locations to determine if alkenones are suitable for paleotemperature estimation and multi-proxy work. The research will expand basic understanding of the interplay between carbon cycling, ocean circulation, and climate change.\r\n\r\nADVANCE awards are intended to promote the careers of women in science at critical junctures. The PI has recently relocated to the U.S. and is rebuilding her career as a researcher and educator.  \r\n",
