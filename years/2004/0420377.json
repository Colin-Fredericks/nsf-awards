The instrumentation will be housed in a new Materials Research and Education Center (MREC) and will be an integral part of a college-wide initiative promoting cross-disciplinary research in materials science.  The instrumentation is necessary to support research in three departments (Chemistry, Physics and Engineering Technology), ranging from polymer science to magnetic materials.  In addition, the requested instrumentation will affect about ten other research groups and be used in about ten undergraduate science and engineering courses.  The intellectual merit of these activities is seen in the significant contributions each makes to the knowledge base in their respective disciplines, which is particularly noteworthy when one considers that the research will be conducted primarily by undergraduate students.  This award will also have a broad impact in bridging the gap between classroom and research lab.  A considerable component of the project is aimed at training students in the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation in laboratory coursework and involving undergraduates in meaningful, cutting-edge research.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Major Research Instrumentation program will enable Western Washington University (WWW) to purchase of a suite of instruments to support a varied program of research involving faculty and students in five different research groups at WWU.
