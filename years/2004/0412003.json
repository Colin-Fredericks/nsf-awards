 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims to develop robust numerical methods and a high quality \r\nsoftware package PolynPak for solving three fundamental algebraic \r\nproblems: the univariate polynomial AGCD (approximate greatest common \r\ndivisor), the multivariate polynomial AGCD, and accurate \r\nmultiplicity-identification/root-finding. All three problems are under \r\na common assumption in application that the given data are empirical \r\nand may contain errors from measurement and rounding-off. The methodology \r\nin this project consists of a two-stage approach and the theory that, \r\nwhile GCD and multiple roots are ill-posed/ill-conditioned under \r\narbitrary perturbation, they are remarkably insensitive when perturbations \r\nare structure-preserving. Therefore, the ill-posedness can be removed by \r\nreformulating the problem in a least squares setting under a structural \r\nconstraint after calculating the structure of AGCD and multiplicity. The \r\napproach in this project may also be applicable to other ill-posed \r\nproblems in numerical computation. \r\n\r\nThis research is carried out in the fields of computer algebra and \r\nnumerical analysis where the mission is to provide the scientific and \r\nindustrial community with reliable algorithms and software for solving \r\nmathematical problems. Since polynomial is one of the most fundamental \r\nmodels in applied mathematics with a wide range of applications in areas \r\nsuch as economic equilibria, chemical reaction, image processing/restoration, \r\nto name a few, developing robust algorithms and software for polynomial \r\nalgebra, as the objective of this project, may have profound impact in those \r\napplications and in scientific computing.",
