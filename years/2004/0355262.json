 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of helium-3 through electron scattering attempts to expose\r\nnuclear physics and its underlying forces by breaking apart one of the\r\nsimplest nuclei, a bound state of one neutron and two protons, also\r\nknown as  helium-3.   The lowest bound nuclei are hydrogen, deuterium (\r\na bound neutron and proton), tritium (one proton and two neutrons) and\r\nthen helium-3.  Because deuterium has only two nucleons, it is an odd\r\nnucleus and does not represent standard nuclear material well.  Tritium\r\nis a difficult to work with, leaving helium-3 as the simplest nucleus\r\nthat has sufficiently interesting dynamics that are believed to exist in\r\nlarger nuclei.  By breaking apart these nuclei using an electron beam,\r\nthe nucleus can be reconstructed from data taken and then tested against\r\nleading theories in the field.\r\n\r\nBy working in two locations, the United States Naval Academy (USNA)\r\nand MIT, students can be trained in the handling of the helium-3 nuclei\r\nat USNA, and then later complete their education by working at the\r\nMIT-Bates laboratory during the Summer months.  The BLAST\r\n(Bates Large Acceptance Spectrometer Toroid) experiment provides these\r\nstudents the chance to participate on a world-class experiment while\r\nexposing them to new concepts and instrumentation.   The facilities to\r\nperform experiements of this caliber are unique and only a handful are\r\nin operation around the world.  The specialized features of the\r\nexperiment BLAST are that the electron beam and helium-3 targets are\r\nboth polarized in a magnetic field such that new information about the\r\nnucleus is revealed.  One particular quantity sought after is the\r\nelectric moment of the neutron, dubbed G_E_n, which describes how the\r\nneutron begins to appear as an electric moment as higher and higher\r\nenergies come to bear on the neutron.  For  this purpose, the BLAST\r\nexperiment will use both deuterium as well as helium-3 as \r\ntargets for the electrons to strike the neutrons held within \r\nthe nuclei.\r\n\r\n",
