 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit Protein folding pathway prediction is a very important problem since protein\r\nmisfolding has been identified as the cause of several diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease,\r\ncystic fibrosis, hereditary emphysema and some cancers. Furthermore, knowledge of pathways for\r\nprotein folding can give important insight into the structure of proteins. To make pathway based\r\napproaches to structure prediction a reality, plausible protein folding pathways need to be modeled\r\nand validated.\r\nOur novel approach outlined in this proposal is to start with a folded protein in its final state\r\nand learn how to unfold the protein in an approximately ordered sequence of steps, to its unfolded\r\nstate. The reversal of such a sequence then represents a plausible protein folding pathway.\r\nUsing the known structure and a fast, graph-based algorithm for recursive splitting of the structure\r\nalong its most energetically labile contacts, we are able to develop a general model for topological\r\nunfolding.\r\nWe propose to explore the effect on the folding pathway of mutations that are known to cause\r\n(or suppress) misfolding diseases, especially those associated with amyloid fiber formation. We\r\nwill calculate the distribution of folding intermediates and then compare these distributions for\r\nnatural mutatations that are known to cause amyloid accumulation in the cell.\r\nBroader Impact This proposal builds on a proven track record of success of the PIs, both in\r\ncollaborative research and educational efforts. For instance, Bystroff and Zaki have team taught\r\nNSF Chautauqua Summer Course on New Directions in Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, held\r\nanually at RPI (1999-2004). The PIs have a track record of advising and promoting research\r\nactivity in under-represented groups. For instance, both PIs jointly supervised a Native American\r\nM.S. student, and Zaki has supervised 7 femaleM.S. students. Currently he is supervising 2 female\r\nPhD students. Bystroff currently has three African-American undergraduate researchers.\r\nThe proposed work will be made publically available as a web server, and also open-source\r\nsoftware, that predicts the unfolding pathway. Two full-time graduate students will be trained\r\non this grant. Undergraduates, including underrepresented groups, will continue to play a large\r\npart in our research efforts. This proposal will support a continuing inter-disciplinary research\r\nteam, which has resulted in several joint courses and publications. Much of the preliminary work\r\ndescribed in this proposal is the fruit of this collaboration. Finally this grant will support one of\r\nthe nation's strongest teaching programs in bioinformatics.",
