The manufacturing and fundamental limitations of scaled solid-state technology lead to increasing unpredictability in the physical properties of semiconductor devices. This research proposes a new design paradigm in which uncertainty is explicitly embraced by computer-aided design tools. This will be achieved via the unified treatment of statistical modeling, analysis, and optimization. This proposal specifically aims at: (1) Developing an analysis environment for early assessment of the impact of process and device variation on circuit design. The tool will assist in making high-level decisions on the properties of new designs and technologies. (2) Developing an accurate and efficient statistical static timing analysis algorithm which will allow circuit designers to reliably verify the timing behavior of their designs and find the distribution of circuit timing yield. (3) Developing statistical circuit optimization approaches that will enable identifying superior design alternatives with respect to frequency, power, and yield. The goal of the educational part of this program is to ensure that a new generation of engineering students has a comprehensive understanding of both the semiconductor physics and technology and the algorithmic circuit design techniques. To achieve that goal, this proposal will: (1) develop two new courses emphasizing joint treatment of concepts in solid-state technology, circuit design, and computer-aided design algorithms; (2) actively recruit underrepresented students through direct outreach and targeted research opportunities for undergraduates; and (3) promote active involvement of industrial experts in teaching.\r\n",
