 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two knots are defined to be concordant if the connected sum of one with \r\nthe mirror of the other is slice: that is, if the connected sum bounds \r\nan embedded disk in the four-ball.  The set of equivalence classes \r\nforms what is called the concordance group of knots, first studied in \r\nthe early 1960s.   It is known that this group is countable, abelian, \r\nand that it maps onto Levine's algebraic concordance group, which is \r\nisomorphic to an infinite direct sum of cyclic groups of infinite order \r\nand of order 2 and 4.  The kernel of this map is infinitely generated.  \r\nA main goal of the proposal is the continued study of the concordance \r\ngroup and relationships between three-dimensional properties of knots, \r\nsuch as symmetry and genus, and their properties in the concordance \r\ngroup.  Specific topics include understanding the algebraic structure \r\nof the kernel of Levine's map (in particular the part of the kernel \r\ngenerated by knots of Alexander polynomial one), torsion in the \r\nconcordance group, and the splitting of Levine's homomorphism.  To \r\npursue this study the principal investigator will develop and apply \r\nmethods coming from the theory of Heegaard Floer homology as defined by \r\nOszvath and Szabo.  Other topics of study under the proposal relate to \r\nthe interplay between the fundamental groups of 4-manifolds and their \r\ntopological structure: for instance, a continued investigation of the \r\nHausmann-Weinberger invariant of a group, the minimal Euler \r\ncharacteristic of a closed 4-manifold having that group as its \r\nfundamental group, and its generalizations, will be pursued.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposal is the study of knots.  From a \r\nthree-dimensional perspective, questions about knots have been studied \r\nfor over a hundred years.  More recently it has been recognized that \r\nthe structure of a four-dimensional space, a four-manifold, is \r\nconnected to properties of classical knots that can be associated to \r\nthat four-manifold.  A main focus of this proposal is  the study of \r\nthose properties of knots that are of relevant to four-dimensional \r\ntopology; many of these properties are encapsulated in something called \r\nthe concordance group of knots.  Questions regarding this concordance \r\ngroup offer test cases and motivation for the further development of \r\ntechniques from general four-manifold theory.  In addition, the study \r\nof concordance brings to the fore new and fascinating questions in the \r\nrealm of classical three-dimensional knot theory, relating for instance \r\nto questions of knot symmetry and genus.\r\n\r\n",
