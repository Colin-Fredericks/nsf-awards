 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to focus on the development \r\nand optoelectronic optimization of a prototype for a new, leapfrog class of web-coatable \r\nsolar cells which are flexible with a light weight form factor, have substantially  lower absolute cost per area, and a breakthrough cost-performance.  The objective of  the project is the creation and optimization of a benchtop prototype device with an efficiency, which will represent the highest solar cell efficiency ever achieved in an organic cell.   The project's plastic solar cells are based upon a 200 nm  thick, nanoscale charge-splitting network which serves as an active layer, self-organized from solution into highly \r\nregular coatings that can be tailored to absorb most of the visible light spectrum. These \r\nsolar cells can be coated onto large-area panels without the use of lithography, vacuum \r\ndeposition, or high-temperature processes. \r\n \r\nCommercially, relative to best practice solar  cells, based  on thin  film, inorganic copper indium gallium selenide technology, this new approach has the potential to enable solar cells  with a cost per watt that is 2.5x superior to the industry's anticipated CIGS-based cell performance in 2008, an unprecedented level  with the  potential of making solar electricity economically feasible for a broad market. In addition, with key differentiating attributes including light weight, a flexible form, and a low cost per area, the technology opens up new markets and application segments.    \r\n \r\n\r\n",
