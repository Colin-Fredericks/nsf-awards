 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide travel support for approximately ten graduate students to attend the 14th International Workshop on Network and Operating Systems Support for Digital Audio and Video (NOSSDAV) to be held June 16-18, 2004 in Kinsale, County Cork, Ireland. NOSSDAV brings together researchers, developers and practitioners from academia and industry to present and discuss new ideas and future directions in networking and operating systems support for all forms of networked human interaction. From large immersive environments to portable wireless multimedia devices, NOSSDAV covers a broad spectrum of cutting edge multimedia research that strongly impacts infrastructure and the human experience. The travel award will target graduate students, since attending conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited funds. An important aspect of this grant is independently requested, but synchronized support of the National Science Foundation, VA, and the Science Foundation Ireland (SFI). The latter has given NOSSDAV 2004 a grant to cover a variety of items related to the graduate student participation.  This travel support thus contributes to initiate, develop, and foster relationships with leading international groups undertaking research in the related technical areas.",
