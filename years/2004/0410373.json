 "awd_abstract_narration": "Anderson\r\n\r\nThe investigator develops and implements algorithms for a number\r\nof classification problems in the areas of Lie algebras,\r\ndifferential geometry, and differential equations.  For each of\r\nthe problems of interest, the list of representative objects is\r\nvery large.  Therefore he encodes these classification results\r\nwithin a computer algebra system and develops software that\r\nallows for the efficient but flexible manipulation of the large\r\namounts of data contained in these classification results.  This\r\nwork provides researchers with powerful new tools to find\r\nexamples and test conjectures on a wide range of subjects.  The\r\nspecific classification problems that are addressed first deal\r\nwith the classification of low dimensional Lie algebras and their\r\nsub-algebras, the classification of vector field systems in 2 and\r\n3 dimensions, and the classification of 4- and 5-dimensional\r\nspace-times with symmetry.\r\n\r\nThe classification of mathematical structures is a central theme\r\nin many branches of mathematics.  While these classification\r\nproblems can be easy to state, the solutions are often very long\r\nand complex and therefore not accessible to the larger\r\nmathematical and scientific community.  A major component of this\r\nproject explores new nontraditional methodologies (based on\r\ncomputer algebra systems and also data-based Java applets) for\r\nthe dissemination and generalization of these results. \r\nApplications to the automated solution of differential equations\r\nare studied.  The computer software that is being developed to\r\nsupport these specific goals has applications in other areas of\r\nmathematical research and in theoretical physics.  It also has\r\ndemonstrated pedagogical value for both undergraduate and\r\ngraduate mathematics education.\r\n",
