The statistical research includes contributions to the\r\nanalysis of nonstationary spatial and spatio-temporal data, the design and\r\nanalysis of computer experiments, filtering, the statistics of extremes,\r\ndata mining, and statistical computing. These methods are adapted to large\r\ndata sets and publicly available software is available to implement new\r\nmethods for spatial data and extremes. The intellectual contributions to\r\napplications in the geosciences is equally broad and includes the\r\nintroduction of stochastic modeling for sub-grid scale processes,\r\nestimating the climatology for extreme events, the construction of\r\nspatially coherent weather generators, and statistical improvements to\r\nmethods of data assimilation.\r\n\r\nA grand scientific challenge for this century is to understand the complex\r\ninterrelationships among the atmosphere, ocean, land processes, biosphere\r\nand human activities that define the Earth System. Coupled with this\r\neffort is the need to predict changes to our environment and to translate\r\nsuch changes into more immediate economic and societal impacts.  There is\r\na corresponding challenge for statistical science to tackle the large and\r\ncomplex data sets that are now the norm in many areas of science and\r\nengineering and to leverage the rich structure and prior knowledge\r\nafforded by traditional numerical models.  Through the training of young\r\nresearchers, a vigorous visitor program and participation within several\r\nof the NCAR strategic initiatives, this work reaches a wide community\r\nof statisticians and researchers in the geosciences. In this context, some\r\nspecific problems are the design and analysis of large computer\r\nexperiments that simulate the Earth's climate, extrapolating historical\r\nmeteorological data sets to locations where they are not observed,\r\nimproving the algorithms used to make numerical weather predictions, and\r\nidentifying models that include random processes to represent complicated\r\ngeophysical phenomenon. One common element throughout this research is\r\nquantifying the uncertainty in a derived method or result. Uncertainty\r\nestimates are often difficult to obtain without a statistical treatment\r\nbut are particularly important when the analysis is subsequently used for\r\ndecision making or to assess risks.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
