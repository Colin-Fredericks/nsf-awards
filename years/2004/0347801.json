 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research program is twofold: first, to develop\r\nand apply new computational inference methods for elucidating the\r\nunderlying mechanisms of complex biological systems, and second, to\r\ndevelop and enhance a series of courses that incorporate various\r\naspects of computational biology into both the undergraduate and\r\ngraduate curricula.\r\n\r\nNetwork inference methods based on dynamic Bayesian networks are being\r\nimplemented and extended to discover models of complex biological\r\nsystems.  In addition, simulation systems capable of generating\r\nbiologically plausible data are being developed to evaluate and\r\nimprove the inference methods.  The aim is to apply the most effective\r\nmethods to real experimental data to produce models of the underlying\r\nbiological systems.  The inference methods being developed are widely\r\napplicable to biological and non-biological problems where models of\r\ncomplex systems need to be recovered from noisy or incomplete data.\r\nBoth the inference algorithms and the simulators are designed to be\r\nflexible and adaptable to other systems.\r\n\r\nInsights gleaned during the course of this research program are being\r\nfolded into new courses on machine learning and the dynamics of\r\ncomplex biological systems.  These courses are intended to accompany\r\nthe three existing computational biology courses previously developed\r\nby the PI.  Collectively, these five courses will contribute to\r\nshaping both undergraduate and graduate programs in computational\r\nbiology at Duke University.\r\n",
