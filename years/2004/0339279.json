 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project proposes to investigate the feasibility of designing and developing a low-cost mobile phone that can also be used as transit token, leveraging the wireless capabilities of the mobile phone to add token value to a transit card. Transit System Operators throughout the world are replacing their paper ticket and metal token transit with contactless smart card technologies. Financial Institutions and Transit Operators are also utilizing \"dual-interface\" or \"combi-cards\" which are smart cards that have both contact and contactless interfaces and typically contain a transit application (such as Mifare) and a payment applications (such as Credit or Debit). A wireless phone that is equipped with transit smart card and antenna creates a unique personal transaction terminal.\r\n\r\nIn the US, smart card transit systems are now in process in Washington DC, Boston, Las Vegas, San Francisco representing millions of commuters, and with mobile phone penetration in the US currently over 45%, there is a significant market opportunity for mobile phones that can be used as transit tokes or used to recharge transit smart cards. If successful this product add more capability to what could be the communication appliance of choice, the mobile phone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
