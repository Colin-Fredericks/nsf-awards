Robertson\r\n\r\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL 61801\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nThis research project is to assemble a multidisciplinary team with complementary expertise to study a class of very important material systems for nanotechnologies - carbon nanotubes and nanotube composites.  The focus of the investigation is the strong coupling between mechanical deformation and electrical response in carbon nanotubes. An integrated modeling and experimental approach is taken to study the electro-mechanical coupling in composites embedded with aligned nanotubes.  First-principle simulation tools and atomistic-based nanoscale continuum theory are used to pursue fundamental understanding of mechanical-electrical coupling effects. Experimental techniques using HRTEM/STEM in combination with EELS and FIB are used to characterize interface structures between nanotubes and matrix, and the microstructures of composites. The electro-mechanical coupling of nanotubes is measured by straining the nanotube composite specimens. The interpretation of the measurement results is accomplished by the modeling effort with an understanding of the interfacial structures and transport mechanisms between the nanotubes and the matrix. The success of this project strongly depends on the integration of the modeling and experimental efforts.\r\n\r\nThe strong coupling between mechanical deformation and electrical response in carbon nanotubes provides a unique opportunity for many potential applications such as nanoscale sensors and actuators, nano-electro-mechanical systems (NEMS), and nano-electronic devices. Understanding the coupling phenomenon in nanotubes enables possible production of smart materials and devices with sensing and actuating functions at the nano-scale. The results of the research project include basic measurement data of the electro-mechanical coupling of nanotubes, enhanced knowledge of the interface structures between nanotubes and matrix in a composite, and atomistic-based nanoscale continuum models for analyzing mechanical responses and electro-mechanical coupling of carbon nanotubes and nanotube composites.  Applications of these research results significantly improve U.S. industry's future competitiveness in nanotechnology.  Furthermore, graduate and undergraduate students trained in the project are expected to become the next generation of leaders in nano-science and nanotechnology.\r\n",
