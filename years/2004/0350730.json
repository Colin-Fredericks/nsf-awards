The techniques appeal to various fields,\r\nfrom geometric analysis to arithmetic. There are four aspects to\r\nthe project: 1) study the rigidity and arithmeticity of cocompact\r\ncomplex hyperbolic lattices, for which Margulis's superrigidity\r\ntheorem does not apply. More generally the PI is trying to\r\nconstruct a reasonable moduli space for non-archimedean\r\nrepresentations of Kaehler groups (analogous to Simpson's\r\nnon-abelian Hodge theory for archimedean representations). 2)\r\nstudy the positivity of a natural kernel on the Bruhat-Tits\r\nbuilding of a p-adic simple Lie groups.  This would lead to\r\nstrong results in the representation theory of such groups. 3)\r\nfind a short-cut to prove that non-arithmetic lattices don't have\r\nproperty T. 4) use ergodic theory to prove some cases of the\r\nAndre-Oort conjecture for Shimura varieties.\r\n\r\nThe concept of \"rigidity\" underlies many of nature's secrets:\r\ncertain natural objects (and their mathematical models, like\r\ncertain curved spaces appearing in general relativity, or certain\r\ngroups appearing in quantum mechanics) can not be deformed. A\r\nfundamental discovery of mathematical analysis was that\r\n\"rigidity\" is essentially a consequence of \"arithmeticity\": these\r\nrigid objects have a simple description in terms of sequences of\r\nrational numbers. These numbers provide the cherished invariants\r\nof modern physic. This project aims to develop new methods for\r\ninvestigating crucial occurences of such arithmetic structures in\r\nsome natural symmetry groups, their related spaces and the\r\ndynamical systems where they occur.\r\n",
