 "awd_abstract_narration": "OUTLIER IDENTIFICATION AND HANDLING IN COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY\r\nPROBLEMS\r\nComputational geometry problems arise in all areas of science and engineering, in contexts\r\nsuch as computer vision, machine learning, data mining, classification, data compression,\r\ngeographic information systems, clustering, and facility location. Advances in computational\r\ngeometry can yield advances in robotics, genomics, and proteomics, to mention three areas\r\nof pressing interest.\r\nIncreasing concern in computational geometry problems is being devoted to outliers,\r\npoints in the input data whose removal can yield significant improvements in attainable\r\noptimal values of objective functions. Recent treatments giving attention to outliers involve\r\nquite appealing methods with good results, but these have been ad hoc solutions, specific to\r\nparticular problem contexts and entailing restrictive assumptions. It would be desirable to\r\nderive such approaches in a systematic manner from general principles and guidelines, and\r\nto evaluate and compare outlier procedures on such a basis. To date, however, no systematic\r\napproach for handling outliers in computational geometry problems has been set forth, nor\r\nhas there been advanced a set of specific criteria to be satisfied by outlier procedures.\r\nThrough interdisciplinary collaboration between a computer scientist and a statistical\r\nscientist, this project will develop an outlier identification and handling approach as a new\r\nand versatile tool in computational geometry. Structures of a general nature for effective\r\noutlier identifiers will be formulated. Criteria to be satisfied and desirable qualitative features\r\nwill be formulated. Issues such as robustness of outlier identifiers will be addressed. Efficient\r\ncomputing algorithms will be developed. Significant restrictions on current approaches will\r\nbe relaxed.\r\nThe project will focus on outlier handling in shape fitting and dimension reduction prob-\r\nlems. A leading tool will be depth functions, an emerging methodology in nonparametric\r\nmultivariate data analysis that is useful for description of distributions and data sets and in-\r\nherently supports characterization of outlyingness for points in a data input. As a byproduct,\r\nthe project will obtain advances in depth function methods as well.\r\nOne proposer has been developing efficient algorithms in computational geometry, the\r\nother developing depth and outlier methods in multivariate data analysis. One proposer co-\r\norganized, and both proposers participated in, the recent NSF-sponsored Workshop on Data\r\nDepth: Robust Multivariate Analysis, Computational Geometry and Applications (DIMACS,\r\n2003), which fostered the collaboration for this research project.\r\nThe leading intellectual merit of this project is to advance the foundations of computer\r\nscience by providing a general and fundamental method that replaces ad hoc approaches to\r\noutlier handling. Also, the findings will advance the field of statistical science in the area of\r\nnonparametric multivariate data analysis.\r\nBroader impacts of the project include strengthening of the interface between computer\r\nscience and statistical science and involvement of graduate and undergraduate students\r\nwithin a team approach as part of their academic experience. Through its wide applica-\r\nbility the findings of this project will have immediate and central relevance to many areas\r\nof science, engineering and government. The PIs will maintain a web site on which project\r\nresults are made known and available to the public at large.",
