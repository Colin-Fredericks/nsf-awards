 "awd_abstract_narration": "The categories that people use to organize their social world are known as stereotypes. Research over the past 50 years has shown that stereotypes can have a powerful influence on cognition and behavior. Even the subtle activation of a person's gender or ethnic identity can produce reliable cognitive and behavioral effects. When negative or unfavorable stereotypes are activated in memory, performance can be hindered on a variety of behavioral and cognitive tasks. In contrast, the activation of positive or favorable stereotypes can improve performance. This effect is termed \"stereotype susceptibility.\" Although these effects have been clearly documented, not much is known about the mechanisms underlying them. This project is designed to test key theoretical propositions regarding possible mediators of the relationship between stereotype susceptibility and behavioral effects. It is proposed that stereotype activation alters flexible aspects of cognitive processing, especially attentional resources, task orientation, and working memory. To test these propositions, psychophysiological correlates manifested in tasks involving attention, expectations, working memory and orienting to particular stimuli will be examined with regard to their potential roles in stereotype susceptibility. Several ERP components, obtained by averaging the EEG activity across repeated presentations of a particular stimulus type, will be analyzed. The main objective is to integrate current social psychology and psychophysiology theory and research to gain insight into the cognitive processes that may mediate the relationship between stereotype susceptibility and behavior. The research should have important practical consequences and applications in the areas of education and public policy.\r\n\r\n",
