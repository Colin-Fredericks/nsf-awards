 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is awarding 29 CSEMS scholarships annually to transfer students who have completed one semester of studies at North Carolina State University.  The requirement of one semester on campus helps ensure that students have adjusted appropriately to the difficulties inherent in study at the university level.  The principle investigator team includes faculty from disciplinary departments as well as administration to ensure adequate support is provided for scholarship recipients.  The support provided by these scholarships will cover approximately 75% of the tuition at North Carolina State, enabling these students to spend more time on their studies and consequently, to be successful in their academic pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe PI teams has an excellent track record with an existing CSEMS project with a nearly 100% graduation rate.  The scholarships supported under this project require a significant GPA (3.0) and course load requirement (30 instead of a more typical 24 hours) to ensure excellent training of a new generation of students in the CSEMS disciplines.  The project supports the CSEM disciplines with a special emphasis on and support for statistics in this project.  An excellent management, assessment and dissemination plan is in effect to provide good monitoring, compliance and follow up on the project.\r\n",
