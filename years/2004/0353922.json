 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program. This award provides up to three-years of support for an REU Site at Drexel University. Ten freshman and/or sophomore-level students will be recruited for a ten-week summer experience in materials-related research. Students will have an opportunity to do research in broad areas such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, and advanced materials. Student participants will collaborate as a member of a research team and will have opportunity to participate in weekly research seminars by senior investigators, weekly demonstrations of cutting-edge research equipment, and field trips to nearby industrial and national research laboratories. It is anticipated that this program will have a Broader Impact on the nations need to increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents engaged in research-related careers. Students will specifically be recruited at an early stage in their academic development as a way to motivate and propel them into exciting careers in emerging fields of science and technology.",
