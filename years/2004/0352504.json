 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and the University of Maryland, Baltimore, in cooperation with technology education teachers and industrial collaborators, are developing modular instructional materials for students.  The materials are designed to increase the awareness of and interest in career opportunities in engineering and technology.  The modules use authentic, real-world engineering applications and hands-on experiences to build problem-solving skills and contribute to the technological literacy of secondary students.  The modules specifically target the ITEA Content Standards for Technological Literacy and related benchmarks.  Specifically, the project is developing five case studies in CD format, using real-world examples to introduce students to engineering design and decision-making processes.  Inquiry-based learning with hands-on experiences will be used to maximize student interest and understanding.  The project is conducting research to demonstrate the effectiveness of the modules in increasing technological literacy and in building awareness of and interest in engineering and technology careers.  The project is also conducting research to determine how interactive, authentic, problem-solving simulations impact and facilitate student learning.  It is also providing professional development opportunities for technology education teachers, including an overview of the program and acquaintance with the curriculum case studies prior to their use in the classroom, as well as increasing the involvement of women and other underrepresented groups in engineering and technology by providing female and minority role models in the classroom and developing case studies that encourage interest and participation by all groups.\r\n \r\n\r\n",
