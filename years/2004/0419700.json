 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I Project will combine two methods of optoelectronic sortation onto a single manufacturing platform for high speed sorting of scrap metal. The project is aimed at sorting scrap metals and alloys, both low Z and high Z, at previously unattainable accuracy and speed;however, it may be applicable to other material sorting and identification applications such as for chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and ceramic materials. The technology platform of optoelectronic manufacturing technologies for analyzing copper-rich, aluminum-rich, zinc-rich, titaniumrich, cobalt- and nickel-rich alloys at previously unachievable accuracy and high speeds into known alloys to meet smelter alloy specifications. The technology platform is not only aimed at sorting alloys into base metal groups, but can also sort a wide range of alloys by each alloy grade or type. The system is fully automatic and does not require operator intervention. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact from this project could be a new technology that potentially could revolutionize the way nonferrous metals from plants are handled. Instead of disposing of the metals in a landfill, or selling them as metal mixtures, where they will contribute to land and water pollution or be sold at low prices, they will instead be separated, refined, sorted and resold into commercial end uses as high-grade, recycled metal. This project is aimed at validating small scale, cost effective rapid sortation technology having the potential of replacing large smelting and refining operations with small scale sorting operations. The market niche opportunity represents about $2 billion of a total potential $50 billion worldwide aluminum smelting and casting market. Mixed nonferrous concentrates from these sources and mixed scrap metal from thousands of metals dealers and scrap yards will be upgraded, creating significant value. Moreover, The new technology will also reduce environmental pollution because it does not generate emissions such as those produced by refineries, metal smelters and heavy-media plants.\r\n",
