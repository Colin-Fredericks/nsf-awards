 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nOlafsson\r\n\r\nThis project deals with a variety of problems in modern harmonic analysis.\r\nIt combines ideas and problems from abstract harmonic analysis\r\nand representation theory on Lie groups related to\r\nsymmetric spaces with tools and questions well\r\nknown from classical Euclidean harmonic analysis. Our list of\r\nproblems includes a detailed study of series of representations occurring\r\nin the regular representation on Pseudo-Riemannian symmetric spaces and, in\r\nparticular,  geometric realizations of those representations using\r\ntools from complex analysis. Part of this study is the interplay between\r\nspecial functions and the spherical character of representations\r\noccurring discretely in the regular representation.\r\nOur study also includes  compactification\r\nof symmetric spaces, application of representation theory to special functions,\r\nin particular, Laguerre functions and polynomials.\r\nOn the other hand the proposal includes problems related to wavelet theory,\r\nfunction spaces on cones and other symmetric spaces, in particular,\r\nBesov spaces. The proposed work combines methods and ideas from several areas\r\nof mathematics: Complex analysis, group actions on manifolds and function\r\nspaces, in particular, Besov, Fock, and Hardy spaces, and  classical harmonic analysis. \r\nIt even borrows some ideas from applied mathematics. Parts of the proposed work will be\r\ndone in collaboration with our students as well as specialists in USA and Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nHarmonic analysis has its origin in the work of Fourier on the heat equation,\r\nwhich led him to consider the expansion of a periodic functions into superposition\r\nof trigonometric functions. This can be interpreted either as the spectral\r\ndecomposition of the differential operators with constant coefficients, or\r\nas decomposition of regular representation into irreducible representations.\r\nIn short, the subject of harmonic analysis is to study functions or\r\nfunction spaces by decomposing the functions into  simpler functions. In\r\nthe theory of differential equations this decomposition  means to  write\r\nan arbitrary functions as a sum or integral of eigenfunctions. In several\r\napplications,  as in image processing, the wavelets shows up as the basic\r\natoms used to approximate or represent the signal. If we have a symmetry\r\ngroup acting on the system, then we would like to write an arbitrary\r\nfunction as a sum of  functions that transforms in a simple and controllable\r\nway under the symmetry group, leading  to representation theory of\r\nthe symmetry group. Both aspects usually involve the study of integral\r\ntransforms and the corresponding kernel function.\r\n",
