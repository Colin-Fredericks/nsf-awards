 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThe objective of the proposed Workshop to be held in Varenna, Italy,  is to analyze the recent advances in fiber reinforced concrete materials and their applications for civil infrastructure systems in Italy and the United States, and identify potential new research areas. The Workshop will focus on materials properties, forms of deterioration and their effects on structural performance, and quantitative analysis of materials. Emphasis is placed on further basic research needed before this advanced technology can be transferred to professional practice. The main inhibitor to the application of this technology in engineering practice, both in Europe and the United States, is the lack of appropriate codes and standards as well as governmental certification. ACI and RILEM have already undertaken major efforts to refine design methodologies. The important next step would be to identify the research that needs to be done. Also, the most expedient ways need to be explored on how to use fiber reinforcement either as partial replacement of conventional steel reinforcement and in special cases to completely replace such conventional reinforcement. Advances in the technology will be discussed that document the performance of concrete structures with greatly reduced or no conventional steel reinforcement at all.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed workshop derives from the international cross-fertilization it makes possible. Both the European and American participants have made significant advances in recent years, and it will benefit both sides if an exchange of information is made possible in the productive setting of a workshop. The outcome of the workshop has the potential of a significant impact, because engineering practitioners are eager to use this new technology and apply it to improve the performance of infrastructure facilities worldwide at potentially reduced cost.\r\n\r\n",
