Eastman\r\nTitle:  REU Site:  Multidisciplinary Research in Computing\r\n\r\nThis project establishes an REU site at the University of South Caroline in the broad areas of secure and reliable software.  The initial four research topics are:  information security; secure computing for mobile code; enterprise-level network-based systems; and software agents for team software development.  An innovative aspect of this proposed project is the use of research teams consisting of computer science majors and pre-service education students.  The goal of these teams is to explore not only the research questions in a specific area but also how the research might be communicated to the research community, the public, and K-12 students.  \r\n\r\nThe site will support 8 students for a 10-week summer program of full-time research, as well as some semester research for two of the interns.  The project will also develop teaching modules during the research internships, and these modules can be used in K-12 classrooms.  The project includes a dissemination plan and funds for promoting student participation in conferences, and these conferences will be opportunities for other students and faculty to learn about this innovative program.  \r\n",
