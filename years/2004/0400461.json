 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary for award DMS-0400461 of Pries\r\n\r\nThe theory of Galois covers of the complex projective line (Riemann \r\nsphere) with given branch locus is well-understood; namely, one can \r\ndescribe the inertia groups of such a cover with Riemann's Existence \r\nTheorem and study families of such covers via their moduli spaces, which \r\nare called Hurwitz spaces. These techniques extend to covers of the \r\nprojective line over an algebraically closed field k as long as the \r\nramification is tame. However, if the ramification is wild, i.e. if the \r\ncharacteristic of the field k divides the order of some inertia group, \r\nnew phenomena occur which are much less understood. There are major open \r\nproblems involving the inertia groups and deformation theory of wildly \r\nramified covers. The PI proposes to study wildly ramified covers of curves, with the goal \r\nof answering some of these problems; in particular, the PI expects to \r\ncompute the dimension of the deformation space of a cover in terms of its \r\nramification invariants. The PI also proposes to construct moduli spaces \r\nfor wildly ramified Galois covers of curves in characteristic p and to \r\ninvestigate some of their properties.\r\n\r\nGalois theory has high appeal to a broad audience. Several open problems \r\nin this area can be explained to non-mathematicians and the topic connects \r\ndiverse areas of math. Galois theory arose classically as a means of \r\nunderstanding symmetries of equations and of classifying extensions of the \r\nrational numbers. Some of the early applications were that it is \r\nimpossible to trisect an angle, double the volume of a cube, or solve a \r\nquintic equation. The PI proposes to develop a new course on Galois theory, to introduce \r\ngraduate students to the fundamental background and active research \r\nproblems of this topic.  The PI would like to continue to lead research \r\nprograms for students; the program which the PI led in 2002 motivated \r\nseveral students (including students from underrepresented groups) to \r\npursue graduate study in mathematics. An application of Galois theory in characteristic $p$ to data-transfer codes was recently discovered.  These codes can be constructed using \r\ncurves of low degree which have many points defined over finite fields. \r\nThe PI would like to develop the connection between Galois theory and \r\ncoding theory further. Finally, the PI will continue collaborating with \r\nmathematicians in Germany and New York and will disseminate the results \r\nfrom this research through conferences and papers.\r\n\r\n",
