 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to bring to Mexico six faculty from universities and scientific institutions in the United States to participate in a 3-day short course on the biological basis of behavior.  140 graduate students and advanced undergraduates from Mexico and other Latin American countries will be exposed to diverse fields of research with an emphasis on interdisciplinary and integrative approaches to the study of animal behavior. Faculty will give students workshops that reveal the processes of conceiving, designing, and executing research projects in their respective fields.  The course will include classes, hands-on workshops, symposia, round-tables, and student poster presentations evaluated by the participating faculty.  The format of the course and inclusion of faculty from U.S. institutions is intended to promote more frequent and intense scientific and educational collaboration between Mexican and US researchers and students in the broad field of animal behavior and to provide Latin American students with intensive exposure to theoretical and practical aspects of major fields of behavioral research. Latin American students participating in the course will have the opportunity to meet and interact with potential future mentors in the U.S.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
