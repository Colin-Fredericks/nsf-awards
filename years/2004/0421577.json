 "awd_abstract_narration": "SEISMIC BEHAVIOR, ANALYSIS AND DESIGN OF COMPLEX WALL SYSTEMS:\r\nPROJECT SUMMARY\r\nReinforced concrete structural walls are used commonly as the primary lateral-load resisting system for\r\nnew and retrofit construction. However, despite the heavy reliance on wall systems by practicing\r\nengineers, recent efforts to develop performance-based design methods have not yet begun to address\r\nstructural walls. Today, engineers have few resources to consult regarding the simulation of wall response\r\nusing practical linear and nonlinear numerical models or the prediction of wall damage (e.g., concrete\r\ncrack width and concrete spalling) as a function of engineering demands (e.g., inter-story drift).\r\nIn part, the inadequacy of available performance-based design tools for walls is a result of limitations in\r\nthe available experimental data. Prior to the NEES initiative, experimental facilities were such that only\r\nsimplified loading conditions, loading histories, boundary conditions, and geometries could be employed\r\nin the laboratory. Additionally, instrumentation was such that experimental data typically include wall\r\ndisplacements and end rotations, average strain measurements and a few analog images showing damage\r\nprogression. Only a few existing experimental data characterize the response of walls with complex\r\ngeometries or subjected to bi-directional load histories. None of these data sets include high-resolution\r\nstrain fields for use in validating advanced simulation tools, nor do any of these data sets include highresolution digital images that can be used to quantify damage. No experimental investigations consider\r\nboundary conditions that simulate soil and foundation deformations.\r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\r\nThe research proposed here will advance the understanding of, and simulation tools for, the seismic\r\nperformance of slender walls through experimental and analytical investigations of wall systems with 1)\r\nconfigurations used in modern design, 2) load distributions that are representative of earthquake loading,\r\n3) and consideration of soil-structure-interaction effects. The advanced experimental capabilities of the\r\nUIUC MUST-SIM NEES facility will permit realistic simulation of these complex conditions.\r\nInstrumentation developed as part of the MUST-SIM facility makes possible high-resolution monitoring\r\nof test specimen displacement fields and such data are necessary to enable the proposed model\r\ndevelopment effort. These data will be used to advance the state-of-the-art for simulation of reinforced\r\nconcrete structures through the development of fiber-shell elements that can be used to simulate the\r\ninelastic response, including localized damage mechanisms, of three-dimensional walls. Results of the\r\nproposed experimental investigation and parametric studies using the high-resolution numerical models\r\nwill be used to advance the state-of-the-practice for design of wall systems including the development of\r\nelastic and simplified inelastic modeling techniques that are appropriate for use with commercial\r\nsoftware. Additionally, experimental and simulation data will be used to develop performance-based\r\ndesign tools that account for modeling uncertainty and link engineering demand parameters and damage\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT\r\nThe structural engineering profession recognizes that the limitations identified above represent a\r\nsignificant gap in the development and implementation of performance-based seismic design provisions.\r\nTo facilitate the transfer of the research result to practice, an External Advisory Panel has been assembled\r\nfor the project that includes prominent structural engineers and members of structural engineering\r\nsocieties. An interactive website will be developed to disseminate research results to earthquake\r\nengineering professionals, educators and students to allow real-time viewing of experimental tests. In\r\naddition to educating today's engineers, the research team will use the research process and results to\r\neducate future engineers using the tele-observation capabilities at the NEES facility and education\r\nmodules in design and analysis classes. The project team will leverage its own diversity and established\r\nprograms in the colleges of engineering to reach a diverse student population. In addition to these\r\nactivities, the team will work with college of engineering at UW, UICU and MUST-SIM group to reach\r\nK-12 students with activities such as Engineering Open House.",
