 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from a National Science Major Research Instrumentation Award, Professor Irving Biederman and his colleagues at the University of Southern California will purchase a state of the art three Tesla functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) system for the scientific investigation of how cognitive, emotional, perceptual, memory, linguistic, and motor capacities emerge from activity of the human brain.\r\n\r\nJoining Professor Biederman and his Co-PIs Z.-L. Lu, L. Itti, A. Raine, and M. Arbib as users of the fMRI system will be members of a variety of academic units including the Neuroscience Program, the Departments of Psychology, Computer Science, Biology, Gerontology, Biomedical Engineering, Kinesiology, Electrical Engineering, and the House Ear Institute, Currently the community of interested users includes approximately 30 faculty and over 100 graduate and post-doctoral students.   This on-campus facility will not only allow these research programs to proceed but will provide the capability for the development of imaging expertise within this community. The magnet will be available to researchers from other institutions as well. \r\n\r\nThe ability to probe the activity-not just the structure-of the intact human brain has been one of the great methodological advances of neuroscience in the past decade.  The instrument will provide high-resolution images of brain structures but its primary use will be to assess functioning of the brain as subjects experience various stimuli or perform various tasks while the system measures neural activity at specific brain loci in the order of a few millimeters.   Among the first of the research projects that will be launched once the system is installed is one focusing on regions of the prefrontal cortex known to modulate restraint and an appreciation of the consequences of one's own actions for individuals with and without a propensity for impulsive violence. Other studies are designed to understand how an image of a scene, never perceived previously, could be comprehended in a fraction of a section.  Another will assess whether brain-produced opiates in areas that mediate comprehension provide the perceptual and cognitive pleasure associated with novel but interpretable experiences.  Another study is motivated by the finding that neurons in monkey cortex involved in the production of certain motor movements, such as grasping, also fire when the monkey views the grasp of another organism.  This research will evaluate whether such \"mirror\" neurons might be the core imitative capacity fundamental to the evolution of language.  Still another investigation will focus on where and how \"episodic memory\"-the mental diaries of our lives-are produced and stored in the brain.\r\n\r\nPlans for the operation of the magnet, to be housed in the Dana and David Dornsife Cognitive Neuroscience Imaging Center, will include instructional courses designed to give hands-on training and research experience to undergraduate as well as graduate students.   \r\nSpecial outreach programs are designed to involve qualified high school students from the local community as part of an effort to provide opportunities for underrepresented minorities to be counted among the next generation of scientists advancing our knowledge of cognitive and behavioral neuroscience.\r\n\r\n",
