Geodesic flows are other examples\r\nof Hamiltonian systems. One of the most important problems in\r\nHamiltonian dynamical systems  is whether orbits in typical systems are stable.\r\nIn fact, the stability of our planetary system has long been an important\r\nsubject of mathematical research. Hamiltonian systems usually exhibit some\r\nextremely complicated and chaotic behavior. The proposed research will\r\naddress various problems related to stability and chaos, with research topics\r\nsuch as the Aubry-Mather theory, Arnold diffusions, chaotic behaviors and the\r\nNewtonian n-body problem. The ultimate goal is to show that typical near\r\nintegrable Hamiltonians in higher dimensions are topologically unstable.\r\nThe proposed research addresses problems with a long history and wide\r\napplications to classical mechanics, celestial mechanics, as well as areas of\r\nengineering. Professor Xia's research in Hamiltonian systems and celestial\r\nmechanics has been featured in many popular science magazines, books and\r\neven in some elementary undergraduate textbooks. Another aspect of this work, is the study\r\nof escaping and capture trajectories in the three-body problem, which may have potential applications in NASA orbit design. Professor Xia will continue to be actively involved in student training at both graduate and undergraduate level. \r\n",
