Zdancewic\r\n\r\nDistributed systems are an increasingly crucial part of modern\r\ncomputing infrastructure, yet the existing technology for ensuring\r\ntheir security and reliability is lacking.  This research addresses\r\nthe problem of building distributed systems and reasoning about their\r\nsecurity by developing programming languages that provide better\r\nabstractions for describing security policies and communication\r\nprotocols.  \r\n\r\nThe starting point for this project is existing work on security-typed\r\nlanguages, which protect data confidentiality and integrity.  This\r\nresearch generalizes these information-flow policies to make them more\r\ndynamic, enabling them to accommodate the changing environment in which\r\ndistributed systems run.  For example, dynamic information-flow\r\npolicies should integrate cleanly with traditional authentication and\r\naccess control mechanisms to provide end-to-end guarantees about data\r\nconfidentiality.\r\n\r\nThe second stage of this project is to develop language technology\r\nthat applies dynamic security policies to distributed programs. The\r\nidea for this part of the research is to develop a theoretical basis\r\nfor secure distributed computing using existing process calculi\r\naugmented with a heterogeneous trust model and the policy language\r\noutlined above.  In this setting, types describe communication\r\nprotocols, properties of which can be verified statically by the\r\ncompiler.  The result will be a programming language with a sound type\r\nsystem that aids the programmer in writing correct, security-critical\r\ndistributed programs.\r\n",
