 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nReal-time rendering with complex illumination, realistic materials, and an\r\naccurate simulation of light scattering, with the ability to manipulate\r\nparameters interactively, is the challenge addressed in this project.\r\nFundamental questions about the representation of appearance are explored,\r\nresulting in the development of a new class of real-time algorithms.\r\nSpecifically, the focus is on three main directions: (i) Mathematical and\r\nEmpirical Analysis of the complexity of appearance representations and\r\nlight transport; (ii) Computational Techniques such as fine-to coarse and\r\ncoarse-to-fine algorithms, function dictionaries, and hierarchical\r\nprincipal component analysis; and (iii) Algorithms and Systems supporting\r\ninteractive manipulation of illumination, materials, and viewpoint.\r\n\r\nComputer graphics and scientific visualization is increasingly used in\r\nareas such as simulation and training, automobile design, architectural\r\nrenderings, defense, electronic commerce, and entertainment. With today's\r\ntechnology, it is possible to create strikingly realistic images using\r\nsophisticated, but also slow rendering algorithms. These algorithms\r\ncannot address the growing need for effective methods to manipulate and\r\ninteract with 3D environments. Modern PCs can render scenes with\r\nmillions of polygons at interactive rates, but this performance comes\r\nat the cost of a considerable loss in quality and realism. This project\r\nseeks to overcome these limitations: producing highly realistic images\r\nat interactive rates.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the last thirty years computer graphics research has created technology that improves both the realism and generation speed of computer-generated images.  However, there is no widely used method for creating realistic images, and it remains difficult in practice to create realistic images.  This project aims to develop a practical method for realistic image creation that addresses the visual effects believed to be salient by the graphics and perception communities.  The method is intended to be robust, relatively simple, and to have the potential to be interactive in the next decade.\r\n\r\nThe ability to rapidly generate realistic images is useful in many applications.  For example, flight and driving simulators rely on realistic imagery, but the interactive nature of these systems limits the realism that is feasible.  The proposed work should extend these limits.  The proposed method would also be useful for generating images for planning and education; images could be created to help visualize the results of reconstruction efforts, habitat change, and urban planning.  Finally the method should be useful for generating synthetic images for input to automated vehicles, where many different scenes and atmospheric conditions could be generated rapidly and at low expense.\r\n",
