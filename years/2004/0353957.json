 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes an REU site at Texas A&M University (TAMU) in several areas of computer science research:  computing foundations, human-centered systems, information, intelligent systems and robotics, software, and software engineering and systems.  The site will engage 8 interns per summer for 10 weeks in the on-going research projects of TAMU computer science faculty.  Each intern will be mentored by a 3-person team consisting of one faculty member, one graduate student, and one undergraduate (\"peer mentoring\").  In addition to the formal research projects, the site will sponsor weekly seminars on a number of research topics.  \r\n\r\nThe PI will focus on recruitment of interns from other TAMU campuses as well as HBCU's, with which she has already established relations.  Her TAMU campus already has a summer undergraduate research program funded by the General Electric Foundation that she will leverage with this REU award to increase the number of resident interns-concomitant with an expansion of the TAMU CS faculty. Site activities will include not only the research projects; interns will also receive coaching in how to apply to graduate school.  Organized group activities will help develop a sense of community among the interns.  \r\n",
