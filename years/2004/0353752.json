 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this REU program, offered at the Chicago Botanic Garden in cooperation with Northwestern University, is on field and laboratory research in plant biology and conservation.  During a 10-week summer internship, eight students will participate in a program with the following major components:  1) Scientists at the Chicago Botanic Garden will mentor students in meaningful research projects on topics such as: plant conservation, soil ecology, plant genetics, plant ecology, economic botany, ex situ propagation, paleoethnobotany and plant demography.  Each student, in cooperation with her/his mentor, will learn the enjoyment of scientific discovery through hands-on, hypothesis-driven research activities.  2) The research staff will present a series of seminars in their respective areas of expertise to expand the learning experience of students to various allied fields of plant biology.  3) Research staff will coordinate and present a second, more formal series of tutorials and seminars on research techniques, such as quantitative methods, database management, computer graphics, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and Global Positioning Systems (GPS).  4) Student interns will actively participate in bi-weekly symposia where they present the goals and projected outcomes of their research projects.  Students will have opportunities to interact with other students in their cohort, socialize and develop public speaking skills in a friendly environment.  5) The project will offer students a variety of educational, social and cultural activities in a series of field trips to a rich array of nature preserves, historic sites and cultural institutions in the Chicago area.  6) During the final week, students will participate in a mini-symposium and present their research results in poster format.  Following the 10-week internship program, students will be encouraged to present their data at an appropriate professional meeting.  This will give students an opportunity to participate in scientific activities and exchange ideas in a national or international arena. Further information on this program can be found by contacting Dr. David L. Lentz at dlentz@chicagobotanic.org or visiting our website: http://www.chicagobotanic.org/research/index.html.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords:  plant biology, conservation, paleoethnobotany, genetics\r\n",
