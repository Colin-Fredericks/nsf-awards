 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project title: REU site on Protein Structure and Function\r\nHost Institution:  University of South Alabama\r\nParticipating departments:  This is an interdisciplinary REU site, involving faculty from the departments of Biochemistry, Biology, Biomedical Sciences, Chemistry, Microbiology and Pharmacology.  These departments are part of various academic units (Allied Health Professions, Arts and Sciences and the College of Medicine basic sciences program).\r\nOther institutions involved:  Students are recruited from various institutions in the Southeastern states including Alabama A&M, Alabama State University, Stillman College and Spring Hill College in Alabama and Tougaloo College in Mississippi and Xavier University in New Orleans, and Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. \r\nNumber of students involved:  10 students, 6 or more of them from institutions different from the host institution.  Applicants select a project from a list of 13 different ongoing studies.\r\nDuration:  10 weeks during the summer semester\r\nActivities:  Students participating in this REU site will receive a stipend and be housed on campus.  Each student is assigned to work in a research laboratory during the summer.  In addition, all participants will: i) take a one-week long course on protein biochemistry; ii) participate in eight sessions with discussions and presentations on \"Ethical aspects of Research and Research Integrity\" ; iii) attend weekly presentations by all faculty members in the REU program; iv) write a scientific report summarizing their results; v)  make an oral presentation of their results in Power Point format at a Symposium at the end of the program, and vi) discuss their progress during three informal meetings with other undergraduates from various disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis REU site is designed to provide research opportunities to undergraduates from institutions in the Southeastern US.  The goal is to stimulate critical thinking and to encourage undergraduates to consider a career in research.  A substantial number of students are recruited from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU).  This program allows undergraduates to explore in depth various research areas in proteomics and protein science, and trains them in the use of equipment not commonly available at smaller institutions.

Turrens, Ph.D.\r\nAddress:  Biomedical Sciences, UCOM 6000, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL 36688\r\nTelephone number:  251-380-2714\t\tEmail address:  jturrens@usouthal.edu \r\n",
