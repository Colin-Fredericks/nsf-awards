 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the second EarthScope Education and Outreach (E&O) workshop in August 2002 to formalize responsibilities and identify outstanding needs of the nationally distributed E&O program.  The workshop will provide more concrete direction for developing the program and sustaining it over the next decade.  The draft E&O program plan, based on recommendations from the E&O workshop and continuing community discussion, will provide the starting point for the August workshop.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will provide an opportunity for community discussion and revision of the draft program plan and for determining the appropriate mechanisms for electing the E&O Steering Committee once EarthScope is funded.  The workshop must bring together both the community of E&O providers and the community of E&O audiences.  The participants for this meeting will be chosen by the E&O Steering Committee and the Workshop Planning Group to have adequate representation of EarthScope scientific and facility leadership; state and federal geologic surveys and hazard mitigation groups; museums; parks and other informal educators; K-16 educators; education and outreach specialists; and NSF and NASA representatives.",
