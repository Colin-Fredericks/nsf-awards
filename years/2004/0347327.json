 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Next-Generation High-Sensitivity Damage Detection and Sensing Based \r\non Enhancing Nonlinear Dynamics and Phase Space Pattern Recognition \r\n\r\n Most vibration-based damage detection methods are designed for linear \r\nvibrations while far fewer apply to nonlinear systems. Many of the \r\ncurrent nonlinear methods have important limitations, e.g. difficulty \r\ntackling high-dimensional systems. This integrated research and \r\neducational program eliminates several of these limitations by using \r\na radically different approach. \r\n\r\n The main research goal is to develop robust and highly sensitive \r\nnonlinear vibration-based techniques for sensing and detecting \r\nthe location and level of multiple simultaneous damages in \r\nhigh-dimensional systems such as complex fluid-structural \r\nsystems. \r\n\r\n The main educational goal is the development of a program focused on \r\nenhancing engineering intuition with emphasis on nonlinear dynamics. \r\nThe educational effort integrates research with a broad spectrum of \r\neducational and outreach activities, and includes: (a) integrating \r\nnonlinear dynamics into undergraduate courses in engineering, \r\n(b) developing advanced undergraduate and graduate courses on \r\nnonlinear dynamics, (c) implementing outreach activities for K-12 \r\nstudents. \r\n\r\n This integrated research and educational program will provide a new \r\nand comprehensive methodology for damage detection in \r\nhigh-dimensional nonlinear complex systems. This research will make \r\nsignificant contributions to the fields of structural dynamics, \r\nfluid-structure interactions, and sensing, and it has immediate \r\npotential to impact industry because it addresses important \r\npractical engineering problems in, for instance, aerospace, civil \r\nand sensing technologies. Also, this research represents a potential \r\nbenefit to society at large, and it is strengthened by a broad \r\ndissemination to enhance scientific understanding. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
