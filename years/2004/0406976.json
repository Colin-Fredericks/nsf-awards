 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0204763\r\nKenneth Bromberg\r\n\r\nThe investigator plans to study spaces of hyperbolic metrics on a fixed\r\n3-manifold. Unlike on a closed manifold, on an open 3-manifold there will\r\ntypically be a large space of hyperbolic metrics. The investigators\r\ngoal is to understand this space. Some questions are simple to state:\r\nIs the deformation space the closure of its interior? A more detailed\r\ndescription of the space is the ending lamination conjecture,\r\nwhich gives invariants that classify every hyperbolic metric on\r\nthe manifold. This classification is not a parameterization; the map to\r\nthe space of invariants is not continuous. The investigator is\r\ninterested in understanding these discontinuities and describing the\r\ntopology of the deformation space of metrics. Hyperbolic cone-metrics\r\nare a key tool used throughout this work. The philosophy is that very\r\ncomplicated geometry in a smooth hyperbolic structure can be exchanged\r\nfor a less complicated, but singular, hyperbolic cone metric.\r\n\r\nThree manifolds are mathematical spaces that locally look like the\r\nuniverse we live in. Mathematicians, beginning with Poincare, have been\r\ninterested in classification question about three manifolds. Hyperbolic\r\ngeometry is also a very old field dating back to the middle of the\r\neighteenth century. In the last twenty-five years, largely due to the work\r\nThurston, it has been realized that there are deep and beautiful\r\nconnections between the two topics.\r\n\r\n",
