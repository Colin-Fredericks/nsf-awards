 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for RTG award DMS-0354321 of Haiman\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is to bring together U.C. Berkeley's\r\nresearch faculty in the areas of Representation Theory, Geometry and\r\nCombinatorics, along with a group of postdoctoral associates and\r\ngraduate students, in order to promote collaborative research and the\r\ntraining of young people for future work.  The three branches of\r\nmathematics addressed by this project are connected in profoundly\r\nimportant ways.  In every one of these areas, many of the most\r\nexciting current research advances involve the interconnections\r\nbetween them, so that serious study of any of them requires strong\r\nknowledge of the other two.  A central goal of the project is to\r\nprovide an environment in which postdocs and graduate students are\r\ngiven the time, opportunity and collaborative atmosphere needed to\r\nmaster a full range of techniques in all three areas.  The project\r\nwill establish two new seminars, to meet throughout the academic year,\r\none concentrating on instruction in specialized topics not usually\r\nfound in standard courses, and the other a joint seminar on current\r\nresearch.  The project will also hold an annual week-long intensive\r\nsummer workshop, featuring series of 5--6 lectures on advanced topics\r\nby distinguished outside visitors and U.C. faculty members, intended\r\nfor a graduate student to postdoctoral level audience.  We will\r\nwelcome and facilitate participation by young researchers from other\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nExciting recent mathematical developments lie at the intersection of\r\nrepresentation theory, geometry and combinatorics, with much more to\r\nbe done in the future.  The faculty members forming the core of the\r\nresearch group (Profs. Haiman, Reshetikhin, Borcherds, Frenkel,\r\nGivental, Knutson, Serganova and Wolf) have extensive overlapping\r\ninterests, each using techniques from all three areas in his or her\r\nown work.  Specific research interests common to multiple members of\r\nthe group include topics in quantum field theory; representation\r\ntheory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras; quantum groups and\r\ncanonical bases; Gromov-Witten invariants and mirror symmetry; and\r\ngeometry and combinatorics of Schubert varieties and flag manifolds.\r\nThe activities of the project are designed to foster research\r\ncollaboration and above all to equip young mathematicians in training\r\nwith the broad range of intellectual tools needed to reach the\r\nfrontiers of research on such topics such as those mentioned.\r\n",
