 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31) This project offers professional development opportunities for Information Technology instructors at the secondary and post-secondary levels in a rural setting by:\r\n1. Providing Information Technology two-week internships in regional businesses during the summer for secondary and post-secondary instructors.\r\n2. Allowing instructors to keep their curriculum current by accessing training available on-line or at industry-sponsored conferences and educational seminars.\r\nThis project expands the academic preparation of information technology teachers from the classroom to the \"real world\" of work. Interaction with business and industry will enable instructors to bring that \"world\" back into the classroom for more relevant and meaningful experiences for both high school and college students by integrating real world scenarios into the classroom. The business experience by instructors is the piece missing in the training of regional instructors. By integrating business and industry contacts with secondary and post-secondary education in the 11,000 square mile region, participants will learn how business and education can partner for the benefit of students in a rural, isolated area.\r\n",
