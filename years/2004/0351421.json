 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nOCE-0351421\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to measure chlorofluorocarbons (CFC-11,  CFC-12,  CFC-113)  on  the  U.K.  run  26 degrees N  transect  in  winter  2004.  The  objective  is  to  provide  a  high  quality  data  set,  and  make  them  available nearly immediately to the community as required by the Global Repeat program. The program is in  support  of  CLIVAR  (CLImate VARiability and predictability) and  the  International Carbon  Cycle   Programs,  and  is  a  component  of  a  global observing system for the physical climate/CO2 system. The data will contribute to documenting and understanding how ventilation and ocean carbon change over time. The intellectual merit of the  proposed  measurements  is  that  they  will  contribute  to  the  goals  of  the  Global  Repeat program:  data  for  model  calibration  and  validation,  carbon  system  studies,  calibration  of autonomous sensors, and deep and shallow water mass and ventilation studies. In addition, the addition of CFC measurements to the 2004 occupation of the 26N transect will  fill a zonal gap in a region where CFC inventories are relatively large, and in the west increasing rapidly throughout the water column. \r\n\r\nThe  broader  societal  impacts  of  the  proposed  measurements include: broad and near immediate dissemination of data to enhance scientific and technological understanding; societal benefits of collection of a high quality data set, use of the data to assess climate change, and a resource for model calibration of the climate system. Carbon dioxide is one of  the  most  important  gases  in  the  atmosphere  affecting  the  radiative  balance  of  the  earth.  A number  of  alternative,  although  still  indirect,  means  of  estimating  anthropogenic CO2 use CFC data.  The  funded  measurements  will  contribute  to  quantifying  the  inventory  and  flux  of anthropogenic CO2 in the oceans, and to understanding its variability.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
