 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 03-043, category NIRT. A multidisciplinary team of scientists and students from North Carolina A & T State (NCAT) University (an HBCU institution), North Carolina State University (NCSU), University of Florida (UF), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IITK) and IBM TJ Watson Center, participates in this project.  The proposed research is focused on the synthesis and characterization of self-assembled ordered structures of (i) nanomagnetic particles in nonmagnetic thin-film matrices and (ii) nanodimensional impurity defects in a high temperature superconducting thin film matrix. The principle of strain fields to create uniform arrays of islands is being used for the first time for self-organized coherent growth of transition metal, transition metal alloys, and complex-oxide nanoparticles having controlled shape, dimension, and separation in thin-film matrices.  The results from scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy will be used in establishing an unambiguous correlation between microstructure and physical properties. The final goal of this project is the fabrication of self-assembled nanoparticulate based devices with enhanced performance. The proposed educational and outreach activities include: development of nanomaterials based research and education programs for graduate, undergraduate, K-12 students and teachers, early recruitment of an underrepresented population of undergraduate students, providing motivation for more women and minority students to pursue advanced degrees, and generation of a diversified skilled workforce and informed public in nanoscience and nanotechnology issues. \r\n\r\nThis proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 03-043, category NIRT. The success of the project will lead to the creation of self-assembled magnetic particles in thin-film media with smaller particle size, tighter size distribution, optimized compositions, and specified particle orientation.  These capabilities are expected to lead to revolutionary progress in ultra-high density magnetic recording and spintronics.  Similarly, the proposed self-assembly process will provide improved pinning sites for vortices in superconducting thin films and will result in more efficient operation of transmission cables, microwave, and tunneling electronic devices at higher temperatures. With respect to long term benefits, the proposed NIRT activities will lead to (i) strengthening nanomaterials based research at NCAT, (ii) education, and training programs for undergraduates, graduates and post-doctoral fellows from underrepresented groups, (iii) new learning opportunities for K-12 students and teachers, and (iv) motivating more women and minority students to pursue advanced degrees. \r\n",
