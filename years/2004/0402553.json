 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-year project enhances science and technology teaching in grades 10-14 by providing Molecular Literacy content in support of careers in biotechnology and nanotechnology. The project develops new materials that use highly interactive molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics models, and embeds these models in learning activities that are appropriate for both core science courses and specialized courses teaching biotechnology and nanotechnology workplace competencies. Concord Consortium is partnering with Middlesex Community College, Bedford, Massachusetts, its feeder high schools, additional community colleges, biotechnology and nanotechnology companies. CORD, an educational non-profit in Texas, is providing national dissemination. Concord, working with Middlesex teachers, is developing assessments that indicate student attainment of these standards, and is preparing drafts of activities. Initial activities undergo formative evaluation at the collaborating institutions using the project-generated assessments. After a revision cycle, the final materials undergo summative evaluation in ten technical high school and community college classrooms nationwide. Both student learning and teacher use of the materials are evaluated. \r\n\r\nThe project utilizes sophisticated modeling tools based on accurate physical theories of atomic interactions. Collaborators identify those bio/nanotech standards appropriate for model-based activities. Model-based activities are developed both as individual explorations that can be easily inserted into instruction, and also grouped together into coherent thematic sequences of explorations. The activities link the models with related macroscopic representations and laboratory technologies. The project involves developing a quantum mechanics modeling engine simplified for education, adding functionality to an existing molecular dynamics engine, and adapting these resources to the learning of the science and to processes of biotechnology and nanotechnology \r\n\r\nUsing highly interactive models, students can experience the nano world, develop intuitions about what is normal, and learn how to predict, without the need for difficult theoretical formalism. At the conclusion of the project, partners make all software, activities, professional development materials, and reports freely available, and the Concord Consortium continues to host the activities.\r\n",
