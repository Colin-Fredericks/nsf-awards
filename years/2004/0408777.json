 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThe control of vibration in rotordynamic systems is an important problem in engineering.\r\nThese unwanted oscillations can lead to premature failure or poor performance of the system.\r\nTraditionally active vibration control of rotordynamic systems is accomplished by adding\r\nactuators (electromagnets or active magnetic bearings) that apply a radial force to the shaft\r\nof the rotor. These actuators are used in feedback control systems that are designed to\r\nameliorate the effects of the unwanted vibration.\r\nThis project develops an approach to the control of vibration in rotordynamic systems\r\nthat does not rely on external actuators. Here we consider rotordynamic systems that are\r\ndriven by electromagnetic motors. By modifying the commutation and control of these\r\nmotors they can be made to produce a torque and a radial force. This radial force can\r\nthen be controlled to suppress the vibrations in the system. To evaluate the torque/force\r\ngenerating capability of motors this project has set three broad objectives; (1) To develop\r\nand experimentally validate models, suitable for use in control system design, that accurately\r\npredict the behavior of motors that are used as torque and radial force generators. (2) To\r\ndemonstrate the practical feasibility of using motors as torque/force generators in actual\r\nrotordynamic systems. Specifically, a ywheel energy storage (FES) device and a a hard\r\ndisk drive (HDD) system. (3) To integrate these new techniques into the undergraduate\r\ncurriculum and provide research opportunities for women and underrepresented minority\r\nstudents.\r\nIntellectual Merits: The use of axial and radial ux permanent magnet motors to generate\r\nradial forces for vibration suppression is believed to be a novel approach. In addition, the\r\nactuator modeling and control techniques developed in this project can be applied to other\r\nAC/DC motor designs.\r\nPractical FES devices that use magnetic bearings require precise regulation of the air\r\ngap between the rotor and the stator. The controllers must provide stable operation over\r\na range of speeds while rejecting the harmful effects of disk imbalance and base excitation.\r\nThis project will design and implement a multiple model controller for a FES device that\r\nuses an axial ux motor for torque and radial force production.\r\nBroader Impacts: By eliminating the need for external force actuators this research will\r\nlead to FES devices with higher energy densities. This would make FES systems a practi-cal\r\nalternative to electrochemical energy storage systems. When used in conjunction with\r\nrenewable energy sources these improved FES devices can help reduce national dependence\r\non fossil fuels.\r\nThis research can also provide a low-cost means for suppressing vibration in HDD sys-tems,\r\nthus improving the data storage capabilities of these devices. It is estimated that the\r\nUnited States digitally stored more than 400 billion documents in 1997, with 72 billion new\r\ndocuments being added each year. Thus, it is important to conduct research that will lead\r\nto increased reliability of HDD devices.\r\nThe education initiatives of the proposed project will focus on bringing modern techno-logical\r\ndevelopments in bearing design and motor control into the undergraduate classroom.\r\nAlso, in collaboration with the UW/NSF LSAMP program the the project will focus on\r\noutreach activities by providing opportunities for underrepresented minorities and women\r\nto work in an engineering setting.",
