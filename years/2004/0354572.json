 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to investigate several critical issues concerning the equation of state (EOS) of dense neutron-rich matter relevant to the reactions expected with the high energy radioactive beams at the planned Rare Isotope Accelerator (RIA). The ultimate goal is to determine accurately the isospin dependence of the nuclear EOS. The latter is among the most important topics identified in the latest long-range plan for U.S. nuclear physics. It is also a foundamental property that governs many aspects of neutron stars and the explosion mechanisms of supernove. Among the important theoretical issues to be addressed in the proposed work are: \r\nMomentum-dependence of the symmetry potential and its effects on nuclear \r\nreactions induced by neutron-rich nuclei at RIA; \r\nEffective masses of neutrons and protons and their scattering cross sections in dense neutron-rich matter; \r\nIncompressibility of dense neutron-rich matter; \r\nIsospin-separation and chemical instabilities of neutron-rich matter; \r\nCharge-symmetry-breaking (CSB) and rho-omega meson mixing in dense neutron- \r\nrich matter. \r\nIn addition, it is also proposed to develop a transport theory with Bose-Einstein statistics for relativistic heavy-ion collisions. \r\nSeveral undergraduate students will fully participate directly in the proposed research. Their involvement in research provides a broad and solid basis for their choice of where to take their career beyond the undergraduate degree. The funding of this proposal will thus allow the PI to better prepare students in a research non-intensive institution to become next generation scientists and engineers. Funding of this proposal will also further improve the environment and infrastructure for research in nuclear physics at Arkansas State University in particular and the State of Arkansas in general.",
