 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Scheidt is developing new methods for the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds utilizing catalytic, multi-component reactions in which a transition metal complex initiates a cascade involving a metallocarbenoid and Lewis base-containing molecules. The reactive intermediate generated will be trapped by a subsequent cycloaddition reaction. Use of chiral ligand-transition metal complexes as catalysts will allow enantiocontrolled heterocyclic synthesis, while intramolecular variants will permit the rapid construction of complex polycyclic products. Professor Scheidt will develop new broad-platform molecular visualization capabilities designed to enhance classroom and Web-based learning, and he will facilitate the transfer of this technology to the high school arena through establishment of a high school teacher outreach program.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the teaching and research efforts of Professor Karl A. Scheidt, of the Department of Chemistry at Northwestern University. Professor Scheidt is developing novel methods for the rapid construction of complex organic structures, exploiting the unusual reactivity and versatility of metal complexes. His methods hold promise for general utility in the synthesis of the complex molecular structures often displaying important chemical or biological properties. In order to facilitate student learning about the often confusing three-dimensional structures of organic molecules, Professor Scheidt is developing versatile and accessible methods for visualization of molecular structures. He is introducing these techniques throughout the organic chemistry curriculum and is facilitating their usage in the high school setting through establishment of a high school teacher outreach program.",
