 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an instrument acquisition proposal from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program to the University of Oklahoma Norman Campus.  The University of Oklahoma Norman Campus will acquire a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer for research and education on spintronics and semiconductor nanostructure. Spintronics and nanoscience are two prevailing themes in materials research today. Far infrared spectroscopy is potentially useful in both areas, since relevant energy levels for materials design are typically in the far infrared. The main experimental challenges in both areas are due to low signal strength. The new instrument will allow researchers to overcome these challenges with a vacuum-pumped, Fourier Transform Infrared spectrometer. Vacuum pumping will remove the far infrared water vapor absorption lines that obscure data obtained by flushed spectrometers. It will open a spectral window that has broad utility in the fields of spintronics and semiconductor nanostructures. Students will use the spectrometer for summer projects, undergraduate senior projects, and graduate theses. The proposed project will provide an excellent opportunity for student training on an instrument that is used widely in many scientific fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an instrument acquisition proposal from the Instrumentation for Materials Research Program to the University of Oklahoma Norman Campus.
