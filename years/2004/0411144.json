The project is adapting existing Lego materials to develop and teach a course presenting cross-disciplinary engineering concepts and practices.  Modules are being developed for six engineering disciplines, and student teams are using the LEGO Mindstorms product to learn and practice the engineering design process. Efforts are underway to establish the course as an approved General Education course and also get it included in the Teacher Education Program. The evaluation effort, involving both formative and summative assessment, is being conducted by a separate research and evaluation center at the PI's institution.  Student surveys and logs, special rubrics, and classroom observations are being used to evaluate changes in the students' knowledge and attitudes.  Dissemination plans include journal and conference papers, a website, and a CD.  The PIs also are planning a workshop for faculty members at other institutions and have commitments for involvement from four national leaders in the use of the LEGO materials in teaching engineering concepts.\r\n",
