 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to produce a complete, closed and finished genome sequence of the sometimes-pathogenic Bacillus pumilus strain FO-036b. This strain produces spores and vegetative cells with dramatically elevated resistance to a variety of sterilizing agents, including vapor phase hydrogen peroxide, UV radiation, gamma radiation and desiccation. Such spore forming bacteria challenge proper maintenance of environments in medical, pharmaceutical, semiconductor manufacturing, spacecraft assembly, and food processing environments. The project will be performed at the Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center. The strategy will be to perform whole genome shotgun sequencing of clones with different sized inserts. Assembly, finishing, and annotation will use the existing procedures at the BCM-HGSC. Final assembly will be verified by fingerprinting of clones that form a contiguous tiling path on the genome. Sequence and assembly information will be made public via a website at the BCM-HGSC without delay. This project will facilitate basic research on the genetic basis for resistance to UV radiation and vapor phase hydrogen peroxide as well as understanding how organisms adapt to highly oxidizing environments. The project will be of interest to research communities including those interested in sporulation and DNA repair, NASA communities concerned with planetary protection and adaptation of life to high UV flux or oxidizing environments, industrial communities that require maintenance of clean environments and the biodefense community concerns about highly resistant pathogenic agents. \r\n\r\n",
