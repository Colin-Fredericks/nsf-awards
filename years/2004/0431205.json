 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless sensor networks have a large array of potential applications,\r\nincluding environmental monitoring, home and factory automation, and\r\nhomeland security.  This research addresses efficient data collection\r\nfrom sensor networks, which is one of the fundamental bottlenecks to\r\nlarge-scale deployment of low-cost sensor nodes.  Two key difficulties\r\nare scale (how to manage very large numbers of relatively\r\nunsophisticated nodes) and energy (communication is energy-intensive,\r\nbut sensor nodes must operate for months or years on battery, or by\r\nscavenging energy from the environment). This research has two\r\ncomplementary research thrusts, both investigating novel techniques\r\nfor data collection from sensor networks, exploiting the natural\r\ndistribution of sensor nodes in space.  The first, termed virtual\r\nradar, enables deployment of extremely simple sensor nodes which do\r\nnot need networking or position location functionality, by moving the\r\ncomplexity to a sophisticated data collection node.  The second\r\napproach requires more sophisticated nodes, and increases energy\r\nefficiency and range by obtaining the functionality of multi-antenna\r\ntransmission by intelligent coordination between neighboring\r\n(single-antenna) sensor nodes.\r\n\r\nIn the first thrust, termed virtual radar, sensor nodes with activity\r\nto report electronically reflect a beacon transmitted by a\r\n\"driveby\" or \"flyby\" collector node, thus\r\ncreating a radar-like geometry.  The collector employs sophisticated\r\nsynthetic aperture radar like signal processing techniques to obtain\r\nan \"image\" of the activity in the sensor field.\r\nTracking of events moving across the sensor field, and exploiting\r\nmultiple antennas at the collector, are investigated.  The second\r\nthrust, termed distributed transmission, involves investigation of\r\nbeamforming, diversity and power gains obtained by coordinating\r\nbetween neighboring nodes, as a function of the level of\r\nsynchronization achieved among the nodes.  Methods of achieving such\r\nsynchronization are also considered.\r\n",
