These asymptotic problems arise\r\nwhen a dimensionless parameter (such as the Reynolds number, the\r\nMach number or  a  time scaling) goes to zero or to infinity. In\r\nstudying these problems, many mathematical difficulties  arise.\r\nThese difficulties are mainly   due to the change of the type of\r\nthe equations, the presence of many temporal and spatial scales,\r\nthe presence of resonances,   the presence of boundary layers ...\r\nMany tools have been developed to circumvent these difficulties\r\nsuch as the introduction of different types of measures to\r\ndescribe the defect of strong convergence,\r\n the use of compensated compactness type\r\n arguments, the use of averaging lemma,    the use of\r\nenergy methods and  relative entropy methods ... Of course, many\r\nother tools should be developed in the future.  More specifically\r\nthe  PI  plans to continue working on the hydrodynamic limits of\r\nthe Boltzmann equation when the Knudsen number goes to 0\r\nespecially in bounded domains and relate this to some of the known\r\nresults in the compressible-incompressible limit. He also plans to\r\nlook at the limit when the Weber number goes to infinity in the\r\nwater wave problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes to study some asymptotic problems  coming from\r\nFluid Mechanics, Gas Dynamics and Quantum Mechanics. The study of\r\nthese  asymptotic problems is very important to get  a better\r\nunderstanding about  the behavior of complicated  systems in\r\ndifferent limiting cases. This also  allows to have a better\r\nunderstanding of the real physical phenomenon taking place.\r\nMoreover, it provides a way of giving  rigorous derivations of\r\ndifferent physical models. It also gives  a better knowledge about\r\nthe domain of validity of each simplifying model. This is very\r\nimportant for engineers and physicists who are looking for the\r\nsimplest model that captures the phenomenon to implement\r\nnumerically or  to apply in real life.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
