 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides an opportunity for the sharing of best practices and identification of science education research questions focused on the theme of Teacher Research Experiences (TRE).  Participants would include TRE PIs, teachers from TRE projects, scientists who mentored teachers in their research experiences, TRE project evaluators and project directors and other professional educators.  All have an interest in understanding these projects and how transfer to the classroom of content, skills and best instructional practices can be achieved.  Identification of educational research questions to guide future professional development activites of this nature and help inform how to measure their effectiveness will be of interest to science education researchers.  The results of any such studies may have very broad impact due to the ubiquitous nature of TRE professional development projects supported by many diverse agencies.  The format would be a three-day symposium at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography hosted by the PI and Co-PI of Project ARMADA, an NSF/ESIE TRE project at that university.",
