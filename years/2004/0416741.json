 "awd_abstract_narration": "Award Abstract\r\n\r\nLight-dependent chloroplast movements have been observed in all green plants including alga, moss, ferns, and angiosperms.  These chloroplast movements appear to serve as a rapid mechanism to fine-tune photosynthetic productivity as light intensity varies in the environment.  Specifically, movement of chloroplasts to the upper and lower surfaces of cells of a leaf in dim light may improve light capture, whereas chloroplast movement to the sides of cells when the light intensity is high may protect them from photodamage.  The experiments outlined in this proposal incorporate a combination of genetic, molecular and physiological approaches to understand the mechanism of chloroplast movements.  The proposed work will focus on the function of two novel genes that were recently identified as essential for chloroplast movements to occur.  The research is expected to elucidate the motility mechanism(s) responsible for the movement and provide new insight into the nature of the signal transduction pathway involved. Understanding how light-induced chloroplast movements are controlled at the molecular level will contribute to understanding how photosynthetic potential and plant productivity may be maximized.  The project will also provide training to a postdoctoral fellow, a graduate student and opportunities for undergraduate students to gain hands-on research experiences.\r\n",
