 "awd_abstract_narration": "Using experiments and materials from an existing web-based laboratory and a collection of donated experiments and hard-to-produce stimulus materials (e.g., sound files, graphics, and movies), this project is assembling a digital library that consists of (1) highly interactive, web-deliverable psychology experiments and demonstrations, (2) a cumulative data archive from which students can retrieve datasets for analysis, and (3) user-controlled data extraction and analysis tools designed for the diverse needs of end users. The project is led by the American Psychological Association (APA) and also involves the University of Mississippi and Northern Iowa University. An advisory board is providing site management to assure the quality, coherence, and pedagogical value of all library materials, as well as the comprehensiveness of the collection.\r\n\r\nOnce constructed, the Online Psychology Library (OPL) will be an active learning resource open to every student with access to an Internet-connected computer. The Library's experiment delivery, data downloads, and one-click analysis tools will permit the easy integration of teaching and research at institutions that do not currently offer support for student research and even by teachers who are not adept in experimental design and data analysis. Psychology students will be able to collect data, analyze data, and report their findings for class assignments or individual projects. Further, because psychology is allied to many disciplines--biology, sociology, and political science among them--OPL will contribute to the set of experiments available to students who wish to study psychologically-based issues in related scientific disciplines.\r\n",
