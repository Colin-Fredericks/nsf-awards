 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fields of macromolecular, dendrimer, polymer, supramolecular chemistry, and\r\nnanotechnology, are expanding rapidly as they intersect and integrate. The research proposed\r\nherein, describes new material construction and analysis. Benefits to the public will arise through\r\nthe reporting of basic scientific results, applied technology, student training, and outreach\r\nprograms in this cutting edge field.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed activity explores novel and innovative routes to new\r\napplication-oriented materials predicated on logical extensions of foundations in prior results of\r\nthe principal investigator. Terpyridine-based dendritic networks, fractal nanoarchitectural selfassembly,\r\nand shape-persistent nanoscale constructs introduce new avenues and concepts for\r\nmacromolecular construction and utility. Fractal nanomolecular design and syntheses further\r\nintegrates the spatial arts and mathematics by incorporating self-similar motifs at different\r\nmolecular scales. Melding of supramolecular macromolecular chemistry with that of classical\r\norganic and inorganic regimes will lead to new thought processes,\" available methodologies, and\r\nbuilding blocks for material and device engineering.\r\nSpecifically, we herein propose to expand our investigations of branched architectures via\r\ndendritic construction based on (1) \"dendrimer-to-dendron\"  connectivity, since we have\r\ndeveloped terpyridine-metal-terpyridine assembly of preconstructed dendrimers and dendritic\r\ncomponents resulting in novel network-based architectures. Additionally, we intend to (2) extend\r\nour studies on fractal architectures for the construction of nanoscopic, precisely positioned,\r\nmultiple metal arrays; and (3) investigate the potential and effects of incorporation of shapepersistent,\r\nterpyridine-based ligands in the construction of polymetallic, hyperbranched\r\narchitectures.\r\nBroader Aspects: Advancement of discovery and understanding of the proposed work\r\nwill promote the integration of student training and enrichment, at all education levels, including\r\nK-12, undergraduate, graduate, post-doctoral and visiting scientists (national and international),\r\nby providing appropriately staged conceptual and technical scientific challenges. This will\r\nfacilitate student competence while instilling and nurturing specific elements of critical thinking,\r\nrequisite for all disciplines. Participation of underrepresented groups and minorities is encouraged\r\nthrough direct support (from additional funding sources) and community outreach projects\r\n(primarily through the College of Polymer Science and Polymer Engineering) and include innercity\r\nschool presentations and K-12 teacher involvement that broadly promote scientific and\r\ntechnical understanding. Additionally, scientific information about polymeric materials, and\r\ndendrimers in particular, is promulgated through the principal investigator's website\r\n(www.dendrimers.com ) which currently averages 6,000 - 7,000 visits per month.\r\nThe Akron-Cleveland metroplex has approximately 3 million residents (a 500 mile\r\nradius encompasses 42 % of the US population and 40 % of the Canadian population). This\r\nprovides a broadly diverse workforce (with unique polymer-related opportunities for regional\r\ninteractions) with close to 2000 polymer companies within 100 miles. The proposed activities\r\nwill enhance the N.E. Ohio workforce through research, training, presentations, and education,\r\nthus augmenting the mission of the University of Akron and the U.S. scientific agenda in the\r\ncommunity and region.\r\nCommercialization of discoveries and technologies arising from the proposed work will\r\nbe facilitated by the University of Akron Research Foundation and Office of Technology\r\nTransfer, in association with the Akron Commercialization Center and the newly-formed\r\nMaterials Experiment Station, (all under the auspices of the University of Akron) that is\r\ncommitted to aggressive marketing of University research.",
