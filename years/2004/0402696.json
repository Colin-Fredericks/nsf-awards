 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project addresses the need for expanded and more robust education for Building Science and Engineering Technicians within industry specializations including Controls Technicians, HVAC Technicians, Building Operators, Building Commissioning Technicians, and Refrigeration Technicians. Reflecting input from over 40 professionals convened to inform the investigators, this project utilizes the skills and capabilities of Laney College faculty, research scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a consultant with experience designing computer-based education simulations, and expert practitioners in the field. This team is collaborating to: \r\n\r\n- Revise and upgrade existing core curriculum at Laney College to include advanced technical and specialized academic courses, with key emphasis on hands-on learning.\r\n- Develop new program strands and corresponding certificates and degrees;\r\n- Assemble and install (in the Laney Lab) an HVAC system replicating a real-world commercial building configuration that can be used as an exemplar for other colleges;\r\n- Create a building operators \"flight simulator\" and other cost-effective and easily replicable instructional innovations to help develop systems-level understanding;\r\n- Pilot an educational strategy to transform the technician from one able to solve primarily component-level problems to one capable of solving complex system problems, able to use scientific principles, data and analytical techniques to solve problems, and able to maneuver through tradeoffs among design intent, occupant comfort, air quality, and energy efficiency, and able to assess performance data and make recommendations.\r\n",
