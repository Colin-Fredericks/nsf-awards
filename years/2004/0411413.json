 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop advanced numerical methods\r\nfor modeling flow and transport processes in coupled surface\r\nwater/ground water systems.  As the relevant processes, and spatial\r\nand temporal scales, can strongly differ in the various subdomains of\r\na coupled hydrosystem, different modeling concepts must be chosen for\r\nthese subdomains. The PIs will investigate appropriate mechanisms for\r\ncoupling mass, momentum and species transport in ground water and surface\r\nwater regions.  This will include mathematical formulation and\r\nalgorithmic and software tool development between different domains\r\nand models.  Efficient discretization techniques, based on finite\r\nelement technology developed by the PIs and adapted to the dominant\r\nprocesses in each region, will be developed.  The stability of\r\nthese methods will be analyzed, and a priori and a posteriori error\r\nestimates will be derived.  Time-stepping strategies for accurately\r\nhandling the different temporal scales within these flow and transport\r\ndomains will be studied, and fast and robust solution methods for the\r\nresulting linear and nonlinear systems of equations will be developed.\r\nRepresentative benchmark problems based on laboratory and field\r\nexperiments will be formulated and will be used to validate the\r\nnumerical methods.  The resulting methodology will be implemented\r\nwithin a parallel computing framework for distributed and grid\r\ncomputing platforms.\r\n\r\nSustainable management and protection of water resources is one of the\r\nkey problems of the 21st century.  Comprehensive, long-range water\r\nresource management requires a careful study of the interaction of\r\nground water and surface water.  Historically, ground water aquifers\r\nand surface water bodies, such as streams, lakes and wetlands, have\r\nbeen studied in isolation, without properly accounting for the\r\ninteractions between them.  Recent data, however, collected in the\r\nUnited States and abroad, give startling evidence of the effect\r\nsurface water and ground water systems have on each other.  These\r\nstudies indicate, for example, that water contamination can easily be\r\ntransmitted from ground to surface water and vice versa.  In many\r\ncases, the precise location of initial contamination is irrelevant,\r\nbecause the close proximity of ground and surface water can result in\r\nboth being contaminated.  Advanced computer simulators are needed to\r\nstudy and predict the movement of potentially harmful chemical species\r\nwithin these complex environments.  In this project, the PIs will\r\ndevelop mathematical models and state-of-the-art computational\r\nalgorithms and technologies for simulating large-scale ground and\r\nsurface water systems.  The project will involve the collaboration of\r\nthe PIs with researchers at government laboratories and state\r\nagencies, and will include the training of graduate and undergraduate\r\nstudents.  The technology to be developed has potential application to\r\nother areas, including thermal and chemical processing, biomedicine,\r\nand sequestration of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\r\n",
