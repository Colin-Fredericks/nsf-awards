 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maize is the most important American crop today. Therefore, a thorough knowledge of the function of maize genes is highly desirable. That knowledge can be gained from maize functional genomics projects that use transposons to disrupt gene function. In the present maize functional genomics project, a genetic resource is being developed that will enable investigators to combine the power of the mutational approach to define gene function with that of DNA sequencing to define a gene's make-up. The resource consists of a comprehensive set of lines based on transposons of the Ac/Ds family, which because of their transposition pattern, will be useful to scientists interested in saturating specific regions of the maize genome with transposon insertions. A set of 370 randomly generated transgenic lines with active transposon 'launch pads' will be identified, from which we expect to identify 124 transgenic lines that are equally spaced across the genome. In this set most genes in the maize genome will be within 7 cM of a launcing platform and, therefore realistic targets in localized transposon mutagenesis experiments. The transposons have been engineered to greatly facilitate the isolation of DNA sequences adjacent to transposed elements. The simple genetic scheme to select for transpositions and the ease in isolation of the adjacent sequences should make this resource particularly user-friendly. The lines will be made freely available to the research community through the Maize Genetics Stock Center in Urbana, IL. They will be deposited approximately once a year. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe ability for researchers to do mutagenesis across the maize genome will enable gene discovery and empower the corn research community.",
