The Board's objective is to improve the scientific and technological basis for resolving important national questions and issues associated with the efficient management and use of ground and surface water resources.\r\nIn carrying out its responsibilities and in serving the national interest, the Board\r\nresponds to requests for evaluations and advice through its ad hoc studies concerning specific and generic issues in water resources, influences action by initiating studies of issues that merit consideration by public agencies and others, identifies issues and topics of research related to water resources, and cooperates with other units of the National Research Council and groups with mutual interests outside of the National Research Council.\r\n",
