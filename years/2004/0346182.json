 "awd_abstract_narration": "An EarthScope workshop in the northern Rocky Mountains (NRM) will provide an opportunity\r\nfor a diverse array of earth scientists to meet and discuss the opportunities that\r\nEarthScope will provide to improve our understanding of the wide range of processes that\r\nformed this segment of continental crust. The NRM (generally defined as northern Wyoming,\r\nSW Montana, and eastern Idaho) is a unique environment that provides an excellent natural\r\nlaboratory for studying many critical phenomena associated with the evolution of the\r\ncontinental crust-mantle system. We propose to hold a 2.5-day workshop in the early fall of 2005 in SW Montana. The meeting will begin with a general session to inform participants of the current status of EarthScope and provide overviews of the overarching scientific questions related to the\r\ngeology of the NRM. An organizing committee will be charged to set the meeting agenda and\r\nparticipate in selection of speakers and participants. The workshop will provide the\r\nopportunity for smaller working groups to meet and identify scientific objectives and\r\nassess how EarthScope can help address these objectives. Possible working group topics and\r\nlists of individuals who have expressed an interest in attending is provided. A concluding\r\nsession will focus on presentations from the individual working groups. Appropriate and timely announcements will allow ample opportunity for all interested parties to apply to attend. \r\nThe broader impacts of the workshop will be realized through comprehensive web development\r\nthat will support workshop logistics, pre- and post-workshop activities, posting of all\r\nworkshop products (e.g. talks, posters, discussion summaries, essays, plans), and will\r\nbegin to compile a region-wide digital resource collection. The workshop program will also\r\naddress the EarthScope Education and Outreach (E&O) objectives by establishing an E&O\r\nworking group in parallel with the research-oriented working groups. The workshop will\r\nalso serve to identify and recruit colleagues who are interested in contributing to\r\nEarthScope E&O in the NRM.",
