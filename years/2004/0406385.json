 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis award is to support the attendance of students, post-doctoral fellows and young faculty at a workshop entitled \"Protein Phosphorylation Workshop\" to be held December 11-14 at the Asilomar Conference center. This workshop is intended to bring together a highly diverse group of laboratory and computational scientists to consider how to develop interdisciplinary approaches to understanding the structure and function of protein kinases and how to integrate these approaches with the development of advanced computational infrastructure to support experimental work in the area. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this meeting is to address key questions about how databases and computational resources can support experimental research. Clearly, databases and computational resources are key elements of our research infrastructure, but few would say that current resources meet the needs of current laboratory research. How these resources can be enhanced to deal with the increasingly large datasets and biological systems models that will be developed in the next few years is an open question that urgently needs to be addressed. This meeting brings together researchers from many experimental and computational domains. It will act as a seed both for new developments in computational infrastructure, as well as for new interactions and collaborations needed for integrative research on the structure and function of protein kinases. \r\n\r\n",
