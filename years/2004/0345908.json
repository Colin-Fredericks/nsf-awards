The instrument will be housed in the Department of Geological Sciences, and it will be included in a group of interdepartmental, shared facilities at the University known as the Center for Advanced Materials Characterization in Oregon (CAMCOR).  The capabilities of a new electron microprobe will enhance a broad base of innovative research at the University of Oregon, and its integration into CAMCOR will allow the PIs and other scientists to expand their research into creative interdisciplinary areas.  The new microprobe will be used primarily for research in Geology, Chemistry, Materials Research and Archaeology that includes igneous petrology, volcanology, ore deposits, paleosols and paleoclimate, chemical kinetics, thin film structures, semiconductors, and the provenance of prehistoric artifacts. The improved capabilities of this instrument will enable a number of technical advances for these research programs. The new electron microprobe facility will also play a critical role in research training and education at the undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral levels in Geology and related sciences at the University of Oregon. It will be particularly used by volcanology and petrology graduate students in Geology and by Masters internship program students in Materials Science who are pursing careers in semiconductor processing.  As with other CAMCOR facilities, the new instrument will be available for use by researchers at other educational institutions throughout the Pacific Northwest. To maintain the CAMCOR facilities, the University of Oregon has committed significant funds to provide long-term technical support for all CAMCOR instruments.  \r\n\r\n***\r\n",
