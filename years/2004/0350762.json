 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports Professor Aaron Odom of Michigan State University for his research exploring the development and elaboration of pyrrolyl-based ligands in early transition metal-based catalysis.  Prof. Odom will investigate the formation of C-N bond forming reactions, especially in the synthesis of heterocycles, through the investigation of new titanium-based catalysts.  The development of hydroamination catalysts will be furthered by the elucidation of the structural features and electronic structures of key intermediates to understand the factors governing metal-ligand multiple band reactivity.  This research will advance the chemistry needed for the organic transformations of heterocyclic frameworks such as pyrroles, indoles and quinolines that are important in the development of the majority of fine chemicals including pharmaceuticals.\r\n\r\nThe development of new reaction chemistry and catalysts for C-N bond formation is a critical step to improve the methodology for the synthesis of a variety of compounds such as pyrroles, indoles and quinolines, many of which are important specialty and pharmaceutical compounds   This research will allow the generation of organic compounds with relatively high molecular complexity from simple starting materials.  Graduate students, undergraduate students and postdoctoral associates will receive excellent training in synthetic methodology, and the electronic structure studies of metal complexes in a forefront inorganic chemistry program.",
