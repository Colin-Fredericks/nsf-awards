 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merits: \r\n\r\nAdvances in Nanotechnologies have enabled researchers to explore many new material systems and device structures in nanoscale and in reduced dimensions. Lithography for micro- and nanofabrication is of utmost importance for exploiting such structures as well as their new applications. In this GOALI program we will develop new materials and patterning techniques related to imprinting-based nanolithography. We will investigate a number of important scientific issues involved in this new technology that have not been adequately addressed, to develop new materials and methodologies to further expand the scope of its applicability to different types of substrates and applications, and to develop simplified processes that will make this technology accessible to wide range of researchers in different disciplines. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\n\r\nThis GOALI program will provide students with valuable experience from industrial collaboration and from participation in interdisciplinary researches. The project will also provide research opportunities for undergraduates, woman, and summer high school students. New development from this program will be disseminated in a timely manner through scientific conferences and journal publications, and will be incorporated into a graduate course on micro- and nanotechnology. By providing a truly simple, low-cost and high-throughput nanolithography technique to the scientific community, it will not only help to rapidly proliferate the knowledge on these new development, but also through the interaction with researchers from other fields we will be able to identify many new important applications that can be enabled by these technologies.\r\n\r\n",
