 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research to develop at Drexel University the capability of etching of high aspect ratio micro- and nanostructures in various polymers, silicon, and glass by acquiring an Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) etcher system. The development of such capabilities will benefit several nanotechnology projects at Drexel University and at the University of Pennsylvania. These projects include 3 NSF sponsored NIRTs on programmable assembly of nanocomponents and on carbon nanotube based nanofluidics.  It will also benefit research on novel liquid crystal devices and soft condensed matter. It will be highly instrumental in NSF sponsored research on effects of surface morphology on cellular adhesion.\r\n\r\nThe addition of the proposed ICP etching capability at Drexel will have a broad impact. No similar tool is available in the Philadelphia region and the proposed ICP system will be available to academic institutions and corporations in the entire Philadelphia region and beyond.  Drexel University and the University of Pennsylvania are within one city block from each other and effectively form one contiguous university campus. The proposed ICP system will be part of a network of equipment for nanotechnology research and education being established within the two universities/one campus framework. It will directly benefit the NSF IGERT project to establish nanotechnology education within this framework. Drexel University and Penn are located in an urban school district and reaches many underprivileged students through effective outreach programs. Advanced instrumentation such as the proposed ICP system helps increase exposure of traditionally underrepresented groups to exciting advanced technologies. \r\n\r\n",
