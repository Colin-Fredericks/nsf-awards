 "awd_abstract_narration": "The performance of Spin-electronic devices critically depends on the electronic, magnetic and structural properties at the interfaces. Successful fabrication of such devices requires the application of versatile deposition techniques capable to closely control nucleation and growth phenomena. A deposition technique with excellent control of the deposition parameters is Electrochemical deposition (ECD). Compared to other thin film preparation methods (sputtering, MBE), ECD has several intriguing advantages.\r\nIn our previous work funded by NSF (ECS 0070236 - Fabrication and analysis of magneto-electronic devices by electrochemical techniques) we have demonstrated (i) the ability of ECD to grow epitaxial Ni or Fe on GaAs; (ii) the capability of electrodeposition technique to synthesize sharp interfaces with little or no interdiffusion at the interfaces; (iii) that electrochemical methods can be implemented for the selective growth of metals on semiconductors. These methods are potentially capable to provide nm-scale resolution.\r\nIn the proposed renewal of this research project, we plan to leverage the knowledge acquired on the fabrication of metal/semiconductor structure to the fabrication of novel structures which will provide prospective components for feasible magnetoelectronic devices. In summary, we propose to:\r\n(i) \tExtend the set of semiconductor substrates utilized to AlGaAs, Ge and InAs;\r\n(ii) \tDevelop methods for the protection of very thin magnetic layer, providing for stable structures against environmental degradation;\r\n(iii) Undertake exploratory work towards the growth of semiconductor on top of ferromagnetic materials.\r\nAdvances in these three research activities will put us in the position to:\r\n(i) \tStudy spin injection processes across FM/SC interfaces;\r\n(ii) Fabricate nanowires and nanocontacts for study of ballistic magnetoresistance and fundamental transport studies.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT\r\nBeyond the pure research component, this project will provide the involved graduate student with expanded training in her/his soft skills through frequent presentations in special seminars and extended group meetings.\r\n",
