 "awd_abstract_narration": "\tHenry Ford Community College (HFCC), along with its partners the University of Michigan-Dearborn (UMD) and Eastern Michigan University (EMU), are piloting and evaluating the introduction of a writing component into science and mathematics courses for pre-service teachers.  In the first stage of the project, writing instructors work with mathematics and science faculty members to develop writing activities that encourage students to formulate in writing what they are learning about mathematics and science. As a result of these faculty professional development activities, science and mathematics faculty become adept at formulating and assessing writing assignments, defining learning outcomes, and encouraging student reflection.  In the second stage of the project, faculty members implement a number of writing activities in their classes.  Formative evaluation includes meetings among the science and mathematics faculty and the writing instructor to critique classroom practice and results and make necessary revisions. Further evaluation includes examination of faculty- and student-generated portfolios, as well as exit interviews of both students and faculty. \r\n \r\n",
