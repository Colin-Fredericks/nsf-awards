 "awd_abstract_narration": "All nations share a concern about how to best prepare the next generation of leaders who will be \r\nable to confront a complex set of social, political, technical, and health issues within a global \r\nsetting.  There are many issues associated with globalization and doctoral education such as the \r\nways in which technology enables a new level of international research and policy networks, the \r\nrenewed interest in and commitment to understanding the changing labor market for highly \r\neducated professionals, and the production of PhD recipients as they represent the leading labor \r\nforce for knowledge-based economies. Taken together these issues create a powerful motivation \r\nto share information about how to educate these new leaders. \r\n \r\nTo facilitate the understanding of forces and forms that shape doctoral education worldwide and \r\ninterpret the emerging trends, the Center for Innovation and Research in Graduate Education \r\nproposes to bring together no more than thirty key players (policy makers, graduate education \r\nresearchers, university administrators, industry representatives, and funders) from around the \r\nworld in a three-day conference. Issues to be discussed include, needs of a highly educated labor \r\nforced for the 21st century, and the characteristics of this labor force, the impact of technology on \r\nresearch and education, the content and the pedagogy of doctoral education, the transition from \r\ndoctoral education or postdoctoral appointment to stable employment, the changing \r\ndemographics of the doctoral student body (i.e., gender, socio-economic class, race, and \r\nethnicity), and financing graduate education, including the privatization of education throughout \r\nthe world. Differences and commonalities among nations will be explicitly mapped out. \r\n \r\nWe will commission a paper from each participating country describing the current state of \r\ndoctoral education according to a common set of issues. The initial goal of these papers will be to \r\ncreate a common language and understanding of each country.s system of doctoral education. On \r\nthis basis potential shared forces that drive doctoral education can be identified and categorized. \r\nAnd, the group will work together to investigate if the various reforms in doctoral education are \r\nconverging toward a similar model as a result of global forces. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: This series of conferences will have a number of important impacts. First, it \r\nwill move a broad coalition of scholars, policy makers, funders, and administrators toward a \r\nbetter grasp of the issues of doctoral education across nations. Second, it will share among \r\nparticipants information on innovations and best practices currently shaping doctoral programs. \r\nThird, it will work toward establishing greater inclusiveness within in the realm of doctoral \r\neducation of underrepresented groups. Fourth, it will work to develop of a comprehensive \r\nresearch agenda on doctoral education internationally. And, fourth, it will examine ways in which \r\nissues can be addressed in policy to foster the education and training of leadership for a \r\nknowledge-based society in a global economy. \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merits: The intellectual merits of this series of conferences will include (1) \r\nfurthering the research and training opportunities and international collaboration in doctoral \r\neducation; (2) establishing an ongoing formal network of key players in doctoral education so that \r\nforces  (political, economic, technological) can be responded to in a manner most conducive to \r\nfurthering the high quality and inclusiveness of doctoral education worldwide; and (3) providing \r\na comprehensive foundation for setting research agendas in doctoral education through systematic \r\nknowledge exchange.",
