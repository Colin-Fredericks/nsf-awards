 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research at the State University of New York at Stony Brook aims to provide new understanding of the underlying causes for the symmetry breaking in the fundamental interactions of nature. The electromagnetic and weak interactions, though unified in phenomena at high energies and in the first moments after the Big Bang, appear at lower energies to be quite distinct. The Standard Model of fundamental interactions and constituents of matter builds in this symmetry breaking through the Higgs boson. One strand of the proposed research is the search for the Higgs boson. Another strand of the proposed studies seeks evidence for phenomena that will show how the Standard Model is modified, and help illuminate the more comprehensive theory. These aspects of symmetry breaking will be explored through work in the D0 (at Fermilab) and ATLAS (at CERN) experiments. The proposal also outlines a new participation in the KOPIO experiment at Brookhaven National Laboratory, aimed at the measurement of a rare neutral kaon decay (to a neutral pion, neutrino and anti-neutrino). This would not occur unless there were a lack of symmetry between our world and one in which particles are replaced by antiparticles and viewed in a mirror (CP symmetry). The observation of a deviation from the value predicted by the Standard Model will signal that new non-standard mechanisms are at play in CP-violation, and should aid in understanding the origin of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the universe. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the research will occur at several levels: (a) Understanding how matter is constructed and how the forces of nature shape it into the myriad observed forms is a long standing question that resonates with scientists and non-scientists alike; (b) The research program poses a set of questions through which students and postdoctoral fellows will learn not only to frame crisp tests of the fundamental construction of matter, but also to devise innovative methods and tools for conducting them. Attacking such problems provides the rigorously educated young people that our society desperately needs; and (c) the proposal includes elements of outreach to the broader community.\r\n",

Our research centered on the continuing program with the D&Oslash; experiment at the Fermilab proton antiproton collider, then the highest energy accelerator complex in the world, and on building the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland. With the start of operation in 2009, the LHC took over as the highest energy accelerator.\n\nWe have made numerous contributions to building and operating these experiments, particularly for the calorimeters, the devices which measure the energy of particles emitted from collision events.  In both D&Oslash; and ATLAS, the calorimeters rely upon collecting ionization charge from thin liquid argon gaps between heavy metal absorbers. This technique offers the most stable method for obtaining the energies, but the necessary cryogenic and low level analog electronics pose considerable technical challenges.  We led this work in D&Oslash; and supplied the critical high voltage system for ATLAS.   We also led the development and commissioning of a new detector consisting of 50 micron silicon strips for D&Oslash; giving new powerful ways to detect bottom quarks, the harbingers of many new physics processes and developed hardware and strategies for selecting events containing energetic electrons and photons, another signature for new physics.\n\nWe measured the W boson mass to a precision of 5 parts in 10,000.  It is important to know the W boson mass accurately since it can indicate the mass of the Higgs boson postulated as the source of mass to all elementary particles. \n\nWe searched for the Higgs boson directly using two different methods, both first-ever publications..  No single search  is capable of uncovering the Higgs boson, but with our results and several others together, the Tevatron experiments have limited the mass range for the Higgs.\n\nWe have also explored the CP symmetry that postulates that Nature treats particles and antiparticles on an equal footing.  We have measured the extremely rapid oscillation between particles containing a bottom quark and an anti-strange quark to their anti-particles, thus constraining possible new massive particles.  We have measured a small asymmetry between the production of two positive or negative leptons, which, if validated with more data, could help provide an explanation of the asymmetry between matter and anti-matter in the universe.\n\nWe have extended the limits for the existence of exotic new leptoquarks and for substructure within quarks, have measured the rate of production of a Z boson in association with a bottom quark, and made the first observation of the events with a pair of Z bosons.\n\nWe have trained seven PhD students and six postdoctoral researchers during the grant period.   With our D&Oslash; colleagues, we have published over 200 refereed papers in leading journals.  Of these, we were the primary authors of 15.\n\nIn ATLAS, we have developed many of the tools needed to calibrate the energy measurements of electrons, photons and, from the measured imbalance of momentum in events, unseen particles like neutrinos.  We have developed new detectors for measuring the short-lived particles such as bottom quarks within the harsh radiation environment of the LHC.  We have initiated analyses to be completed with the new data from the LHC to measure the rate of production of W bosons, both alone and in conjunction with quark jets, and have established a search for Supersymmetry, a prime candidate to supplant the Standard Model, using combinations of electrons and missing momentum.  Members of our group were primary authors of several publications and conference papers on the ATLAS detector, results from its commissioning prior to delivery of b..."
