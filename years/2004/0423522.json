They propose to conduct mathematical studies in the broad area of functional analysis with particular emphasis in the area of positive operators. They also plan to organize a three-day workshop in Tunisia in the summer of 2005 on the subject of Positivity, Positive Operators and its Applications.  \r\n\r\nScope: The subject of positive operators has been found to be very useful not only for its own sake but also for its many applications, in particular in the area of optimization.  The proposed problems are difficult and in the main stream of modern operator theory.  The PIs are experts in the area of positive operators. The PIs started this collaboration on positive operators in 2002 under a grant from NATO.  The project will support the attendance in the workshop of approximately 5 US researchers and 5 graduate students. While still at an early stage, the research seems to have already been productive in a fairly short amount of time.  The proposed research would continue the PIs investigation of disjointness preserving operators and explore connections with differential equations and extensions to more abstract domains.  \r\n",
