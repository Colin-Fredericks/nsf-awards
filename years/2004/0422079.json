 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cooperative motion is widely accepted as being important for dynamics of glass-forming\r\nliquids, yet the length scales over which cooperative motion occurs are poorly understood.\r\nExperiments are proposed and computer simulations to address cooperative motion in polymers.\r\nWhile cooperative motion is thought to be important for the dynamics of all liquids\r\nnear their glass transition, polymers o.er some unique opportunities for probing cooperative\r\nmotion. Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics simulations will be utilized to directly measure\r\nthe distribution of sizes and shapes of cooperatively relaxed regions, with an emphasis\r\non determining measures that can be applied to real experiments. Dielectric experiments\r\nmeasuring the distribution of segmental relaxation times in miscible polymer blends will\r\nbe used to estimate the temperature dependence of the cooperative size, for each blend\r\ncomponent. Experiments that systematically vary polymer structure (chain length and side\r\ngroups) will also provide less direct measures of the temperature dependence of cooperative\r\nsize in single-component polymer melts. Rheology experiments and Molecular Dynamics\r\nsimulations will explore the connection between segmental dynamics and chain dynamics, in\r\nparallel studies. This connection will allow our models for segmental dynamics in miscible\r\nblends to be extended to predict the terminal dynamics, including the blend viscosity, with\r\nno additional parameters. The intellectual merit of this research will be an improved understanding\r\nof dynamics in polymers and their miscible blends, with particular emphasis on\r\nthe role of cooperative motion and the connection between segmental and chain dynamics.  \r\n                                   \r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed research are threefold. On the one hand, the model\r\nof miscible blend rheology will find immediate pragmatic use in the plastics industry, where\r\npolymer blends are vital for plastics recycling and for metals replacement in the transportation\r\nindustry. The latter enables weight to be reduced without sacrificing strength, thereby\r\nsaving fuel. Simultaneously, understanding of cooperative motion will have far-reaching\r\nconsequences in developing an understanding of liquid state dynamics that goes far beyond\r\npolymers. And finally the proposed research will create learning opportunities for graduate\r\nand undergraduate students. In addition to the involvement of both undergraduate and\r\ngraduate students in the experimental research, the PIs make extensive use of their growing\r\nknowledge of polymer physics in recruiting, advising and teaching at both the undergraduate\r\nand graduate levels.",
