 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents an integrated effort to document the terrestrial\r\nvertebrate biodiversity of the southern borderlands of China, one of the\r\nleast well explored regions worldwide. Specialists working with birds,\r\nmammals, reptiles, and amphibians will staff the expeditions, accompanied by\r\nexperts with various parasite groups (fleas, flies, ticks, lice, nematodes,\r\ncestodes, blood parasites, coccidia, etc.). The 5 expeditions will each\r\nfocus on a different sector of the borderlands region, including the border\r\nareas with Laos, Vietnam, Burma, and northeastern India. Each specialist\r\nwill use tools for inventory that are the 'state of the art' in his or her\r\nown field. The end result will be extensive series of specimens and other\r\nnew biological material for detailed study, as well as numerous scientific\r\npublications documenting local vertebrate and parasite communities,\r\ntaxonomic insights, and new species. Parasite specimens will be collected\r\nand stabilized, with a view towards long-term curation and eventual study.\r\nProject data will be served to the broader scientific community with maximum\r\nefficiency via Internet-based distributed database technology.\r\n\r\nThis project is near-unique in its broad-spectrum assessment of vertebrates\r\nand many groups of parasites. Such a view of vertebrates and the full (or at\r\nleast a broad sample of the) diversity of their parasites is available from\r\nfew places on Earth, making for a new view into the true biological richness\r\nof an area. In the case of the Chinese southern borderlands, not only will\r\nmany of the parasites be unknown to science, but even some or many of the\r\nvertebrate hosts as well. Many new insights into the conservation of\r\nbiological diversity will come from such detailed views of the nature of\r\nthis diversity. This information will go beyond the quick-and-easy\r\nvertebrate-based conservation priorities that currently dominate\r\nconservation biology to provide a detailed view of the true dimensions of\r\nbiological diversity in a complex and little-known region.\r\n\r\n",
