 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Lynn Francesconi of Hunter College Chemistry Department is supported by the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program for her materials chemistry studies on the incorporation of lanthanide (Ln) ions into polyoxometalates (POMs), early transition metal oxide anions that are widely used in heterogeneous catalysis. Various analytical approaches, encompassing stability constant determination, use of species-specific techniques to study speciation (radioactivity, luminescence, and solid-state NMR) as well as routine characterization tools, such as X-ray crystallography and solution multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, will provide thorough understanding of the aqueous and organic solution chemistry of Ln POMs. Understanding solution speciation chemistry of lanthanide polyoxometalates (Ln POMs) is a prerequisite for their successful use in applications such as homogeneous catalysis, medicine, separations, and development of new functional materials.\r\n\r\nThis research will focus on the chemistry of new polyoxometalates (POMs)containing lanthanide ions. Polyoxometalates are early transition metal oxide anions that are widely used in heterogeneous catalysis. Lanthanide substitutions in polyoxometallates may enable applications of these materials in homogeneous catalysis, medicine, separations, and the development of new functional materials. Postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate students will receive multifaceted training in inorganic materials synthesis and characterization.\r\n",
