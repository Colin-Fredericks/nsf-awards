One of the central problems is to determine when such a measure is absolutely continuous. A closely related line of research is concerned with topological properties of attractors, in particular, self-similar and self-affine sets. Especially challenging are the systems that are\r\nnot uniformly contracting and those which have a substantial\r\n``overlap.'' On the ergodic theory side, the project deals with\r\nsubstitution and tiling dynamical systems without discrete spectrum,\r\nas well as with algebraic coding of toral automorphisms. The\r\nso-called non-Pisot case is of particular interest to us, where\r\nit is proposed to use some variants of the beta-transformation defined on self-affine sets.\r\n\r\nTo play the ``Chaos Game'' on the plane, one should specify a family of\r\nplanar tranformations (called an iterated function system)\r\nand iteratively apply one of them at random, with prescribed\r\nprobabilities. Under certain technical conditions (called\r\n``contracting-on-average'') the emerging picture will almost surely\r\n``converge'' to a set called the attractor of the iterated function\r\nsystem. This is a popular method to draw fractals on the computer screen, but it is more than a game: iterated functions are widely used in signal processing, image compression, and simulation algorithms,\r\nas well as in mathematical dynamical systems theory.\r\nThe picture that we see on a computer screen is actually a greytone image, which is an approximation of a measure,\r\nor probability distribution. An important problem is to decide when this distribution has a density.  A related line of research\r\nis to classify the ``zoo'' of fractal objects which arise in the course\r\nof the Chaos Game. The second part of the project is concerned with\r\nanother class of objects which can be obtained by iteration:\r\ninfinite substitutive sequences and self-similar tilings. Now the\r\niteration procedure involves replacing each symbol\r\nby a block of symbols, or each tile by a patch of tiles.\r\nThe limiting object is then used to create a fascinating\r\ndynamical system which we study. Apart from their intrinsic beauty,\r\nsuch systems have found applications in physics.\r\n\r\n",
