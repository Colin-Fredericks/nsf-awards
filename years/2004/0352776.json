Barry Carter, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and N. Ravishankar, Indian Institute of Science will conduct an exploratory study on controlled self-assembly of nanoparticles.  The aim is to understand the fundamentals of heterogeneous nucleation on ionic surfaces that exhibit singularity in electric field along the sharp edges of the surface, in an attempt to understand the broader impact of the basics of nanopatterning on such surfaces.  They will study the nucleation and growth of facets on high-energy ceramic surfaces and examine different surfaces in detail in order to more fully comprehend nucleation and growth processes of facets. \r\n\r\nScope: The Indian investigator is a former postdoctoral research associate of Professor Carter.  The U.S. group is one of the world leaders in ceramics and microstructural characterization; Ravishankar is an assistant professor at the premier Indian Institute of Science, Material Research Center and is producing novel and interesting research results on ceramic surfaces/interfaces.  The investigators have a proven track record as collaborators and are likely to continue producing original scientific results.  The project has important broader impacts regarding opportunities for women and minorities in materials research.  This research is also being supported by the Indian Department of Science and Technology (DST) under the NSF/DST joint program.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
