We currently use two 35-year-old, single-collector instruments that greatly limit both the kind of analyses we can do and the efficiency of data acquisition.  Frequent breakdowns and lack of spare parts for our aging instruments have demanded huge expenditures of time and funds on maintenance.  The AIRIE Program has focused strongly on geochronology, developing and proving methods based on the decay of rhenium (Re) to osmium (Os) in the mineral molybdenite.  This has been possible because of the relatively high concentration of these elements in molybdenite.  But the Re-Os system offers an enormous range of other potential applications that are impossible to pursue with single-collector instruments. Multiple collectors allow us to measure all of the critical isotopic ratios simultaneously, greatly increasing both speed of data acquisition and precision of the analyses.  With multiple ion counters, we will be able to make simultaneous measurements even for very low concentrations.  With these new capabilities, we will expand research to track the behavior of Re and Os in the earth's crust and oceans, explore changes in the earth's oxygen budget, develop new geochronometers (e.g., date the formation of gold), and investigate new isotopic systems to address fundamental questions in particle physics.  Modern lab facilities will help us better attract top-quality students and guest researchers.  The AIRIE Program has a record of collaboration with hundreds of scientists from the mineral industry, government agencies, and academia.  Our expanded capabilities will benefit all of these constituencies.\r\n\r\n",
