How changes in tree species will influence forest ecosystems requires a better understanding of the relationship between tree species and soil microorganisms.  The goals of this research are to examine how tree species influence soil microbes, and to examine how different types of soil microbes affect carbon and nitrogen cycling in forests.  The research will be conducted at the Turkey Hill Plantations in Dryden, NY where plots of individual tree species were planted in a common soil 60+ years ago.  Preliminary results suggest that tree species have a large influence on carbon and nitrogen cycling in these plots and that the differences may result, in part, from differences in soil microbes.  Establishing links between tree species, soil microbes and carbon and nitrogen cycling is critical to assessing ecosystem-level responses to global change. \r\n\r\n",
