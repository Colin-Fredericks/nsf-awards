The use of high k dielectric is imperative for the microelectronic industry and will be implemented well before the end of this decade. The urgency of this technology requires a concerted effort combining molecular level simulations and advanced characterization to uncover the elementary mechanisms fundamental to technological processing.\r\n\r\nIn this project, researchers at Rutgers University led by Yves Chabal and researchers at the Laboratoire d'Architecture et Analyse des Systemes in Toulouse, France, led by Alain Esteve, combine theoretical and experimental expertise.  The U.S. team brings to the collaboration expertise in high-k dielectric characterization.  This is complemented by French specialization in modeling of high-k dielectric growth.  Their partnership builds on initial research on silicon substrates using Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and takes advantage of novel Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) methods developed by the French team.  The KMC methods will complement the more established approaches, such as infrared absorption spectroscopy for experimental input and ab-initio quantum chemicalcalculations for theoretical vibrational mode assignment.  The goal is to uncover new microscopic mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe project is supported jointly by the National Science Foundation and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS).  NSF provides support to the U.S. institution for annual visits to France.  This is complemented by reciprocal funding by the CNRS for visits to the U.S. by the French research team.  \r\n",
