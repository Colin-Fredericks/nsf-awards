 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will enhance to student learning in team environments by providing students with an awareness of how their individual approaches to learning impacts their abilities to work together in teams and by regularly reflecting on barriers to successful teaming through targeted writing exercises, including the development of team charters and biweekly memos addressing team dynamics issues.  \r\n \r\nThe specific goals of the project are to: \r\n\r\n1.   Increase student awareness of how individual approaches to learning affect team \r\n      dynamics through discussion of Learning Combination Inventory (LCI) results. \r\n2.   Help teams identify potential barriers to effective teaming \r\n3.   Provide students with tools to develop  effective teamwork  and project \r\n      management skills through reflective writing assignments. \r\n4.   Develop  faculty  skills  in  facilitating  teamwork  and  student metacognition  in  the learning process. \r\n \r\nResults of this  study  will  be  disseminated  at  the  university  level  through  summer second year of the proposal.  Teamwork is an integral part of most engineering programs and the methods developed in this project can be readily adapted by other universities.\r\n",
