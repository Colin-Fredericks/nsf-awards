 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Duquesne University for the summers of 2004-2006.  The program director is Jeffrey D. Evanseck assisted by co-PI, Jeffry D. Madura.  Ten students will participate in a ten-week program.  Sophomore and junior students, under-represented and women students will be recruited.  Faculty from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Duquesne University, Carlow College, Chatham College and Florida Memorial College will serve as mentors.  The research program is designed to integrate computational and experimental research into broad scientific themes such as nanotechnology, homeland security, advanced instrumentation, pharmaceuticals, forensic sciences and chemical biology.  Each student will work with an experimental faculty mentor in the laboratory and consult with a theoretical faculty liaison to integrate a computational component into their study.    Workshop meetings on computational methods and weekly seminars will be incorporated.  An ethics component will conclude with a regional ethics forum.  The students will participate in a regional undergraduate research symposium.  The effectiveness of the program will be assessed by student participation, student and faculty evaluations and the career progress of the participants. This award is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
