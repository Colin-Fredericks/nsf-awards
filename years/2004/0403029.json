 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research plan is divided into three projects in algebraic combinatorics and\r\nits applications to other areas of mathematics. The first project is concerned\r\nwith several concrete aspects of Schubert calculus on generalized flag\r\nvarieties. Its goal is to find combinatorial formulas for expressing the product\r\nof two Schubert classes (in cohomology) in the basis of Schubert classes; this\r\nis equivalent to counting points in a suitable triple intersection of Schubert\r\nvarieties. The emphasis will be on the multiplication rule in the cohomology of\r\nthe variety of complete flags in complex space. Many different approaches have\r\nbeen used in this area, but the only manifestly positive formulas that exist are\r\nlimited to some easier special cases. The second project is concerned with the\r\ndevelopment of a simple combinatorial model (recently introduced by the\r\ninvestigator in collaboration with A. Postnikov) for the representation theory\r\nof complex semisimple Lie groups, as well as for the Chevalley-type\r\nmultiplication formula in the equivariant K-theory of the corresponding\r\ngeneralized flag variety. The construction is based on combinatorics of\r\ndecompositions in the corresponding affine Weyl group and enumeration of\r\nsaturated chains in the Bruhat order on the (nonaffine) Weyl group. This model\r\nhas several advantages over other combinatorial structures in the area, such as\r\nvarious specializations of the Littelmann path model. The new model will be\r\nextended in several directions, such as: the representation theory of Kac-Moody\r\nalgebras, standard monomial theory, and the quantum K-theory of flag varieties.\r\nThe connections with other models and a deeper study of the combinatorics\r\ninvolved will also be pursued. The third project is concerned with a\r\ncombinatorial study of certain formal group laws related to topology. The main\r\napplication is to certain immersion problems for lens spaces and projective\r\nspaces.\r\n\r\nA unifying theme of the projects outlined here is the emphasis on combinatorics\r\nand computation. During the last decades, computation has gained an important\r\nrole in mathematical research. This stimulated the development of combinatorics,\r\nas it became clear that combinatorial structures are particularly well suited\r\nfor encoding complex mathematical objects, while combinatorial methods are well\r\nsuited for related computations. This research plan is part of the ongoing\r\neffort to perform concrete computations, based on combinatorial structures. One\r\nof the main objects of study are generalized flag varieties. Although these are\r\nclassical varieties, they feature prominently in current mathematical research\r\ndue to their remarkable combinatorial complexity and the subtle interplay\r\nbetween various areas related to them. Examples of such areas relevant to the\r\nprojects in this plan are: enumerative geometry (concerned with problems such as\r\ncounting the lines or planes satisfying a number of generic intersection\r\nconditions, which are equivalent to performing certain cohomology calculations),\r\nand the geometric construction of representations of Lie groups (and, more\r\ngenerally, Kac-Moody groups). Flag varieties also provide a useful testbed for\r\nthe development of combinatorial models relevant to computations in various\r\ncohomology theories of certain projective varieties.\r\n",
