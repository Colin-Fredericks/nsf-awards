 "awd_abstract_narration": "Much research in education now points to the importance of both cognitive and\r\nmotivational processes in determining learning outcomes. Yet we do not yet understand\r\nexactly how these processes interact within the individual learner over time to produce\r\nspecific learning outcomes, and how different forms of instruction and tutoring can\r\ninfluence the interaction of cognition and motivation to facilitate learning. Advanced\r\nlearning technologies such as intelligent tutoring systems typically focus on cognitive\r\nissues, and do not yet address motivational issues. Thus there is a major gap between\r\neducational practice, as supported by learning technologies, and research in cognitive and\r\nmotivational aspects of human learning.\r\nThe goal of the proposed project is to investigate the relations of learner\r\nengagement, cognitive processes, and scaffolding strategies in producing specific\r\nlearning outcomes in mathematics. It brings together an interdisciplinary team of\r\nspecialists in psychology, education, and information technology to pursue this work. The\r\nproject will employ educational software designed to enable us to address and measure\r\ncognitive and motivational factors in systematic ways. It will significantly extend\r\nprevious work on intelligent tutoring systems and computer-based learning assistants to\r\nassess in real time the attention and motivation of individual learners, infer their level of\r\nengagement, and estimate their domain knowledge. The research results will be obtained\r\nin realistic learning conditions: public high school classrooms in Los Angeles, with\r\nstudent populations reflecting the ethnic, linguistic and economic diversity of urban\r\nCalifornia. The software will make instructional decisions based on decision rules used\r\nby expert human tutors who consider motivational and cognitive goals to optimize\r\nlearning outcomes. Instructional strategies will also be instantiated in the form of a\r\nresponsive animated virtual character, to learn if the presence of a human-like\r\npedagogical agent influences the learner.s engagement as well as learning outcomes in\r\nmathematics. Classroom teachers will be able to customize the instruction through\r\ninnovative tools to view continually updated assessments and refine pedagogical\r\ndecisions made by the software. Rich learner data sets will be automatically collected as\r\nstudents work on mathematics problems, and will provide an integrated evaluation linked\r\nto specific learning outcomes, including word problem solving and transfer to novel,\r\nchallenging problems embedded in real-world STEM contexts. To accomplish this goal,\r\nthe researchers will build on the results of two projects developed with prior NSF support: an\r\nempirically validated focus of attention tracking system, and an intelligent tutoring\r\nsystem (ITS) designed specifically to enhance math skills in students who have been\r\ntraditionally under-represented in STEM fields of study.\r\nThe results of the project will have broad societal impact through providing\r\nindividualized, effective web-based instruction in STEM-related mathematics that will be\r\nfreely accessible to students in any high school with access to the Internet. We anticipate\r\nthat the impact will be greatest among students who currently have motivational\r\ndifficulties with mathematics, including women and underrepresented groups. The\r\nintellectual merit of the project will be a deeper understanding of the very nature of\r\nlearning processes through the ability to model in detail and in real time the interaction of\r\ncognition and engagement in the individual learner, and to observe changes in the\r\nlearner.s knowledge as a function of instructional history.",
