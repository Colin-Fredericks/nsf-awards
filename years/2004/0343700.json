 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current trends in communication and information technologies, government deregulation, and\r\ninterest in environmental concerns and data sharing have led to globalization of the engineering\r\nprofession. Employers are increasingly stressing the need for a global perspective in engineering\r\ncurricula. In recent years, engineering accreditation requirements have been revised to\r\nemphasize, among other things, an ability to understand societal and global issues of importance\r\nto engineers. In response, the engineering academic community is reconfiguring its curricula.\r\nOne commonly used tool is to offer engineering students an opportunity to study abroad and\r\nwork on projects in multinational companies in collaboration with students in foreign countries.\r\nThe feasibility and benefits of this approach have been well documented. The participation of\r\nstudents from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in international programs is\r\ngenerally very limited, especially in the engineering disciplines. This proposal is aimed at\r\npromoting and facilitating study abroad programs for engineering students at HBCUs. Barriers\r\nto student engagement in international programs include travel and other associated costs, fear of\r\nlosing time and loss of academic credits, effort involved in learning a new language, and general\r\nignorance of international programs at the curriculum advisor level. The proposed project will\r\nattempt to minimize the effect of these barriers. The project will involve collaborative work\r\namong major HBCUs that have ABET-accredited engineering programs and selected institutions\r\nin France, Germany and Spain through the support of the Global Education for European\r\nEngineers and Entrepreneurs (GE4) organization, corporate partners and research laboratories.\r\nBy effectively using the intervening summer periods, the program will be structured to fit within\r\ncurrent curriculum requirements without significantly increasing the time-to-degree.\r\nThe goals of the project are to enable HBCUs in the US and universities in Europe to promote\r\ninternational exchange of engineering students, to enhance the foreign language skills and the\r\nability of students to understand different social and technical cultures, and to learn how to work\r\nin multi-national engineering teams. The evaluation of the curricula, development of special\r\nforeign language and cultural immersion courses and promotion of the program to potential\r\nstudents are the main activities proposed.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposal is centered on a better understanding of the educational\r\nsystems in Europe in an effort to align curriculum requirements for engineering students to allow\r\nthem to spend a semester or more abroad without delaying graduation. The team assembled to\r\nwork on the project consists of faculty and administrators in colleges of engineering at several\r\nHBCUs and European universities, representatives from GE4, and directors of study abroad\r\nprograms at the campuses. If successful, the project will lay the foundation for significant\r\nincreases in the number of underrepresented engineers who experience international study and\r\nwork as part of their education. The broader impact of the project is rooted in the fact that the\r\nstudent participants in the exchange program belong to underrepresented minorities that have\r\ntraditionally not participated in international programs. The proposed course development to\r\nenhance traditional foreign language courses to include cultural issues especially targeted to\r\nengineering students will be of value to students in other universities also. The course material\r\nwill be made available to other universities on request.\r\n\r\n",
