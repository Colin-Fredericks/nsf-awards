 "awd_abstract_narration": "The spring 2004 ACS Inaugural Symposium for the Nanoscience Subdivision of the American Chemical Society will emphasize interest in fundamental chemistry issues that are central to advancing nanoscience and engineering. These chemistry related areas of nanoscience and engineering have undergone explosive growth in recent years due to the broadly based recognition of the technological importance and scientific challenges involved in the discovery and study of new materials, and due to the influx of scientists from other disciplines who see the opportunities for performing exciting research in this area.  This inaugural symposium for the Nanoscience Subdivision of the American Chemical Society will address topics that include the synthesis, characterization, physical and chemical properties of inorganic nanocrystals and inorganic-organic hybrid materials.  The goal of this ACS meeting is to facilitate collaborations and information exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers with interests in advancing chemistry areas related to nanoscience and engineering.  The NSF funds will be used to defray the expenses of students, post-docs, and junior faculty attending the symposium.\r\n\r\nThe Solid State and Materials Chemistry community continues to have a direct impact on technological advances of high significance to society by training students to design, synthesize, characterize, and fabricate nanoscale materials as novel device materials relevant to advancing thermoelectric, magnetic, and electronic technologies.\r\n",
