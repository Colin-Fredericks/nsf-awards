Kac-Moody Lie algebras are infinite dimensional\r\nalgebras that were first discovered by physicists. A mathematical\r\ncharacterization of these algebras obtained in the 1970's allowed\r\nfor the existence of a wider class of Kac-Moody algebras, namely\r\nhyperbolic algebras. To this day, no classical interpretation of\r\nhyperbolic algebras is known in mathematics, nor has any physical\r\ninterpretation of them been discovered. Yet these algebras\r\ndisplay remarkable symmetry properties which encode deep\r\nand intricate relationships between numbers and geometry.\r\nThese hyperbolic algebras and their groups are the objects\r\nof our study. We have discovered the beginnings of\r\na theory of automorphic forms for lattices in Kac-Moody\r\ngroups over finite fields. Although Kac-Moody groups\r\nhave no obvious algebraic or arithmetic structure, our\r\nwork demonstrates substantial analogies with Lie groups\r\nover fields of positive characteristic. Our approach, in part,\r\nhas been to adapt discrete and combinatorial methods in\r\norder to solve problems in this infinite dimensional setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this program is to advance understanding in\r\nalgebra and symmetries of certain geometric objects with a\r\nparticular emphasis on the mathematics underlying physics\r\nand geometry. \"Kac-Moody Lie algebras\" are infinite dimensional\r\nspaces that are studied both by mathematicians and physicists,\r\nhaving first been discovered in physics as algebras of \"loops\",\r\nthat is, maps from the circle into finite dimensional Lie\r\nalgebras. A mathematical characterization of these spaces,\r\nobtained in the 1970's, allowed for the existence of a wider\r\nclass of Kac-Moody algebras, namely hyperbolic algebras.\r\nTo this day, no classical interpretation of hyperbolic\r\nalgebras is known in mathematics, nor has any physical\r\ninterpretation of them been discovered. Yet these algebras\r\ndisplay remarkable symmetry properties which encode deep\r\nand intricate relationships between numbers and geometry.\r\nThese hyperbolic algebras and their symmetries are the\r\nobjects of our study. A strong theme in this research program\r\nis to adapt discrete and combinatorial methods to solve problems\r\nin algebra. The proposer is developing a team of researchers\r\nin algebra, geometry, physics and combinatorics from a wide\r\nvariety of countries, and including several women, in order\r\nto bring a wealth of diverse viewpoints to this research team.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
