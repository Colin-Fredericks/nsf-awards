Commercial ISEs have shortcomings in terms of selectivity, detection limits, and robustness. The research program addresses these challenges by introducing new matrix materials based on fluoropolymers. These materials are hypothesized to improve biofouling resistance as well as selectivity of the electrodes.  A key goal of the research is to prevent the extraction of electrically neutral lipophilic compounds into sensor membranes and to take advantage of the increased selectivity related to minimizing solvation of interfering ions in the sensor membrane. Synthesis of new perfluorocarbon sensor membranes and characterization of their properties will be performed.  The perfluorinated materials are hypothesized to be promising for sensor applications because they are chemically inert, have been shown to resist cell growth, are highly insoluble in compounds that are lipophilic, and may exhibit higher selectivity than sensors based on other materials.  In terms of the broader impacts, undergraduates will be actively recruited for the project.  This work could lead to a new generation very highly selective sensors, which could be used to diagnose and treat disease, assess environmental problems, and, in general, monitor processes throughout the food processing chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology industries. \r\n\r\n",
