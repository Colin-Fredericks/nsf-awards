 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides Masters-level education in the science and practice of Information Assurance. Students with undergraduate computer science degrees are placed in a specially designed two-year computer security track at CISR, one of the world's preeminent programs combining research and studies in information systems security and information assurance. Through courses involving extensive laboratory exercises and projects, students learn how to design, build, configure and manage systems and networks securely. The program provides students with a firm grounding in the foundations of computer science and conveys concepts and techniques vital for understanding Information Assurance. Students receive regular mentoring by CISR faculty on curriculum and employment options. Experience in leadership and teambuilding are fostered through an innovative computer science program, while students establish esprit de corps through weekly meetings, common study areas, and an IA outreach program to the local community. Each student completes a thesis project in collaboration with other students, faculty, and research staff. The thesis research permits exploration of a topic in depth and ensures an appreciation of the unsolved problems and challenges in Information Assurance, as well as providing valuable experience in critical thinking and writing.",
