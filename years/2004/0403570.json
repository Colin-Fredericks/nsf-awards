 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a request for support to help cover the costs of organizing a conference on \"High Energy Physics and Cosmology\". .  It will take place from December 17-21 at the Lago Mar Hotel in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. . The funds will be used entirely to support graduate students, Post-docs and junior faculty who otherwise could not afford to attend the meeting.  This meeting will be of particular benefit to the students and young scientists attending this meeting as it will provide them with a broad picture of progress in understanding the interface between cosmology and high energy physics.  The conference is well timed to provide information from recent experiments at MiniBooNe, MINOS, KamLAND \r\nSuperK and SNO. It will be a great opportunity for students and PostDocs to learn from the distinguished speakers and become appraised of the most recent exciting data on neutrinos and cosmology. The aim of the NSF funding will be to partial support for lodging, travel and registration for students and young scientists.  A committee is being set up to administer the funds.\r\n\r\nA total of $5000 is requested for 12 months.\r\n",
