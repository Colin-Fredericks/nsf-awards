In this approach major objectives are to: 1) Determine\r\ngenetic relationships between the study populations and other regional\r\ngreen turtle breeding and feeding aggregations; and 2) Obtain an\r\nunprecedented picture of the mating dynamics and population structure of\r\nthese turtles.\r\n\r\nThe scientific significance of the study derives from otherwise\r\nunobtainable insight into how these turtles move in time and space,\r\nrelationships of genetic composition of the turtles and key biological\r\nfactors, and conservation priorities. This information enhances basic\r\nknowledge of  population structure of these turtles in a key but\r\ninadequately researched area, with applications to other species worldwide.\r\nIn the course of the project, education and training are promoted, and\r\nunderrepresented groups from geographically disparate regions are included.\r\nIn addition, a sustained partnership between scientists in Brazil and the\r\nUnited States is expanded, and results are communicated in various\r\nlanguages to diverse audiences. The broader impacts of the research thus\r\ninclude benefits from the diversity of participating programs, frequent\r\npresentations and workshops, improved research content and infrastructure,\r\nand broad dissemination of results.\r\n\r\n",
