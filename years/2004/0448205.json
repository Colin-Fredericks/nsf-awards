Written information from an initial set of campuses who have been particularly successful in graduating underrepresented minority Ph.D.s will be summarized and discussed during a workshop bringing together a few faculty and administrators from each campus.  The outcomes of this workshop will inform further surveying of additional campuses about the strategies that they use for recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority Ph.D. students.  In conjunction with the release of the Action Plan, there will be opportunities for the campuses that are particularly productive in producing underrepresented minority Ph.D.s to network with one another.  Broad dissemination and discussion of the Action Plan will result in an increased understanding and adoption of strategies known to be effective in recruiting and graduating underrepresented minorities in the social, behavioral, and economic sciences.",
