 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physically-Inspired Modeling for Haptic Rendering\r\n\r\nMing C. Lin \r\nDepartment of Computer Science\r\nUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\r\n\r\nThe sense of touch is one of the most important sensory channels \r\nand is used for object identification, data manipulation and\r\nconcept exploration. Therefore, force feedback via haptic \r\n(touch-enabled) devices offers many possibilities for enhanced \r\nhuman-computer interaction.  Extending the frontier of visual \r\ncomputing, this project proposes to develop physically-inspired \r\nmodeling and simulation techniques for high-fidelity haptic \r\ndisplay that will augment visual display.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will be driven by two target \r\napplications in science and education: nanomanipulation \r\nand haptic painting.  Both applications will also be used\r\nto enhance science and art education at middle and high schools. \r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT:   This research is expected to lay the \r\nscientific foundation for an emerging paradigm of \r\nphysically-based haptic interaction with virtual environments. \r\nIt includes new algorithmic insights, efficient computational \r\nmethodology, and system integration for two challenging \r\napplications.  The underlying representations, algorithms \r\nand software systems for fast contact computation, interactive \r\nmodeling of flexible objects, multi-level optimization, \r\nuse of programmable graphics hardware, simulation acceleration \r\ntechniques, and VR device augmentation will also offer fundamental \r\nadvances for virtual environments, physically-based modeling, and \r\nscientific visualization.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT: By extending the frontier of high-fidelity haptic \r\nrendering, the proposed research can develop a significant \r\naugmentation to existing graphical display and scientific \r\nvisualization.  Furthermore, each proposed application has \r\nthe potential of making a considerable impact on its own.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
