They plan to conduct studies in theoretical physics, mainly on the physics of neutrinos in gravitational fields, and many body problem in nuclear structural physics.  The objective is to have better understanding of the neutrino masses and mixings, neutrino propagation through media and in strong gravitational fields, understanding various aspects of core-collapse supernovae, and understanding the origin of elements, especially those produced in rapid neutron capture.\r\n\r\nScope: The research is in an area of U.S. national priority in nuclear science.  The collaboration involves U.S. and Turkish scientists in multidisciplinary activities that connect particle, nuclear, condensed-matter physics and astrophysics.  A U.S. graduate student from the University of Wisconsin will participate in the project and will work with scientists at Koc University, a recently founded institution with excellent promise of contributing to scientific collaboration between Turkey and the United States. \r\n",
