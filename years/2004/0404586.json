 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is to support travel for a combination of junior and senior researchers to attend the 3rd International Symposium on Advances in Computational Heat Transfer, April 19-24, 2004. The International Centre for Heat  and  Mass  Transfer  will  host  the  conference, which will held aboard the MS Midnatsol cruise ship on a cruise along the Norwegian coastline. This international conference on computational  techniques  applied  to  heat  transfer will  assemble  scientists  and  engineers working in fields related to, and requiring, computational methods for modeling all modes of heat transfer, including  coupling with  fluid flow.  The requested funds will provide partial travel support for 12 emerging researchers and 6 senior researchers.  The senior participants will deliver keynote addresses at the conference.  Computational hardware and software, and their applications to the fields of heat transfer and fluid flow, are changing rapidly. The conference will provide technical exchange, identification of the state-of-the-art, and the projection of future needs and trends in numerically solving such problems.  The conference should be beneficial to the US participants and will expose them to new and exciting ideas and concepts from the international participants.  The previous conferences in this subject have attracted the most prominent researchers from around the world, such that the scientific impact of the discussions is extremely valuable with interchange across many disciplines.  In addition, in conjunction with his colleagues at the conference, the PI will conduct an assessment of cyberinfrastructure needs for the advancement of computational heat transfer and fluid mechanics and will deliver a report to the Program Director within 60 days of the conclusion of the conference.  This award has been funded by the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing of the Chemical and Transport Systems Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
