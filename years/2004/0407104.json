 "awd_abstract_narration": "WGBH's Science Unit is requesting funds to produce for NOVA a two-hour television special based on David Bodanis' book \"E=mc2:  A Biography of the World's Most Famous Equation.\"  Combining dramatic and documentary techniques, the program uses Einstein's iconic equation to explore the physics behind the equation and the nature of the scientific process.  A media initiative, an interactive Web site, and an outreach campaign broaden the program's impact beyond the television broadcast.  \"E=mc2\" is intended for prime-time broadcast on PBS in the fall of 2005, to coincide with the centennial of Einstein's \"Miracle Year,\" and should reach an initial audience of seven million viewers.  Outreach kits will be made available for free to 16,000 public libraries and 1,000 after-school programs.  Notification of educational resources will be sent to all 14,000 high school physics teachers around the country.  A formative evaluation of the program and a summative evaluation of the program and outreach materials will ensure that \"E=mc2\" achieves its ultimate purpose:  to enhance public understanding of science and promote scientific careers.\r\n\r\nKey Project Personnel:\r\n\r\nDirector of the WGBH Science Unit and Senior Executive Producer of NOVA:  Paula S. Apsell\r\n\r\nWriter/Director:  Kevin Macdonald\r\n\r\nProducer:  John Smithson\r\n\r\nFormative Evaluation:  Multimedia Research\r\n\r\nSummative Evaluation:  Goodman Research Group\r\n",
