 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Conference on Computational Harmonic Analysis is \r\nheld in conjunction with the 19th Shanks Lecture Series, featuring \r\nSteve Smale as the Shanks speaker. This conference plays a crucial \r\nrole in impacting developments of science and technology based on \r\ncomputational harmonic analysis, identifying new trends, and \r\nproviding an important common link to other scientific and \r\nengineering disciplines at large. The emphasis of the conference is \r\non the state-of-the-art developments on such topics as learning \r\ntheory, computational mathematics, and applications to signal/image \r\nprocessing, information technology, and life sciences. It is intended \r\nto highlight computational mathematics and its connections with \r\ninterdisciplinary research areas, and brings researchers and graduate \r\nstudents together for in-depth discussions on all aspects of \r\ncomputational harmonic analysis.\r\n\r\nThe field of computational harmonic analysis is a recently \r\nestablished and still fast growing area of mathematical analysis. It \r\nhas been providing common links and tools to other areas of \r\nmathematical sciences, natural and life sciences, and engineering. \r\nNew developments with a very broad spectrum of applications, such as\r\nwavelets, frames, radial basis functions, spline functions, curve and \r\nsurface subdivisions, sampling, and learning theory, have found their \r\nmathematical home in computational harmonic analysis. This forum for \r\ninterdisciplinary research is expected to continue for the \r\nforeseeable future.",
