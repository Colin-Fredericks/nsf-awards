 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to West Chester University of Pennsylvania under the direction of Dr. Russell Vreeland for support of a state of the art geological molecular microbiology laboratory facility.  This one of a kind facility combines geological and molecular biological research equipment.  Researchers plan use this equipment to extract DNA, RNA and living microorganisms directly from ancient rocks and crystals while keeping the samples under sterile conditions.  This project represents an improvement and expansion of the techniques previously used by the same West Chester University scientists while finding and describing the world's oldest living bacteria.  The heart of the laboratory is a special microscope that contains an attached microdrill able to produce a sample of rock only 30 microns (0.00011 inches) in diameter.  This microscope/drill is able to map and photograph a rock, drill the hole and produce the sample based on computer commands from a remote station.  In this way the samples are produced in a sterile area without human contact.  These tiny samples can then be moved directly into equipment that amplifies and sequences both large and small pieces of DNA which the researchers will use to study the genes of bacteria that populated Earth from time periods before the dinosaurs existed.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to its research functions, the facility will provide extensive educational experience for students from several departments at West Chester University a member of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education.  Located in the Biology Building the DNA sequencer and its related equipment will be used by undergraduate students conducting research with Dr Vreeland and other members of the Biology Department.  The facility will host several laboratory classes in Molecular Biology, Recombinant DNA technology, Microbial Ecology, and Microbial Physiology among others.  In demonstrations and lectures reminiscent of the popular CSI TV series students from Criminal Justice and Forensics classes will get first hand experience with DNA sampling, sample care and acquisition and analysis of DNA data.  \r\n\r\nDue to the uniqueness of this entire facility, world renowned scientists from numerous other universities and research facilities are already contemplating visits to use the sterile microdrill system conduct their own research in dating ancient salt brines, obtain rock samples for analysis and even attempt to extract DNA from their own rock samples.  This be a premier research facility likely to attract visiting world class researchers the campus and exposing students to state of the art scientific equipment.  \r\n",
