 "awd_abstract_narration": "The self-assembly process for bottom-up construction of nanostructures is of\r\nfundamental importance to the emerging discipline of Nanoscience. For example,\r\nthe self-assembly of DNA tile nanostructures into 2D lattices can be used to\r\nmanufacture patterned nanostructures from smaller unit nanostructures\r\ncomponents known as DNA tiles on which other molecules such as metallic\r\nparticles and proteins can be affixed, and DNA tiling lattices can be used to\r\nperform parallel universal computation. However, self-assemblies at the\r\nmolecular scale are prone to a quite high rate of error, ranging from\r\napproximately between 0.5% to 5%, and the key barrier to large-scale\r\nexperimental implementation of DNA tiling is this significant error rate in the self-assembly\r\nprocess. The problem of tiling errors is particularly critical for DNA\r\nlattices that use computational tilings to produce complex patterns, The limitation\r\nand/or elimination of these errors in self-assembly is perhaps the single most\r\nimportant major challenge to nanostructure self-assembly. The goals of the\r\nproposed research are to develop methods for error-resilient self-assembly; to\r\nanalyze these by probabilistic, kinetic analysis and computer simulation; and to\r\ndemonstrate these error-resilient self-assembly methods by a series of laboratory\r\nexperiments. Research will be done in the context of DNA tiling assemblies. Prior\r\nwork by Winfree provided a method to decrease tiling self-assembly errors\r\nwithout decreasing the intrinsic error rate of assembling a single tile, however, his\r\ntechnique resulted in a final assembled structure that is four times the size of the\r\noriginal one. This research team at Duke University has developed compact\r\nerror-resilient tiling methods that do not increase the size of the tiling assembly.\r\nThey will test their new error-resilient tiling methods that use overlay redundancy\r\nsuch that a single pad mismatch between a tile and its immediate neighbor forces\r\none or more further pad mismatches between adjacent tiles in the neighborhood\r\nof this tile. The research will use a combination of theoretical and experimental\r\nmethods. Theoretical probabilistic kinetic analysis and empirical studies of the\r\ncomputer simulation of tilings will first be used to validate these error-resilient\r\noverlay redundancy tiling methods; the analysis will allow prediction of the\r\nreduced error rate and verify the speed of the assembly is not reduced. Following\r\nthis, actual experimental demonstrations will be made using DNA tiles, The\r\noverall goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of error-free assemblies of thousands\r\nof tiles.",
