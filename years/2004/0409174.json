Colloid deposition at\r\nair-water and solid-water interfaces plays an important role in controlling the transport rates and\r\nporewater concentrations of colloids in the vadose zone. Despite the importance of colloids in\r\nvadose-zone processes, a theory suitable for predicting colloid deposition in unsaturated porous\r\nmedia does not exist.\r\nThe focus of this proposed research is to take steps towards filling this gap in knowledge\r\nby defining, in a quantitative way, the fundamental relationships between colloid-deposition\r\nkinetics at air-water and solid-water interfaces and the physical properties of the soil-water-colloid\r\nsystem. These relationships will be derived through analysis of a suite of pore-scale\r\nsimulations of water flow and advective-diffusive colloid transport through partially saturated\r\nvoid spaces. Modern models for air-water configuration in variably saturated porous media will\r\nbe used to specify the geometry of the porewater domains for which the pore-scale simulations\r\nof colloid transport will be conducted. Regression analysis of the results of the flow-and-transport\r\nsimulations is expected to yield power-law equations that express the rate of colloid\r\ncollisions with air-water and solid-water interfaces as functions of fluid-flow velocity, colloid\r\nsize and density, porous-medium texture, and capillary pressure (which controls water\r\nsaturation). Except for the need to account for the presence of the air phase, the proposed\r\napproach for deriving the power-law equations for colloid-interface collision rates is\r\nconceptually similar to published approaches used to formulate the colloid-filtration equations\r\nfor water-saturated porous media.\r\nPredictions of colloid-deposition kinetics made with the power-law equations will be\r\ncompared with measurements of colloid deposition made in laboratory column experiments. In\r\nthese experiments, the sensitivity of colloid-deposition rates to variations in colloid diameter,\r\ngrain-size, grain-size distribution, porewater velocity, and capillary pressure will be examined.\r\nComparison of measured and predicted deposition rates will reveal deficiencies in the new\r\ntheory and help direct its refinement.\r\nFindings from this study will advance current knowledge of mass-transport processes in\r\npartially saturated geologic materials and substantially improve our understanding of key mass-transfer\r\nreactions that affect porewater concentrations of colloids within the vadose zone. This\r\nproposed research represents a first attempt at deriving and testing a colloid-filtration theory for\r\nunsaturated porous media that is needed to make quantitative inferences regarding colloid\r\nmobility in the vadose zone. Such a theory should make an important contribution towards\r\naddressing critical water-quality issues of national concern that are related to the movement of\r\nmicrobial pathogens and colloid-associated contaminants through near-surface environments.",
