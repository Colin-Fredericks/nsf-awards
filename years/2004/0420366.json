 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the Department of Chemistry at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology will acquire an Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) Spectrometer. Faculty from the Departments of Physics, Chemistry, and Earth and Environmental Sciences will use this ESR instrument to carry out their research, including adsorption studies on carbon nanotubes; in situ heterogeneous catalysis investigations related to lean-burn engines; the application of zeolites in ground-water remediation; and the modification of the electronic properties of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNT) due to chemical introduction of defects.  \r\n\r\nAn electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrometer is especially valuable as it provides information on short-lived free radicals.  Free radicals play a major role in the initiation of tumor growth and are intermediates in many important chemical reactions. These studies should have a strong impact in the environmental arena, as they may lead to a reduction in automotive emissions and cleaner groundwater.  In addition, the ESR instrument will be used in a variety of undergraduate laboratory courses in the Chemistry and Physics departments.\r\n",
