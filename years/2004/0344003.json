 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study how genes control the shapes of \r\nliving things.  It will identify specific genes that affect the \r\nshapes of fly wings, and will assess their relative effects and \r\npossible modes of action.  Fly wings offer a fast, cost-effective \r\nway to investigate the basic principles of genetic shape \r\ncontrol, because they can be easily projected and magnified, \r\nand their shapes can be rapidly measured with a computer.  \r\nThis makes it possible to analyze thousands of measurements \r\nof individual differences, which are required to study the small \r\neffects of many genes.  Previous work in mice and flies \r\nindicates that many minor genes are involved in shape control.  \r\nIn this study the new technique of microarray analysis will be \r\ncombined with massively replicated measurements to find and \r\nidentify these genes.  \r\n     In many cases we know how genes guide cells to \r\ndifferentiate into the separate parts of organisms, but not much \r\nis known about how growth is subsequently regulated to \r\ndetermine the final shapes of parts.  Understanding differential \r\ngrowth regulation in normal cells should advance our \r\nknowledge in areas of medical interest, with possible \r\napplications to abnormal growth, birth defects, and the origins \r\nof cancer.  Frequently, basic research in fruit fly genetics has \r\nled to major advances in human genetics.  \r\n",
