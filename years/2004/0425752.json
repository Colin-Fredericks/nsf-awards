The conference will explore topics in mathematics and computer science that could be included in biological science courses, as well as topics in biology that could be included in mathematics courses.  The agenda of the conference will include the availability and development of materials supporting these linkages, developments in undergraduate education that might inform teachers in high schools and alternative models for teacher training at the interface between biology and mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe conference will produce a report focusing on future challenges in making the interface between biology and mathematics accessible to high school students.  \r\n",
