 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a growing statistical evidence that many price processes\r\n(stock prices, index values, exchange rates, interest rates)\r\nexhibit presence of very small, but very frequent jumps. Moreover,\r\nthis  behavior seems to be unstable over time, sometimes the\r\npresence of small jumps is very strong, but sometimes almost\r\nnonexistent. Traditional decision control analysis uses diffusion\r\nmodels with possible addition of infrequent large jumps to study\r\nproblems related to the market control.\r\n\r\nBecause of the statistical evidence of jump presence in many\r\nprice processes, it is proposed to study:\r\n1) How the market agent (investor, regulator) should\r\nreact to the presence of jumps? What is the optimal strategy to use?\r\n2) Is the optimal strategy different for the problem without jumps\r\nin contrast to the problem with jumps? Is the strategy for the\r\nproblem without jumps (diffusion model) robust in the sense that\r\nif used for the problem with jumps, it performs reasonably well?\r\n3) Given that there is a significant uncertainty about the\r\npresence of frequent small jumps in the first place and the\r\nstrategy found for the diffusion problem is not robust, find a\r\nreasonable strategy which would perform well in both models.\r\n\r\n",
