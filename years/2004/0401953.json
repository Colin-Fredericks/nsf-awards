This conference will foster a mutually beneficial interaction between\r\nmathematicians and physicists. In addition, the activities are expected to play a \r\nrole in advertising potential applications of these emerging methods elsewhere in \r\ngeometry and topology.  \r\n\r\nGeometric and homotopy-theoretic methods have proved of increasing\r\nimportance to the study of string theory and associated areas of\r\nphysics in the last few years: we may mention Fukaya and Kontsevich's\r\nintroduction of A1-categories and the role of manifolds of G2-holonomy\r\nas just two examples. The flow of ideas has gone in the other direction\r\nas well. For example, string duality has suggested new directions of\r\nresearch on derived categories of algebraic varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
