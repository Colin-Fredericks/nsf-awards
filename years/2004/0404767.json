 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research is in Geometric Group Theory, specifically on \r\nproblems pertaining to the geometry, topology and asymptotics of the \r\nword problem, particularly along avenues initiated by Gromov in his \r\nseminal book \"Asymptotic Invariants of Infinite Groups.\"  A first \r\ndirection concerns isoperimetric and filling length functions, a \r\nmeeting point of geometry and algorithmic complexity.  Examples of \r\nproblems for attack here are whether Cohen's Double Exponential \r\nTheorem is sharp, and to establish long standing claims of Thurston \r\nabout isoperimetric functions of the Special Linear Groups.  Also \r\naddressed in the proposal is a question of Gromov about the uniqueness \r\nof a limit of a group viewed from increasingly distant vantage points \r\n(an asymptotic cone); a line of attack is being pursued in \r\ncollaboration with M.R. Bridson.  Another area is the \"grammar of the \r\nWord Problem\", where geometry meets linguistic complexity.  The P.I. \r\nproposes to investigate the combings of nilpotent groups as well as \r\napplications to the Andrews-Curtis Conjecture.  The proposal includes \r\ncollaborative work and it is anticipated that the inter-disciplinary \r\nnature of the work will enable additional collaborative efforts both \r\nin the United States and abroad.\r\n\r\nThe Word Problem was posed by Max Dehn in 1912, who presciently \r\ndescribed it as a \"fundamental problem whose solution is very \r\ndifficult and which will not be possible without a penetrating study \r\nof the subject.\"  The Word Problem for a group (a fundamental \r\nalgebraic object capturing symmetries) asks for a systematic method \r\n(in modern terms, an algorithm) which, given a finite list (a \"word\") \r\nof basic symmetries (distinguished group elements known as \r\n\"generators\"), declares whether or not their product is the identity \r\n(the trivial symmetry that moves nothing).  One of the crowning \r\nachievements of 20th century mathematics was the construction by Boone \r\nand Novikov of groups for which no such algorithm can exist.  However, \r\nthat is by no means the end of the story.  The Word Problem transcends \r\nits origins in algebra, decidability and complexity theory, and turns \r\nout to be a bridge to geometry and topology, as well as to linguistic \r\ncomplexity.  To a group we can associate a topological space and vice \r\nversa.  Recognising a word to be trivial amounts to spanning a loop \r\nwith a disc in a corresponding space, and geometrical features of this \r\ndisc (such as area) translate to algorithmic complexity measures (such \r\nas time) of the Word Problem.  Moreover, words over a group form \r\ngrammars whose linguistic features relate to the ease of navigating \r\naround the corresponding space.  Thus there are tantalising links \r\nbetween minimal surfaces (soap films) and algorithmic complexity, and \r\nbetween geometry of spaces and grammars.  These are the connections \r\nthe P.I. proposes to develop and exploit.\r\n\r\n",
