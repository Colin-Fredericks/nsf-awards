This conference is the 18th in a series of conferences sponsored by the International Plant Growth Substance Association (IPGSA). These meetings are held every three years and the last two were convened in Makuhari Messe, Tokyo (1998) and Brno, Czech Republic (2001). Plant hormones regulate almost all aspects of growth and development, beginning with seed germination through the growth of parent plant to the development of the flower and the formation of seeds that perpetuate the plant's life cycle. This important international meeting will introduce younger US investigators to this exciting area of research. The conference includes plenary sessions and symposia as well as poster sessions where investigators display their most recent work. The program promises to be exciting and will stimulate research on plant growth regulators in the USA. These molecules have long been established as important for U.S. agriculture, and our understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of their action is essential for the long-term sustainability of agriculture. \r\n\r\n",
