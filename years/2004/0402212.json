 "awd_abstract_narration": "0402212\r\nFraser\r\nIntellectual Merit:  Polymeric metal complexes (PMCs) are a new class of multifunctional biomaterials that combine detection, protection, targeting, triggered release and degradation functions in imaging agents and drug delivery vectors.  Molecular weight and architectural control (i.e. valency of bio-ligand presentation) are attainable by living polymerization.  Luminescent and stimuli responsive metal complexes with bipyridine (bpy) and B-diketonate macroligands are investigated.  Luminescent Ru tris(bpy) PEG-PEI materials tagged with antibodies to prostate specific membrane antigen are of interest as short interfering RNA delivery agents for knock out of the androgen receptor (which is believed to be critical for disease progression).  LDV, RGD and other adhesion peptide bioconjugates of metal PLA-PEGs are designed for use as molecular probes targeting leukocytes and as anti-inflammatory drug delivery agents.   Ru PLA-PAA systems are generated for imaging, mucoadhesive drug delivery, and models for multifunctional photodynamic therapeutics.  These many uses for PMC biomaterials are also advanced by fundamental studies of their optical, nanoscale self-assembly, and degradation properties under both controlled and more complex biological conditions. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The group and collaborative team members range from undergraduates to faculty, and often include gender, racial, and geographic minorities.  Contributions of the interdisciplinary research to science through publications and presentations are augmented by numerous activities in the university and community.   These include mentoring promising young scientists, building infrastructure for interdisciplinary intellectual exchange; and conveying the importance and excitement of scientific discovery to non-scientists by hosting lab visits and speaking in public forums.  Potential technological benefits are in molecular imaging, drug delivery, sensing, catalysis, and photonic materials.\r\n",
