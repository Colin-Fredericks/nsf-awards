These linear molecules emit strong and numerous radio signals. \r\nFurthermore, their vibrations can be detected in warm regions of the spectrum, which renders them excellent probes of star-forming cloud cores, protoplanetary disks, and of gas outflows from dying stars.  The U.S. investigator, Mark Morris of the University of California at Los Angeles, and the French investigator, Laurent Wiesenfeld of the Universite de Grenoble I, will investigate the astrophysical value of the molecule family cyanopolyynes.  They will first calculate collision probabilities to construct a model of  cyanopolyyne line emissions, then, observe these molecules at radio and infrared facilities in Europe and in the U.S. \r\n\r\nThe project takes advantage of complementary expertise of the U.S. and French investigators and provides access to a single-dish millimeter telescope, IRAM, located in Granada, Spain.  An American graduate student will participate in the theoretical calculations and observations.  \r\n\r\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) support this joint project.  NSF provides funding for visits to France and to Spain by the U.S. investigator and his student.  The CNRS will cover the expenses of visits to the United States and Spain by the French investigator.\r\n",
