Toronto)\r\n\r\nTitle: Applications of Transportation Theory to Nonlinear Dynamics\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the analysis of a collection of variational\r\noptimization and dynamical evolution problems centered around the theme\r\nof optimal transportation --- which enters the dynamical setting\r\nwhenever the evolution conserves a scalar locally. The central problem can be \r\ncaricatured as follows:Given a distribution of iron mines throughout the \r\ncountryside,  and a distribution of factories which require iron ore,  decide \r\nwhich mines should supply ore to each factory in order to minimize the total\r\ntransportation costs.  Here the cost per ton of ore transported from the\r\nmine at x to factory at y is specified by a function c(x,y) --- so the \r\nproblem can be formulated as a linear program.  However, when the mines and\r\nfactories are distributed continuously throughout Euclidean space or\r\na curved landscape with obstacles --- and the cost is related to the\r\ndistance on this landscape, then the problem has a rich structure and\r\ndeep connections to geometry and non-linear PDE which have only begun \r\nto be explored.  Incarnations of this problem embed in current models for\r\nsurprisingly diverse phenomena.  Along with basic questions concerning \r\nthe structure and qualitative features of optimal mappings, the proposed\r\nresearch addresses models for  front formation in the atmosphere, dissipative \r\nequilibration in kinetic theory, fluid flow, and granular materials and  \r\ngeometric and dynamical inequalities.\r\n\r\nAfter half a century of mathematical neglect, the past decade witnessed a \r\nrevival of interest in optimal transportation,  and watched as it blossomed into \r\na fertile field of investigation as well as a vibrant tool for exploring diverse \r\napplications within and beyond mathematics. The transformation occurred partly \r\nbecause long-standing issues could finally be resolved,  but also because \r\nunexpected connections were discovered which linked these questions to problems \r\nin physics, geometry, computer vision, partial differential equations, earth \r\nscience and economics.  The time is ripe for a collaborative effort on an\r\ninternational scale to explore existing connections and unearth new ones, while \r\nsimultaneously developing the basic theory of optimal maps and introducing \r\nstudents and colleagues to the challenges and promise of the field --- thus for \r\nthe formation of a focused research group with these goals.  The core of our \r\nplan is to arrange sustained interactions between and around members of the \r\ngroup,  who in addition to collaborating scientifically, will work together over \r\nthe next several years to create the research environment and manpower necessary \r\nfor transportation research to flourish.  To achieve this goal, we plan to \r\norganize two workshops on different aspects of the subject.  Furthermore, we \r\nplan to share the responsibilities of training graduate students and \r\npostdoctoral fellows, by using funds from the grant to support young \r\nresearchers.  This unique arrangement will give participants\r\naccess to an unusually broad assortment of perspectives and expertise.\r\nMoreover,  we believe a  three-year nurturing window for young researchers to \r\nlearn the subject and become involved --- if continued now --- will ultimately \r\nfurther advance progress in the field by more than a decade.\r\n",
