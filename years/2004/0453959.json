 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's propose a multidisciplinary study of Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks along an east-west transect in the Wrangell - Petersburg - Prince of Wales Island area of SE Alaska (= Wrangell transect).  Previous research demonstrates that integration of paleomagnetic studies with geochronologic, therinochronologic, barometric, and structural geologic observations can produce important insights into the tectonic evolution of the Insular superterrane and Coast Mountains orogen in western BC and SE Alaska.  The PI's recent results from near Prince Rupert show that paleomagnetism is a key component of multidisciplinary efforts investigating exhumed shallow and mid-crustal sections.  When accompanied by geologic observations resulting from a carefully coordinated multidisciplinary research program, paleomagnetic data on intrusive igneous rocks 'eld critical information on the tectonic development of deformed yi\r\nregions that cannot otherwise be obtained.  For example, the PI's have documented that panels of crust containing the Paleocene Quottoon igneous complex east of the Coast shear zone have experienced east-side-up tilts ranging to 40' during Eocene extension.  In addition, their geochronologic, palcomagnetic, barometric, and structural geologic data suggest that the midCretaceous Ecstall pluton was folded during west-directed thrusting.  These discoveries are fundamental to understanding the crustal architecture and tectonic development of the continental margin in the northern Cordillera.\r\n\r\nBecause igneous rocks were emplaced into this part of the magmatic arc during the Cretaceous, throughout the Paleogene, and into the Miocene, the Wrangell transect provides the opportunity to track deformation of an evolving convergent to strike-slip plate margin in space and time.  Methods will include U/Pb geochronology of zircon and spheric, Al-in-homblende barometry, 40 Ar/39 Ar thennochronology, (U-Th)/He dating of zircon, metamorphic petrology, and structural geologic investigations in addition to paleomagnetic analysis.  Preliminary investigations on the eastern portion of the transect indicate that this area experienced - 1 7' ESEside-up tilt about an axis with azimuth 22' since 20 Ma.  Observations from across the transect indicate that paleomagnetic directions from Cretaceous plutons are variable, with both concordant and discordant inclinations.  Paleomagnetic study of the Cretaceous and Tertiary igneous rocks of the Wrangell transect, coupled with the geochronologic, thennochronologic, and barometric analyses, can determine: (1) when and where Cenozoic defontiation occurred; and (2) whether regionally consistent tilting/folding and/or large-scale transport can account for discordant paleomagnetic directions from Cretaceous plutons.  Combined with results from the Prince Rupert area, successful completion of the proposed research can provide a comprehensive model for the tectonic and paleogeographic evolution of the Coast Mountains and Insular superterrane for the past I 00 m.y.\r\n",
