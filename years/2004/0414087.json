 "awd_abstract_narration": "Billings\r\n\r\n     The overall objective of this work is to develop a thorough\r\nunderstanding of emergent dynamics in epidemiological models as a practical\r\nway to prevent disease outbreaks.  Theproject has four parts: 1) developing\r\nnew, detailed models, with the advantage of analysis by dynamical systems;\r\n2) incorporating time-dependent parameters that more accurately capture\r\nclimate variability and other nonstationary behavior; 3) adding stochastic\r\nperturbations to analyze emergent dynamics; and 4) controlling the system.\r\nThese problems are studied using theory from dynamical systems, topology,\r\nnumerical analysis, asymptotics, and stochastic perturbations.  In this\r\nstudy, the investigator includes noise, time-dependent parameters, and\r\nspatial networks, which are known to combine to produce unexpected\r\ncomplexity in systems, or emergent dynamics.  In particular, the\r\ninvestigator builds on recent work developing the Galerkin Transport\r\nMatrix, which allows a rigorous study of stochastic dynamics in the context\r\nof the topology of the system.  This tool can identify precursor behavior\r\nto outbreaks, allowing the control of the dynamics by a parameter, such as\r\nvaccination, to avoid these patterns and avert epidemics.\r\n\r\n     Disease dynamics have been modeled and studied for hundreds of years. \r\nYet, epidemiologists cannot accurately predict large-scale outbreaks or\r\nepidemics in the most common diseases.  Currently, there are fears of new\r\nstrains of deadly diseases and calls for a defensive plan.  Questions are\r\nbeing asked about which vaccination or quarantine strategies are necessary\r\nto avert outbreaks.  Due to ethical issues of testing vaccination\r\nstrategies on people, epidemiologists must rely on data from past epidemics\r\nand corresponding mathematical models to guide these decisions.  Models are\r\npowerful tools if their results are interpreted correctly.  They can\r\ncapture qualitative dynamics that point to patterns and mechanisms that\r\nenable disease persistence in a population.  They can also predict the\r\nsuccess of an action taken to avert an outbreak.  In collaboration with\r\nepidemiologists, a better mathematical understanding of the possible\r\ndynamics in these models can lead to improved methods of disease control. \r\nThis work can also be extended to new models to describe the propagation of\r\nmultiple disease strains and certain types of computer viruses.\r\n",
