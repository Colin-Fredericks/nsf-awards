 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) This project focuses on enhancement of our undergraduate chemistry and environmental science programs by introducing high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the laboratory courses of instrumental analysis and environmental chemistry as well as in multidisciplinary environmental projects. Laboratory experiments are being adapted from the research and educational literature and implemented into the undergraduate curricula as well as the research projects that are tied to local environmental issues. These laboratory experiments allow our students to perform qualitative and quantitative analysis of environmental and biological samples, and to develop problem-solving skills by conducting open-ended research projects. The integration of the lab experiments with the research projects increases students' competence in chemical analysis, and thus motivates them to further explore/solve \"real world\" chemistry and environmental problems. We plan to disseminate the outcome of this project by hosting a professional workshop that targets the chemistry faculty at local community colleges and science teachers at local high schools.",
