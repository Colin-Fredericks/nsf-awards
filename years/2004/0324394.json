 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project seeks a better understanding of tsunamis, and the associated runup, of tsunamis generated by near shore landslides, including sub-aerial and submerged landslides.  The project involves an integrated experimental and theoretical (numerical) component to develop simulation models based on the two-phase Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and the discrete element model (DEM).  Besides the measurements of free surface elevations and runup heights, optical techniques, such as Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV), will be used to measure both fluid velocities and materials slide velocities in detail.  The large-scale experiments will be performed at the Oregon State University NEES (Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation) wave basin.\r\n\r\nThe objectives are: (1) to characterize waves generated by three-dimensional solid body slides, and during the inception, deformation, and propagation of granular (material) landslides; (2) to parameterize the run-up and shoreward inundation associated with tsunamis generated by granular and solid body landslides; (3) to improve the capability of numerical models of the complex dynamic interactions among tsunami, shoreline, and moving granular and solid body slides; and (4) to establish benchmark problems for the study of waves generated by granular and solid body slides with high quality experimental data for validating numerical simulation models.\r\n\r\nThe research operates at the interface between several traditional fields of science and engineering: fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, soil mechanics and applied mathematics.  It integrates analytical and experimental approaches with measurements from experiments, leading to the rational development of new and improved numerical models.  In addition, the results of this study will be incorporated into the revision of a CD-ROM; Tsunami: Understanding the Giant Wave, which has been distributed to many high schools, science museums, libraries, and research institutes.  A web site will be established to disseminate information on research progress and findings.\r\n",
