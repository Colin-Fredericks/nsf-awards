Davis of the California Institute of Technology and Veronique Dufaud of the Laboratoire de Chimie, Ecole Normale Superieure in Lyon, France focuses on preparing solid catalysts of structural uniformity.  The proposed project is an extension of the U.S. and French investigators previous work on synthesis and catalytic behavior of mesoporous silicas containing positioned sulfonic acid groups. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThe objective is to investigate structure-property relationships of organic-inorganic hybrid materials where the inorganic component provides surface area and porosity and the organic groups are organized on its surface. Results from zeolite-based catalysts suggest strong correlation between nanoscopic/mesoscopic uniformity and high selectivity.  The investigators propose to create structural uniformity that contains:  (1) multiple organic groups in precise arrangement in order to study the effects of cooperativity; and (2) multiple organic group types to catalyze multistep reaction pathways.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe proposal adds an international dimension to an active NSF - NIRT (Nanoscale Science and Engineering Independent Research Team) research award on zeolite nanoparticles.   The U.S. investigator is expert in synthesis and characterization of organic-inorganic hybrid materials and has broader experience in catalysis.  This is complemented by French expertise in synthesis and surface organo metallic chemistry. Their efforts will advance understanding and creation of new catalysts.  Catalytic activity is the basis for the chemistry industry.  The project gives a U.S. postdoctoral research and graduate student an international experience via research immersion at a leading French institution. The project advances the student's international research skills and assists with developing international connections for future. \r\n",
