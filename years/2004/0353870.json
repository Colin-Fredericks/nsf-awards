 "awd_abstract_narration": "Valparaiso University will host an REU program for 9 students in mathematics. Students will be recruited nationwide. Minority students, students early in their mathematical career and students from institutions with no Ph.D. program will be given priority. The program will last 9 weeks and will provide the participants with housing, $3,000 stipend and travel reimbursement.\r\n\r\nThe students will work on research projects in three small groups with a faculty mentor. The projects will be chosen from topics in combinatorics, graph theory, analysis and topology. A graduate student will serve as a consultant/mentor throughout the program. In addition to conducting original research, the participants will have the opportunity to visit graduate programs, listen to guest lectures and improve their oral and written communication skills. Each research group will present their progress weekly to all the participants, and each research project will close with a written report. The participants will be encouraged to present their finding at regional and national conferences. Participants will also be encouraged to pursue the publication of their results.\r\n",
