Determining the mechanical properties of these fibers will provide new insights into the wound healing process and advance our understanding of heart attacks and strokes.  There has been considerable interest  in determining the response of fibrin clots to mechanical stresses. \r\nMost of  the investigations in the past have mainly focused on the  bulk mechanical properties of whole fibrin clots.  \r\n\r\nThis project is a preliminary feasibility study on the use of a gross  model based on continuum mechanics to qualitatively model and simulate  the behavior of individual fibrin fibers, for better understanding of  their mechanical properties.  The underlying theme of proposed research  is design of novel computational models, simulation methods and software  systems based on the \"multi-scale\" framework, i.e. describing geometry,  numerics, and physical simulation across different scales.  Given the high complexity of molecular structures at the nanoscale,  this approach could potentially offer a robust and efficient solution that  scales up to large-sized problems and perhaps adequately models the mutual interaction among multiple nano-entities in complex physical or biological  systems. \r\n\r\nTo ensure the correctness of our proposed models and simulation methods, we will test and verify our approaches by comparing the simulation results with experimental data.  This will provide timely feedback and allow  rapid modification of our proposed models and simulation methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
