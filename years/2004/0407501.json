 "awd_abstract_narration": "UTTC has a regional service area and plays a prominent role in professional \r\ndevelopment for ND and the BIA. UT-PASS proposes to create a STEM student support system starting \r\nwith a Summer Pathways Institute (SPI) a month-long intensive STEM student skill-building program, a \r\nTribal Environmental Science AAS, Action Research throughout the STEM courses, and improvement in \r\nUTTC.s STEM faculty.s content knowledge and teaching practices. This grant integrates the Peer Led \r\nTeam Learning process into STEM instruction. Integration is achieved by professional development and \r\nassistance from the PLTL Facilitator. Andragogical practices encompass state-of-the-art math, science, \r\nand technology instruction and adult learning concepts. UT-PASS faculty work hand in hand with STEM \r\nstudents and general education instructors to provide enhanced STEM courses at UTTC. Peer teaching \r\nand mentoring are fundamental to this application. Teachers will be trained and then train other \r\nteachers.in pyramidal manner. UT-PASS employs the expertise of regional research institution faculty to \r\nsupport and mentor STEM faculty. Classroom resources including probeware, software, computers and \r\nprinters will be purchased by the grant. \r\n \r\nUT-PASS proposes to educate the whole person employing intensive year-round student support for \r\nSTEM students beginning with the SPI. Additionally, the emphasis on research affords the UT-PASS \r\nstudents ample opportunity to actively research issues important to them or their home reservations. \r\nIntensive and long-term staff development assures UTTC STEM faculty has access to adult learning \r\nprinciples, content knowledge and teaching methodologies. This staff development and student support \r\nsystem ensures that UT-PASS students successfully complete the Tribal Environmental Science or other \r\nSTEM degree, and either matriculates into a four-year degree program or are hired in the field of \r\nenvironmental studies.",
