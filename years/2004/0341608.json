The causes of multiple steady states that occur in non-equilibrium reactive distillation and the location of the singularities that cause these multiple steady-states will be determined.  Non-equilibrium reactive distillation line maps that can be used for design/synthesis in the limit of reaction equilibrium will be developed.  The effects of kinetics on feasible splits will be determined by distinguishing between a rectifying and a stripping cascade and identifying the fixed points of the corresponding equations. Several optimization strategies will be pursued.  The number of trays, feed tray locations, holdup per tray, reflux and boilup, and the condenser and reboiler duties for both non-equilibrium non-reactive and non-equilibrium reactive separation processes will be optimized.  Two optimization strategies used will be:  solution of mixed integer nonlinear optimization formulations using genetic algorithms and solution through standard local branch and bound algorithms such as Generalized Benders Decomposition.  Generation of Pareto optimal solutions through multi-objective optimization formulations will also be considered. All the analysis and algorithmic/numerical procedures developed will be tested on real industrial problems. The control aspect involves the development of nonlinear multi-variable control strategies for non-equilibrium reactive separation processes. Controllers based on reduced order and Volterra series representations will be developed and their performance will be tested through rigorous dynamic studies.  In terms of the broader impacts, both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the project.  New courses in distillation design will be introduced.  If successful, this work may lead to general methodologies for dealing with a class of problems encountered in industrial separations.\r\n",
