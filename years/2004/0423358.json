 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe focus of this combined experimental and theoretical research effort is to explore, demonstrate, and quantitatively model a new approach for creating coatings consisting of nanopillars that are built of multiple diverse materials combinations. Our proposed approach builds on a previously developed glancing angle deposition (GLAD) technique, which is based on local atomic shadowing effects from self-organized surface mound structures during line-of-sight vapor phase deposition. The key novelty of this project is to expand GLAD to simultaneous deposition from multiple sources from opposite sides (SO-GLAD). The resulting layers will contain nanopillars and/or nanosprings that consist of multiple materials, stacked both vertically and horizontally, with unique new electro-mechanical, optical, and catalytic functionalities.  The program will synergistically employ both experimental layer growth and atomistic computer simulations in order to assess and quantify the convoluted effects of surface diffusion, surface morphological evolution, and atomic shadowing mechanisms. In addition to the fundamental growth studies, we will explore applications for the SO-GLAD technique by creating (a) in-plane nanolayered hard-coatings based on TiN/CrN two-component nanocolumns.  (b) smart coatings with nanopillars that simultaneously act as sensors and actuators.  (c) multi-component nanospring sensor arrays with unique damping and high-sensitivity.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a new method to create coatings that have the potential to dramatically enhance the performance of a wide range of technological parts. These new coatings are assembled using beams of various atoms. Potential applications include hard wear-resistant coatings for dry high-speed cutting and fuel-efficient jet-engines, smart coatings for self-regulatory chemical nanoreactors in future drug discovery or medical analysis apparatus, and nanospring sensor arrays with unique damping and high-sensitivity pressure response for robotic applications. Two graduate students and six undergraduates will work in this interdisciplinary collaborative research program, which will link to young principle investigators with complementary experimental (Gall) and theoretical (Huang) expertise. The program will provide a mind-broadening experience for undergraduate and graduate students in both research groups. An integral part of the proposed effort is the development of a classroom thin film growth simulator which will illustrate the atomistic processes that govern layer deposition and will be integrated in a core-engineering course, impacting over 300 students per year.\r\n \r\n",
