 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  This project is developing a resource GUide to Research for Undergraduates (Web-GURU) intended to facilitate faculty mentoring of undergraduates participating in undergraduate research (UR) experiences in the field of chemistry.   The project personnel are developing and field testing a set of web-based modules unique to the UR experience that are used by undergraduates for self-study or by faculty mentors either in formal classroom settings or research group meetings.   The project benefits all parties involved in the undergraduate research enterprise and should improve the quality of student undergraduate research experiences.  The project is expected to positively impact the training of undergraduates and inform the practice of UR widely.  The intellectual merit of this project includes the development and investigation of the value of a web-based mentoring resource for undergraduate students involved in undergraduate research experiences in chemistry.  The broader impacts of this work include (1) improving the education of future STEM faculty, teachers, and practitioners through the creation of a knowledge database of materials and methods that enhance student learning during the undergraduate research experience; (2) sparking complementary efforts by other UR practitioners; and (3) encouraging the participation of new faculty to develop UR efforts and thus expanding the practice of UR even more widely.  \r\n",
