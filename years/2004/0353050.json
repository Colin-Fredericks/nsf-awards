 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU is an eight-week summer research experience in mathematics to be held at SUNY Potsdam for nine undergraduates mathematics students during summers.  The areas of the research are Group Theory, Algebra, Quantum Walks on the Graphs, and Graphs.\r\n\r\nSUNY Potsdam is widely known for its undergraduate mathematics program founded by Clarence Stephens, and Clarkson University has an international reputation in scientific research.  Each institution has its own special attraction, and together they create for students a unique atmosphere of learning and research.  In addition to providing a superb intellectual atmosphere, Potsdam is a quiet and peaceful village, located within two hours of Lake Placid, Thousand Islands, Ottawa and Montreal.  Summer weather is generally cool and comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe proposed summer program is built on the policy that the students will be colleagues with the faculty advisors and will be treated as such as they jointly pursue unanswered mathematical questions. The approach will be one of collaboration and, therefore, will not carry the negative overtone inherent in grading/evaluation approaches.  Faculty advisors and student leaders provide guidance, structure and leadership.\r\n",
