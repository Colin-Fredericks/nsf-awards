Two areas of collaboration will be developed in the planning phase: 1) Dr. Solomon Bililign (NCAT) and Dr. Mulugeta Bekele (AAU), a theoretical physicist with expertise in theoretical statistical physics, will study the feasibility of using statistical models to study the photofragmentation dynamics of transition metal organometallics in order to help understand the experimental studies of chemical reaction that take place within nanoclusters following multiphoton ionization and dissociation of transition metal carbonyls. The planning visit will allow reciprocal visits to the labs of both physicists. (2) Also supported by this award are reciprocal visits by U.S. and Ethiopian geophysicists who will develop plans for providing international research experiences for NCAT students to work with U.S. and Ethiopian scientists collaborating on geophysical research in Ethiopia. With the support of other NSF awards, the environmental geophysics degree track is under development at NCAT; the Departments of Geophysics and Physics at AAU have a long history of research experience and strong international collaborations in geosciences. Furthermore, Ethiopia provides a natural laboratory for a number of interesting geophysical phenomena. This planning visit should lay the groundwork for building a strong research and education collaboration that will provide NCAT students the opportunity to participate in international field research. \r\n\r\nIn an era of globalization where actions anywhere will affect and influence others elsewhere, our students will benefit significantly from conducting science in other countries, experiencing other cultures, and contributing to the global economy. The collaborations in this planning request will help in this effort. This project can also have a significant impact on the participation of African-American students in geoscience education and research in the U. S. and in Ethiopia.  We expect that providing strong international research experiences for NCAT students will strengthen their geoscience course study, providing first-hand field experience and research skills in geosciences, and enhancing their ability and likelihood of pursuing academic and/or industry careers in geosciences. This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Chemistry.\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n",
