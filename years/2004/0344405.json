 "awd_abstract_narration": "Loss of ancestral traits and trait complexes is a pervasive aspect\r\nof the evolutionary process, but its causes, mechanisms, consequences, and\r\nthe possibility of restoration of the lost traits are still poorly\r\nunderstood.  The current project aims to explore the patterns of repeated\r\ndecay and loss of a stereotyped maternal behavior in the North American\r\nleafhopper genus Cuerna as a model of the regressive evolution of a complex\r\nbiological function at the species level.  In some of the 31 known species\r\nof the genus, females display an ancestral egg-powdering behavior, coating\r\nthe egg nests with a layer of specialized Malpighian tubule products and\r\ndisplaying a suite of corresponding physiological and structural\r\nmodifications, while in other species no such behavior is observed.\r\nPreliminary phylogenetic analyses suggested that egg-powdering has been\r\nlost or lost-and-restored within the genus multiple times.  In the three\r\nyears of the project the investigators will collect detailed comparative\r\ndata on the egg-laying behavior and associated specializations of the\r\nexternal morphology and the Malpighian tubules for every species of Cuerna.\r\nThen, they will analyze these in the context of a detailed DNA-based\r\nphylogeny of the genus to address the following questions:  Did the changes\r\nof particular traits proceed as quantum leaps or gradually?  Do\r\nmorphological, behavioral, and physiological traits display similar\r\nevolutionary plasticity?  Did they change in a certain order?  Did any\r\nrestorations of lost egg-powdering occur in the evolution of Cuerna?  What\r\nwere the most likely causes of the losses?  The study will also result in a\r\ntaxonomic revision of the genus, which currently contains a number of\r\npoorly defined species.\r\n\r\nThe study will contribute to management of economically important\r\nspecies of Cuerna by providing identification aids, as well as behavioral\r\nand physiological data for improved integrated pest management.  An\r\ninteractive key to species of Cuerna, complete with bionomical and\r\ndistribution data, will be served on-line.  The project will also provide\r\ntraining for a graduate student in the systematics, molecular\r\nphylogenetics, and evolutionary biology of insects.\r\n\r\n",
