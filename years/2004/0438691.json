The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-04556).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners include Kansas State University (Lead Institution), Advanced Manufacturing Institute (AMI), Agricultural Innovation Center (AIC), Bioprocessing & Industrial Value-Added Program (BIVAP), Kansas Department of Commerce (KDOC), Kansas Entrepreneurs & Small to Medium-Sized Manufacturers, Kansas Technology Enterprise Corporation (KTEC), Lawrence Regional Technology Center (LRTC), Mid-America Commercialization Corporation (MACC), and Value-Added Business Development Program (VABDP).\r\n\r\nThe primary objectives are: 1) create a structured process to identify university\r\nintellectual property that is ripe for development; 2) create the infrastructure needed to transform\r\nknowledge, inventions, and discoveries in bioscience-related research and applications into viable\r\nproducts; 3) market this Early Stage Technology Development (ESTD) service throughout the university\r\nand state; and 4) prepare a future workforce to develop new bioscience products and technologies.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\nThis activity will provide general economic well being in Kansas. It will increase the transfer of technologies to Kansas companies; stimulate the formation of and assist the development of technology-based businesses in Kansas; increase new products brought to market; and provide access to an engineering resource that significantly accelerates the development and hardening of new bioscience-based products, processes, and technologies in Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project is to simultaneously develop and formalize a process to accelerate the\r\ncommercial development of bioscience products and technologies and provide meaningful ESTD\r\nexperience to Kansas's future technology engineers and entrepreneurs.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the activity concentrate on the creation of wealth and high-\r\npaying jobs for the citizens of Kansas. In addition, creating a model process that benefits both the\r\ntechnology creator/inventor and the recipient will stimulate transformation of intellectual property created\r\nin both company and university laboratories into commercial products. Both undergraduate and graduate\r\nstudents will be involved and educated about commercialization activities and thus, Kansas future\r\ntechnology entrepreneurs will learn to define and conduct successful bioscience ESTD projects.\r\n",
