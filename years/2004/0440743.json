 "awd_abstract_narration": "The power of the national information infrastructure has expanded\r\nenormously over the last decade.  Commercial Internet service and\r\ngovernment-sponsored advanced networks for research and education\r\nsupport a range of national priorities.  Unfortunately, rapid\r\ndevelopment and deployment of robust, adaptive network software is\r\nhampered by a fundamental obstacle: prototype systems are difficult to\r\nevaluate due to scale and complexity of their host environment---the\r\nInternet.\r\n \r\nThis proposal seeks to remove this obstacle by constructing a software\r\nenvironment for evaluating prototype network software systems under\r\nrealistic, controlled, repeatable conditions through scalable Internet\r\nemulation.  The proposed system, ModelNet, emulates a wide-area\r\nnetwork on a high-speed cluster, enabling researchers to deploy\r\nunmodified software prototypes in a configurable Internet-like\r\nenvironment and subject them to faults and varying network conditions.\r\n \r\nThis research will first investigate techniques for scaling network\r\nemulation to thousands of unmodified applications with aggregate\r\ncommunication bandwidth of over 10 Gb/s.  Second, it will enable the\r\ncommunity to leverage large-scale network emulation as a primary\r\ntechnique for rapidly developing and evaluating next-generation\r\nInternet services and applications.  Finally, the research will seek\r\nfundamental improvements in network service robustness and performance\r\nby providing a controlled environment for subjecting network services\r\nto a range of realistic deployment scenarios.\r\n",
