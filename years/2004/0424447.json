 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will study the relationship between low-dose organophosphate pesticide exposure and cortisol levels in humans by examining this relationship in a Mexican immigrant farmworker community located in the Lower Yakima Valley of Washington State. No investigation has yet studied pesticide exposure from both a biological and cultural perspective. This project will address this gap in the literature, and will play an important role in the increased understanding of pesticide exposure in the US farmworker population.\r\n\r\nThis project will use the strengths of two major fields - anthropology and environmental health - to investigate the relationship between cultural beliefs and practices, pesticide exposure, and cortisol levels. This study will examine this association in an area where agricultural workers are routinely exposed to high and low levels of organophosphate pesticides.  The aims of this investigation are to:\r\n \r\n1.\tIdentify cultural beliefs and practices related to organophosphate pesticide exposure among Mexican immigrant farmworkers using open-ended, in-depth interviews; \r\n2.\tAssess the role of cultural beliefs and practices on organophosphate pesticide protective behavior (ex. use of protective gear) by comparing themes from in-depth interviews to questionnaire survey responses about personal protective behavior.\r\n3.\tAssess the role of cultural beliefs and practices on organophosphate pesticide exposure by comparing themes from in-depth interviews to measured metabolites of organophosphate pesticides in urine.\r\n4.\tAssess the association between organophosphate pesticide exposure and cortisol levels by comparing metabolites of organophosphate pesticides in urine to measured salivary cortisol levels in spray and non-spray seasons.\r\n5.\tIdentify and measure levels of psychological stress among Mexican immigrant farmworkers by using a culturally appropriate, investigator-developed instrument examining Mexican immigrant farmworker stress.  This scale will control for the effect of psychological stress on cortisol levels, and has been tested and validated by the investigator in the Lower Yakima Valley community.\r\n\r\nThis study will contribute to the larger scientific community by increasing participation of underrepresented groups involving ethnic minorities as both participant and investigator. This research will also increase the study of cultural behaviors, perceptions and practices in the health and medical sciences, which will increase overall understanding of how culture and behavior influence health.  \r\n",
