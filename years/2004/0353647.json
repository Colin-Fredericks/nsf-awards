 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Undergraduate Research Training program in Marine Biomedical Science will be held at the Whitney Laboratory, University of Florida, located in St. Augustine, Florida.  From its inception in 1986, the Whitney Laboratory REU program has had two major aims: (1) to provide undergraduates with a realistic and professional research experience that would reinforce their interest in basic research or motivate them to consider basic research as a career option and, (2) to make students aware of the value of marine animals and other comparative model systems in fundamental biological research.\r\nInterns work toward independence on a project selected from topics in neurobiology, molecular biology, cellular biology, biochemistry, genomics, and nanotechnology.  Generally, students work with marine model systems such as horseshoe crabs, lobsters, mollusks, cnidarians and non-marine invertebrates.  Projects are sculpted from ongoing research efforts yet are distinct. Other activities include field trips to three distinct Florida marine environments, lectures that highlight the research efforts at the Laboratory, weekly discussions on ethical scientific conduct and group meetings with the directors from various University of Florida graduate school programs.  Interns attend workshops on collection of marine organisms, handling and disposal of hazardous materials, preparation and presentation of material for seminars and poster sessions, scientific writing for publications, and notebook maintenance.  Interns are also encouraged to work with local area school children in marine science enrichment programs.\r\nThe program will accept up to 10 students for the annual summer session. Students are recruited from colleges and universities throughout the United States and territories, with a special emphasis on schools traditionally populated by under represented minorities and from schools that lack graduate programs in the biological sciences.  For more information, contact: William R. Buzzi at 904.461.4011 or wrb@whitney.ufl.edu; or visit: http://www.whitney.ufl.edu/reu/undergra.htm.\r\n",
