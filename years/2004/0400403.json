 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Community Science Workshops:  Beginning a National Movement\" is an extension of a successful, NSF-funded project that created a network of community science centers in California.  The San Francisco State University will now take this successful venture to a national level by working with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and Quality Education for Minorities (QEM) to establish a new Community Science Workshop (CSW) 8-10 in underserved communities over the next four years.  Once sites are selected, CSW directors participate in an intensive two-week training program.  This is followed by visits by site mentors, and ongoing support through the WWW and other media, which contributes to the establishment and eventual sustainability of the centers.  Each site partners with larger, established museums and science centers locally to gain much needed assistance with exhibits and education programs.  Community Science Workshops contain permanent exhibit space, a workshop area for student projects and classroom/storage space.  They serve a variety of audiences through after school, family, school and summer science programs.  Potential locations include Arizona, Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, New York, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and the District of Columbia.",
