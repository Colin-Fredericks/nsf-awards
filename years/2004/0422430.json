 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the SciMath scholarship program is to attract academically talented but financially disadvantaged students to the fields of computer science, engineering, or mathematics (CSEM).  The objectives of the SciMath scholarship project are to: \r\n(a) increase the number of talented, low-income students enrolled and retained in CSEM degree programs, \r\n(b) increase the participation of underrepresented and nontraditional populations, \r\n(c) promote student academic success, and \r\n(d) support transition to employment or transfer to four-year institutions. \r\n\r\nThe project focuses on early identification of low-income students with an interest in and aptitude for careers in CSEM fields. Students who are admitted to the program receive financial support and are provided with support services such as needs assessment, academic and career planning, counseling, tutoring, and mentoring. Participants seeking employment receive help in resume writing, interview skills, and industry contacts. Participants planning to transfer to a baccalaureate institution receive help in preparing forms and essays and choosing appropriate institutions. The project coordinates efforts from existing programs and agencies on campus to provide support for SciMath scholars. Faculty members from CSEMS departments serve as advisors to students in the SciMath scholarship program. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The SciMath scholarship program increases the number of two-year graduates in CSEM disciplines by providing financial support for students. High-technology industries in close proximity to the college benefit from the skilled workers whose education was subsidized by the scholarships. The scholarship program provide an increased pool of diverse candidates for transfer institutions that actively recruit students for CSEM baccalaureate degree programs.   \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Academic success of CSEM students is being improved by supporting skills development through tutoring, mentoring, and counseling. SciMath students are required to commit to completing an associate degree before subsequent transfer or employment. The scholarship program requires students to focus on academic and career goals and provides the support by using both campus and community resources. Collaborations with industrial partners and four-year institutions enrich and strengthen the preparation of students in CSEM disciplines. \r\n\r\n",
