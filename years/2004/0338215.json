 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: GK-12: EdGrid Graduate Teaching Fellows Program (Track 2)\r\nInstitution: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\r\nPrincipal Investigator/Co-Principal Investigators: Deanna Raineri (PI)/Bertram Bruce, Eric\r\nJakobsson, Richard Braatz, Vernon Burton (Co-PIs)\r\nNumber of Fellows per Year: 8 to 10 Graduate; 6 Undergraduate\r\nSchool District Partners: Champaign Centennial High School; Danville High School;\r\nHinsdale, District 86; Technology Center of DuPage; Urbana High School, Home Hi (all girls)\r\nHigh School, Okaw Valley High School, Jefferson, Brownstown and Cerro Gordo Elementary\r\nTarget Audience: Middle and High School\r\nSetting: Rural, Urban and Suburban\r\nNSF-Supported Disciplines Involved: Animal Science, Anthropology, Atmospheric Sciences,\r\nBiology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geography, Mathematics, Physics, Social Sciences\r\n\r\nNarrative:  The Fellows collaborate with campus faculty and participating K-12 teachers to\r\nintegrate computer-based modeling, scientific visualization and informatics in K-12 science\r\nand mathematics education. Modeling and visualization tools are developed that engage\r\nstudents and help them to \"learn how to do science, learn the nature of science and learn\r\nscience content\". The GK-12 EdGrid project provides professional development opportunities\r\nfor K-12 science and mathematics teachers to improve K-12 science teaching and learning.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. The GK-12 EdGrid Program draws on significant higher education\r\ninstitutional resources (both human and technology-related) in the STEM disciplines to create a\r\nframework for sustainable K-12 education outreach. These efforts contribute to advancing\r\nknowledge and understanding of the role of: a) higher education STEM discipline faculty and students in the professional development of K-12 teachers; b) STEM discipline faculty and students in improving learning of K-12 students through the engagement of innovative technologies that foster integration of research and education; c) educational collaboratories in K-12 settings; c) graduate students in building sustainable university-school partnerships; d) graduate students in promoting K-12 student interest in higher education STEM disciplines (by acting as role models); e) university-school partnerships in improving pedagogical practices in university education through the engagement of higher education faculty and graduate students with experienced K-12 teachers.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. The GK-12 project utilizes EdGrid's web portal, the Inquiry Page\r\n(http://www.inquiry.uiuc.edu), national conferences and various publications to disseminate\r\nthe GK-12 experiences, modeling and visualization tools and curriculum materials to support\r\nteachers nation-wide. By partnering with other on-campus programs serving primarily\r\nunderrepresented student groups, the GK-12 EdGrid program actively seeks and recruits\r\ngraduates and advanced undergraduates from underrepresented populations. The GK-12 EdGrid program also broadens its already interdisciplinary focus by actively recruiting graduate students\r\nfrom the social sciences. The addition of social science disciplines allows for more\r\ncoverage of the K-12 curriculum and adds yet another varied vision that contributes to the\r\nrichness of the UIUC GK-12 program.  The GK-12 EdGrid program leaders are working with institutional and school administrators to make GK-12 activities an integral and sustainable part of the UIUC graduate training experience.\r\n\r\nOutcomes from Track 1.  This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n",
