 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Center for Engineering and Technology Education (NCETE) links technology educators with engineering educators in a symbiotic alliance to build capacity for research; nurture a cadre of talented, diverse leaders in engineering and technology education; and infuse engineering content, design and analytical skills into K-12 schools.  The Center includes partners with strengths in engineering and in technology education, including four land-grant university research partners (Utah State University, the University of Minnesota, the University of Illinois and the University of Georgia), five technology teacher education partners (Brigham Young University, California State University at Los Angeles, University of Wisconsin - Stout, Illinois State University and North Carolina A&T State University) and fifteen K-12 school district partners.  NCETE vertical linkages spanning the educational levels from K-Ph.D. in regional teams are located in the West, the Upper Midwest, the Central Midwest and the Southeast.  Regional teams facilitate collaborative research, professional development, capacity building and dissemination of research findings and model practices.  NCETE also facilitates horizontal collaboration among Ph.D. programs, teacher education programs and K-12 partners to build capacity and to share effective strategies and practices. \r\n\r\nNCETE is building a community of informed and able researchers and leaders to improve the national capability to conduct research in emerging engineering and technology education areas.  In addition, center research partners are creating a body of research that improves our understanding of the learning and teaching engineering and technology subjects, and evaluates the benefits and shortcomings of engineering content for student learning in diverse K-12 settings.  These findings are intended to inform decisions about curriculum and assessment, influence the development of engineering and technology education and provide data about curriculum implementation in schools.  Technology teacher education partners are preparing technology education teachers at the baccalaureate and master's levels and conducting professional development for practicing K-12 teachers to prepare them to infuse engineering content into the curriculum.  \r\n",
