 "awd_abstract_narration": "We intend to study three topics in combinatorics which are related to\r\ntheoretical computer science. We will study the diameter problem for\r\ngraphs of polytopes aiming at a polynomial upper bound, and also try to\r\nfind versions of the simplex algorithm with sub-exponential worst case\r\nbehavior. We will study Boolean functions, their Fourier transform and how\r\nit relates to questions in probability and complexity. We will also try to\r\nfind general methods to relate the solution of a positive integer\r\nprogramming problem and its linear programming relaxation.\r\n\r\nCombinatorics have now become the central mathematical discipline in\r\ntheoretical computer science (and various applied areas of computer\r\nscience as well). The role of combinatorics in computer science today is\r\nquite similar to the role of logic in the early days of computation.\r\nProblems from theoretical computer science enriched and enforced\r\ncombinatorial thinking and areas which were regarded as having clear \r\nintellectual merit have gained surprising real-life applications.  Linear\r\nprogramming and the simplex algorithm are among the most important\r\napplications of computers and in our earlier work as well as the planned\r\nresearch. We intend to study fundamental questions concerning linear\r\nprogramming. Another area of our research, the Fourier analysis of Boolean\r\nfunctions is a relatively new area which we helped to develop in the past.  \r\nIn view of the importance of Fourier analysis in other areas we should not\r\nhave been surprised to see its recent applications in combinatorics and\r\ncomplexity theory and  we intend to explore further connections.\r\n",
