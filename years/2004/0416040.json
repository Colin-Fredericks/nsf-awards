 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Carol Bessel of Villanova University is investigating the catalytic growth of highly structured, crystalline carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The project aims to correlate the structure and physical p roperties of Cu, Fe and Ni based-catalysts used in forming CNFs with the carbon structures (e.g, platelet versus ribbon) produced.  X-ray and electron microscope techniques are being used to characterize prepared catalyst.  Additionally, the composition of Fe and FeNi catalyst is being explored with 57-Fe Mossbauer spectroscopy through collaboration with the Department of Physics at Villanova University.  The project is providing fundamental understanding of catalyst systems needed to prepare CNFs with tailored properties.  Application of the carbon materials as a support material for metal catalysts is also being investigated. \r\n\r\nThe physical and chemical methods being applied to study the properties and growth mechanisms of carbon nanofibers are enabling new insights into factors that affect structure and reactivity in nanometer-scale materials that have application in areas such as catalysis, medicine, sensing and fuel cell systems.  This undergraduate research project is also integrating nanotechnology into classroom activities to enhance and broaden interest in science.  \r\n",
