 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will address the catalytic production of alkanes from biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons utilizing a newly discovered low-temperature aqueous-phase reforming process.  This new process provides a route for generation of alkanes from renewable biomass resources.  The core of the innovation is the production of hydrocarbon-rich fuel-gas by reactions of oxygenated hydrocarbons with liquid water at low temperatures (near 200 C).  The main advantages include: (1) generation of alkanes without the need to volatilize water, which represents a major energy saving, and (2) operation at temperatures where the water-gas shift reaction is favorable, making it possible to generate high-quality fuel-gas with low amounts of CO in a single chemical reactor. The process provides a strategy for delivering a biorenewable fuel for modern, highly efficient internal combustion engines (ICEs).  The combination of renewable alkanes with efficient ICEs provides a promising method for sustainable generation of mechanical and electrical energy that is green house gas neutral, since the CO2 emitted from the reforming process is consumed by the next year's growth of biomass. The potential technological impact of this new process for the production of alkanes is substantial, leading to a considerable decrease in the dependence of the US economy on imported fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nThe best catalysts identified at present for the generation of alkanes by the aqueous-phase reforming process are based on platinum, which is an expensive metal.  Further research will be conducted to develop a new generation of catalysts to provide cost-effective methods to generate alkanes using the aqueous-phase reforming process to convert reactants extracted from biomass streams. Additives will be investigated to improve the performance, cost, and efficiency of Pt-based catalysts. The reaction conditions (such as temperature, pressure, feed concentrations, solution pH) will also be varied to control the product distribution, and catalytic performance with respect to long times on-steam will be determined. The investigations will rely on: (1) high throughput screening of catalyst candidates, (2) detailed catalytic reaction kinetics studies of the most promising catalyst candidates, (3) spectroscopic and characterization studies of the most promising catalytic materials, and (4) systematic first-principles studies for C-C, C-O, C-H, and O-H bond activation on transition metals. \r\n",
