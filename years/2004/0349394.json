 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Prairie Analysis Seminar, a joint project of Kansas State University and the University of Kansas, will be held in October 2003.  \r\nThis follows two successful meetings in October 2001 and 2002. \r\nFurther meetings in October of the coming years are planned. \r\nThe topic within the field of analysis varies from year to year;this year's theme is ``p-harmonic functions\". The conference brings together three leading researchers, Professors Tadeusz Iwaniec of Syracuse University, John Lewis of the University of Kentucky, and Juan Manfredi of the University of Pittsburgh to give the main lectures.  Professor \r\nIwaniec's work on quasiharmonic fields of unbounded distortion has \r\napplications to non-uniformly elliptic PDEs including non-isotropic PDEs.  Professor Lewis has recently coauthored the successful resolution of the long-standing Kato-square root problem, and his past work has included nonlinear potential theory and the study of parabolic PDEs.  Professor Manfredi's recent work is on the infinity-Laplacian and past work includes contributions to the study of the p-Laplace equation.  We expect the meeting to bring together these and other experts in the \r\nfield as well as newcomers.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are no standing conferences in analysis and only rarely other conferences in this region in the fall.  The organizers have structured the conference in such a way so as to keep the costs for the host university and participants to a minimum.  This allows a wide range of mathematicians to attend--mathematicians at all stages in their careers and from a variety of institutions.  In particular, we encourage mathematicians in the early stages of their careers to attend and give a contributed talk, giving them an opportunity to show their work and increase their visibility in the mathematical community.  The conference has historically attracted a number of researchers from small universities and colleges throughout the region.  This has fostered fruitful interaction among these institutions, and between these institutions and ours. It is the intent of the organizers to continue to work to attract\r\nthese researchers.  It is the intention of the main speakers to publish a proceedings of the conference.  Dissemination of this knowledge will be of use to those in the field and related areas.  It is to be emphasized that in all announcements of the meeting, and through their professional contacts,  the organizers encourage and\r\nparticularly support participation of mathematicians early in their career and of traditionally underrepresented minorities.",
