 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Federation of American Biological Societies of Experimental Biology (FASEB) conference entitled Protein Lipidation, Signaling and Membrane Domains will be held July 24-29, 2004 at Tucson, AZ. This meeting will highlight exciting recent progress, and provide a forum for critical discussions, concerning lipid-modified proteins and membrane microdomains and their roles in processes including signal transduction, trafficking and sorting of membrane molecules. The fields of lipid-modified proteins and membrane domains (\"rafts\", caveolae and other specialized membrane microenvironments) represent distinct areas of research that are nonetheless closely intertwined and synergistic. This is the case in part because many lipidated proteins involved in signaling, trafficking and other processes are associated with specialized membrane domains, and because the lipid modifications of such proteins often play important roles in determining their targeting to specific membrane domains as well as specific membranes.\r\n\r\nThe meeting will be organized around three main themes. First, it will provide a very timely forum for the exchange and critical evaluation of information about the nature of membrane microdomains in living cells and their roles in functions such as cell signaling and membrane trafficking. Second, it will feature new developments in understanding the enzymology of protein lipidation, including recent successes in characterizing the enzymes involved in protein thioacylation, and in coupling of GPI-\"anchor\" groups to proteins, using combined genetic and biochemical approaches. Third, the conference will highlight recent progress in understanding the biological functions of protein-coupled lipid groups and the recognition of lipid-modified protein domains by regulatory, effector and other proteins.   With its unique dual focus on the complementary areas of lipid-modified proteins and membrane microdomains, this meeting will promote important sharing of information and foster collaborations between researchers from diverse fields.  An important function of the meeting will be to allow junior researchers (including graduate students and postdoctoral fellows) to interact with established leaders in these fields, an objective that is promoted by the small size of the conference (maximum 200 participants) and the requirement that speakers remain present on-site throughout the course of the meeting.  Advertising strategies and criteria for selection of participants will be chosen to promote participation of junior researchers, women and underrepresented minority groups. To promote this objective further, roughly 12 talks will be presented by speakers chosen from submitted abstracts, with preference to be given to individuals from the groups noted above.\r\n",
