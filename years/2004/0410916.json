 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discipline: Civil Engineering (54)\r\n\r\nThis project is enhancing student learning through effective teaching techniques that include hands-on and real world activities that are thoughtfully integrated into courses. The goal is to improve student interest and learning of groundwater topics. Project tasks include: modify and adapt hands-on physical models and real world active learning activities, integrate and implement the activities into Introduction to Environmental Engineering and Laboratory, and assess and evaluate the effectiveness of the activities in enhancing student learning. Models and activities were adapted from Project WET, AEESP laboratory manual, and EPA material, while implementation is based on the ASCE ExCEEd teaching model. Project results are being disseminated through presentations at conferences and workshops, project webpage, and publications in engineering education journals. The intellectual merit of this project is the application of proven effective teaching techniques to environmental engineering courses and implementation of physical models and activities based on these techniques. The broader impacts include: improved student learning and enthusiasm for environmental engineering; increased participation of women and minorities pursuing environmental engineering; improved awareness of the interdisciplinary nature relationship between civil and environmental engineering projects; and potential application of adapted models and activities to other courses and outreach activities.",
