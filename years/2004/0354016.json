 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Ten students per year will be recruited from throughout the U.S. for a unique twelve-week summer experience at a U.S. federal laboratory. This program leverages the resources of two federal agencies (NSF and NIST) to foster an undergraduate research program that gives students access to state-of-the-art equipment and world-recognized researchers. Student participants will engage in cutting-edge research in topics such as intelligent systems, manufacturing metrology, precision engineering, and manufacturing systems integration. The program will serve to encourage undergraduates to pursue advanced degrees in engineering and thus impact the nations need to increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents engaged in research-related careers. It is anticipated that this REU Site will have a Broader Impact on the nations need for increased participation of citizens and permanent residents from demographic groups traditionally underrepresented in the science and engineering research enterprise.",
