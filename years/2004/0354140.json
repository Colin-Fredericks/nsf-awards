 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin-Whitewater will host 12 participants each summer in a 10-week REU program in one of two areas of Biological Research: Ecology and Evolutionary Biology or Molecular, Cell and Neurobiology.  Our program is designed to provide hands-on research opportunities for teams of participants consisting of high school teachers, undergraduates, and select high school students.  Applicants will be recruited from pools of traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences.  Recruitment will be based on interest in the work in one or more of the research labs, career goals, and academic achievement.  Application selection will be structured to ensure diversity while emphasizing opportunities for in-service and pre-service educators.  The 10 faculty who will serve as mentors in the program have active research programs including evolutionary aspects of mate choice, molecular analysis of plant pathogens, and mechanisms of brain reward systems.  Participants in the REU program will be able to: 1) distinguish between investigative science and dated accepted facts called \"science knowledge\", 2) demonstrate skilled laboratory/field work, 3) independently progress from a research problem to developing a research question, form a hypothesis, and test the hypothesis, 4) develop an appreciation of investigative science and methods, 5) provide an articulate discussion of ethics, 6) organize the laboratory bench/site for research, 7) deliver an effective oral presentation, and 8) conduct data analysis and present results as a scientific poster.  The University of Wisconsin-Whitewater is a campus of 11,000 students in a small community in rural southeastern Wisconsin with a reputation for an active environment for undergraduate research.  For further information and application materials, please contact Dr. Mike Woller at wollerm@uww.edu or 262-472-5137, or visit http://academics.uww.edu/biology/TERP.html.",
