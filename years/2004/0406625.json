 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract, 0406625\r\n\r\nThe Central States Section of the Combustion Institute (CSSCI) supports the broader objectives of The Combustion Institute with a primary focus on facilitating discovery and application of combustion science. CSSCI holds yearly meetings to promote the exchange of new ideas among combustion researchers in the Central United States, i.e., within the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Wisconsin. \r\n\r\nTopics on the program include fundamental aspects of flames, chemical kinetics, and pollutant formation as well as applications in engines and turbines.  The meeting will also consider research issues in fire control and combustion-based synthesis of materials as well as experimental diagnostic techniques and computational methods.  \r\n \r\nThis award provides partial support for students of the region to participate in a meeting of the CSSCI from March 21-23, 2004, at the University of Texas at Austin and provides these students with the conference proceedings.   Students participating in such meetings not only gain technical insight from interacting with senior researchers but also develop a greater sense of community within their research area.   Further, the Central Section of the Combustion Institute has a strong industrial combustion community within it, and the ability for the students to interact with the industrial researchers aids the students in terms of career placement and in terms of better motivating their research. \r\n \r\nThe broader impact of promoting participation of students in scholarly workshops is that \r\ngraduate training  and  education take place beyond the university environment.    The interaction between students from different universities and between students and more senior researchers is an important part of the graduate learning experience. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
