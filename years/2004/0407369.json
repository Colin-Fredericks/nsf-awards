 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to the University of Arizona supports Dr. Eniko T. Enikov, Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, and Dr. Joel Cuello, Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering  for their work to develop a set of undergraduate laboratory experiments that are focused on the nano-scale surface science of biosensors. BioMEMS and biosensors have generated significant interest because of their potential use in a wide spectrum of applications ranging from biotechnology and medical diagnostics to environmental monitoring and biological warfare. The key component of most biosensors is an artificial surface capable of recognizing a specific analyte molecule.  \r\n\r\nThis effort will expand the newly developed interdisciplinary undergraduate course \"Engineering Properties and Micro/Nano Technologies for Biological Systems\" through the development of five experiments in support of a lecture-based course on the nanoengineering of biologically active surfaces. Specifically, the experiments will focus on fabrication of micro-cantilever probes, self-assembly of organic monolayers (SAMs), micro-contact printing of SAMs, measurements of elastic properties of bio-films via nano-indentation, and measurement of the surface stress of self-assembled monolayers with micro-cantilever sensors.\r\n\r\nThe proposed laboratory development is part of a multi-departmental master plan for the creation of a college-wide undergraduate curriculum on micro- and nano-technologies addressing the needs not only of undergraduate engineering students but also of students from other sciences, such as biosciences, optics, and physics. It is being designed with the mission  of inspiring a broad spectrum of students to pursue scientific careers in the area of nanotechnology. \r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education announcement, NSF 03-044, category NUE and was jointly funded by the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems (CMS) and the Division of Bioengineering and Environmental Systems (BES) in the Directorate for Engineering (ENG) and the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO).\r\n",
