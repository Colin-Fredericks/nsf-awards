 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to Clarkson University supports Professors. Don H. Rasmussen and Ian Suni, Department of Chemical Engineering and Professor Brenton D. Faber, Department of Technical Communications for their work to develop hypermedia software, including text, graphics, animations, etc., for modular use in the area of Introduction to Nanomaterials Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\nThree modules will be created covering materials aspects of nanoparticles and strength of nanomaterials, as well as societal impacts of nanotechnology.  These modules will be employed for introducing nanotechnology concepts into an Introduction to Materials Science and Engineering course (ES 260) which will be taught in the spring and fall predominantly to sophomore engineering students.  These hypermedia software modules will also be accessible to other educators and researchers nationally and internationally via Internet dissemination, and their existence will be promoted through participation in professional society meetings and through indexing in science and engineering databases.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education (NSEE) announcement, NSF 03-444, category NUE and was jointly funded by the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems (CMS) and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) in the Directorate for Engineering (BIO).",
