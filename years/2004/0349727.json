 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop technology for joining metallic and ceramic components; this is a reactive joining process that uses reactive multilayer foils as local heat sources for melting solders.  These foils are a new class of nano-engineered materials, in which self-propagating exothermic reactions can be initiated at room temperature using a hot filament or laser.    By inserting a multilayer foil between two solder layers and two components, heat generated by the reaction in the foil melts the solder and consequently bonds the components.  This new method of soldering eliminates the need for a furnace or protective atmospheres and, with very localized heating, avoids thermal damage to the components.  The reactive bonding process is far more rapid than most competing technologies, and results in strong and cost-effective joints. The last and potentially most important benefit is the fact that joining with multilayer foils enables the use of lead free solders and therefore offers tremendous environmental benefits. \r\n \r\nThe broader impacts that could result from this project could be to microelectronic packaging facilities. \r\n",
