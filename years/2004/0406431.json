 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is dealing with statistical methods for large and complex data \r\nsets\r\ninvolving shape aspects. One example for a method relevant to this project\r\nis PRIM (Friedman and  Fisher, 1999), a popular data mining algorithm with\r\na wide range of possible applications. PRIM has been applied to serval real \r\nworld\r\nproblems and two modifications have recently been developed\r\n(Becker and Fahrmeir (2001) and LeBlanc et al. (2002)). Nevertheless,\r\nno theoretical foundation of the algorithm exists which might provide a deeper\r\nunderstanding of the algorithm. To provide such an analysis of PRIM and its \r\nmodifications\r\nis part of the proposed project. In fact, a preliminary analysis revealed a \r\nclose connections\r\nto much better understood methods based on minimum volume sets. This revelation\r\nalso shows the connection to \"shape statistics\". In another subproject the \r\ninvestigator\r\nwill develop a novel projection pursuit type method for dimension reduction \r\nwhich is\r\naimed at subsequent classification or mode hunting. This task involves both \r\nalgorithmic\r\nand theoretical challenges, and again \"shape\" aspects (modes, antimodes, etc.)\r\ncome into play.\r\n\r\nIn more general terms it can be said that there is an acknowledged lack of\r\n(theoretical) understanding of many statistical methods for large and \r\ncomplex data\r\nsets, and enhancing this knowledge is considered to be an important task of \r\nstatistics\r\n(see Kettenring et al. 2003). This project is aimed at contributing to\r\nthis task both directly and indirectly: (a) directly by providing an \r\nanalysis of\r\nsome of the existing data mining procedures, and (b) indirectly by developing\r\nnovel methods for large and complex data sets including supporting\r\nstatistical theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
