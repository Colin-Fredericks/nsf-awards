 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solecki's research interests lie in applications of\r\nmathematical logic (model theory, set theory and, primarily,\r\ndescriptive set theory) to analysis and topology. The project\r\nconsists of several parts. For example, Solecki proposes to\r\ninvestigate a problem of automatic continuity of universally\r\nmeasurable homomorphisms on Polish groups. A possible solution to\r\nthis problem will certainly involve descriptive set theory of\r\nPolish groups. However, it is also likely to rely heavily, on the\r\none hand, on set theoretic assumptions (like the Continuum\r\nHypothesis) and, on the other hand, on algebraic properties of the\r\nunderlying group (amenability, freeness). Indications of the\r\nconnections between this problem and set theory and algebra can be\r\nfound in earlier work of Christensen, Mokobodzki and Solecki. In\r\nanother part of the project, Solecki will apply methods developed\r\nfirst in set theory (in the study of Borel equivalence relations)\r\nto problems in topology and model theory. First, he will use\r\ndescriptive set theoretic techniques augmented by tools coming\r\nfrom model theory to investigate the structure of an important\r\ntopological space---the pseudo-arc. Second, he will apply methods\r\nfrom descriptive set theory to study groups associated canonically\r\nwith countable complete theories---Lascar's Galois groups.\r\n\r\nIn the project, Solecki will apply techniques and notions\r\ndeveloped in mathematical logic to problems in other areas of\r\nmathematics. For example, he will investigate a certain\r\ntopological space---a hereditarily indecomposable continuum called\r\nthe pseudo-arc. These types of topological spaces were first\r\nintroduced in mathematics in the first quarter of the twentieth\r\ncentury as curious examples of extremely complicated curves.\r\nToday, we know that they appear naturally in many mathematical\r\ncontexts, e.g., in fluid dynamics, in smooth dynamical systems\r\nliving in Euclidean spaces, among topological groups, in the study\r\nof continuous functions, etc. Solecki intends to gain a better\r\nunderstanding of the pseudo-arc by using methods from descriptive\r\nset theory, a branch of mathematical logic, which were originally\r\ndeveloped to study in an effective way the size of abstract sets.\r\nIt is hoped that crossing boundaries of subfields of mathematics\r\nby applying set theoretic methods in analysis and topology should\r\nlead to new and substantial insights.\r\n\r\n",
