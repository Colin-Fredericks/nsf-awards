 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goals of this project are to understand how stationary wave patterns may change in response to increases in greenhouse gas concentrations, to assess the impact on atmospheric teleconnection dynamics, and to explore the linkages between changes in the zonal mean flow in response to greenhouse warming.  Off-line linear and non-linear stationary wave models are to be used to identify the forcing agents responsible for the stationary wave responses.  Climate changes are expected to alter these responses by, for example, impacting on the location and intensity of atmospheric jet streams.  The research is motivated by the fact that stationary waves determine regional climate and, to some extent, the teleconnection dynamics of the atmosphere.  The research is important because it has the potential to improve models and their ability to predict weather and climate.\r\n\r\nThe project involves undergraduate students who will actively participate in the research tasks.",
