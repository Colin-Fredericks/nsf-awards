Besides their original application, they\r\nhave proven to be useful in other fields, for example, in non-linear PDE.\r\nThe objective of the proposal is twofold: to achieve a\r\ngood understanding of the scalar case for small moments and low\r\ndimensions, and to develop a general method to lift bounds from the\r\nscalar case to operator-valued potentials. In this way, estimates in\r\nlow dimension would have immediate consequences for bounds in higher\r\ndimensions.\r\nSecondly, the author plans to study Wegner estimates for the integrated\r\ndensity of states for singular random potentials. These are important\r\na-priori estimates in the spectral theory of random Schr\"odinger operators.\r\nThe third problem focuses on spectral properties of a non self-adjoint\r\nmatrix Schr\"odinger operator, given by the linearization of NLS around\r\nsolitons. In particular, the question of embedded eigenvalues will be studied.\r\nThese results should lead to a better understanding of asymptotic completeness\r\nfor focusing NLS.\r\n\r\n The proposed projects aim at some basic questions in\r\nmathematical physics, more precisely, the rigorous study of non-relativistic quantum\r\nmechanics. Recent results on Lieb-Thirring inequalities have revived the general\r\ninterest in this field and have proven useful in other areas of mathematical physics.\r\nIt is expected that they will continue to do so. One aim of this proposal is to\r\nfind new tools to establish these kind of inequalities.\r\nRandom Schr\"odinger operators model the behaviour of electrons in disordered\r\nmatter. It is a fact from every day life that highly disordered materials are bad\r\nconductors. In the last two decades, our mathematical understanding of this and\r\nrelated effects has grown rapidly. But basically all models still have some unrealistic\r\nassumptions. An important a priori estimate for the spectral theory of random Schr\"odinger\r\noperators are regularity results (i.e., smoothness) for the so-called density of states.\r\nDespite a lot of attention from several groups working in theory of random Schr\"odinger\r\noperators, the regularity proofs are still mainly based on the old ideas of Wegner. They\r\nrequire strong nd mainly technical assumptions, excluding most physically relevant rough\r\nrandom potentials. Except for some very special cases, singular random potentials are still\r\nout of reach of the existing methods. So new ideas and, in particular, a better understand\r\nof the underlying physical mechanism will be required, in order to be able to establish the\r\nregularity results for rough random potentials.\r\nThe third problem, embedded eigenvalues for a certain class of non self-adjoint matrix\r\nSchr\"odinger operators, is motivated by the study of the non-linear Schr\"odinger equation.\r\nBy itself it is still a problem in linear functional analysis. However, with the twist that\r\nvery a fine and detailed knowledge of the properties of this linearized operator is needed\r\nin order to improve the understanding of the long-time properties of solutions of the\r\nnon-linear Schr\"odinger equation.\r\n",
