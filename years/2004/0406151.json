 "awd_abstract_narration": "The shape or image of an object may be recorded digitally by a finite \r\nnumber k of landmarks or positions on the object, called a k-ad. The space \r\nof orbits under rotation and translation of k-ads is the size-and-shape \r\nspace. If one includes scaling with rotation and translation, then the \r\nspace of orbits under the resulting group of transformations on the k-ads\r\nis the shape space. These are examples of Riemannian manifolds, some with \r\nsingularities. One approach proposed here for inference about a \r\ndistribution on a general differentiable or Riemannian manifold M, based \r\non a random sample from it, is to carry out a multivariate analysis of the \r\nimage under the so-called Log map on one or more tangent spaces to M. \r\nApart from this intrinsic approach, less computation intensive extrinsic \r\nprocedures based on embeddings in Euclidean spaces are investigated. The \r\nproject explores consistency and asymptotic distribution theory on \r\nmanifolds for robust tests and confidence regions from both points of \r\nview--intrinsic and extrinsic.\r\n\r\n   One motivation for this study comes from the need to identify \r\ndeformations or shape changes for purposes of medical diagnosis and \r\nbiomorphology. Immediate applications also arise to machine vision and \r\npattern recognition. There are significant impacts of this research on \r\nthese and many other fields. Another important goal of this project is to \r\ntrain students in the newly developed methodologies, leading to the \r\ndissemination of knowledge gained through this research and the creation \r\nof a body of technicians and experts to apply it.\r\n",
