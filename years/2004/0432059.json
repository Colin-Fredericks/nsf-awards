This conference, organized jointly by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers and the Indian Institute of Chemical Engineers, is the first of its kind. The conference theme, Chemical Engineering in a Global Environment, is addressed specifically in sessions discussing: Science and Technology Policy: Intellectual Property Issues, Corporate Research and Development in a Global Setting, A Workshop for the Promotion of Collaborative Research Programs sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the Indian Department of Science and Technology, and a session on Education for Curricular changes in the face of current trends in the chemical engineering profession. A special report on the proceedings of these sessions is envisaged. Other topical sessions in frontier areas in chemical engineering are included with provision for plenary and keynote lectures in each session in addition to contributed papers from academia and industry. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposed activity lies in the scope of sessions devoted to frontier areas in chemical engineering education and research by experts from industry and academia in both the United States and India. The global theme of the conference greatly widens the scope for broader impacts of the conference in view of its focus on several technological issues of mutual interest, such as energy and environment as well as education, for two nations with very different economic backgrounds but substantial intellectual resources.   \r\n\r\n",
