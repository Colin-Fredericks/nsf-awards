 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is awarding thirty scholarships per year for four years, thereby increasing the number of individuals with associate degrees as well as increasing the number of students who are transferring to upper division institutions and/or directly entering the workforce. The project is being implemented at five participating Miami Dade College campuses (Wolfson, North, Inter American, Kendall, and Homestead) and is building on lessons learned from previous CSEMS grants. \r\n\r\nFaculty members are providing a key factor in helping the scholars achieve their goals through a high-touch and high-tech mentoring and tutoring process. They are meeting with the students at least twice a month where they are helping them develop their individual Comprehensive Educational Plan, assessing their academic progress that includes feedback from the students' instructors, and helping the students implement more effective learning strategies. Alumni Club members consisting of past CSEMS scholars are serving as role models and providing assistance in motivating the students by sharing their experiences and providing an opportunity for the scholars to network with industrial personnel.\r\n\r\nThe scholars are engaging in hands-on, practical experiences, which include participating in the STEM Club; creating an Internet-based personal journal; participating in conferences and meetings of professional and scientific associations; internships; and field trips to industry and academic institutions. A broad coalition of agencies and organizations are participating in an effort to provide support for the scholars. The project is targeting women and underrepresented classes of students. \r\n\r\n",
