We focus on almost\r\nhyperbolic systems and some related systems.  An smooth dynamical\r\nsystem is almost hyperbolic if it is hyperbolic everywhere except\r\nat a finite set of points.  Such systems may have quite different\r\nergodic behaviors from uniformly hyperbolic systems.\r\nIn this project we will study existence of equilibrium states,\r\nincluding SRB measures and absolutely continuous invariant\r\nmeasures in multidimensional spaces; rates of convergence to the\r\nequilibrium states for both finite and infinite measure cases,\r\nand some related topics such as rates of decay of correlations of\r\nthe systems and the central limit theorem;  some other ergodic\r\nproperties of the systems such as stochastic stability, Gibbs\r\nproperties, topological conjugation. We are also interested in\r\nusing these or similar systems to construct varies examples of\r\nsystems that have given properties, for instance, diffeomorphisms\r\nor flows on any manifolds that preserve the Riemannian\r\nvolume, have nonzero Lyapunov exponents almost everywhere, and\r\nhave countably many ergodic components.\r\n\r\n\r\nErgodic theory concerns the statistic behavior of systems.\r\nErgodic properties of uniformly hyperbolic systems were the main\r\nresearch subject in smooth dynamical systems from 60's to 80's.\r\nThe behaviors of such systems are regarded as chaotic.\r\nNow nonuniformly hyperbolic systems become a main research topic\r\nin the field.  This project is devoted to the study of ergodic\r\nproperties of almost hyperbolic systems and some other related\r\nsystems. Almost hyperbolic systems are smooth dynamical systems\r\nin which hyperbolic conditions are violated at only finitely\r\nnumber of points.  These systems lie on the boundary of the set\r\nof uniformly hyperbolic systems, and are the simplest but\r\nnontrivial nonuniformly hyperbolic systems.  Earlier studies on\r\nexamples of such systems, such as systems on the intervals and\r\ntorus, show that some ergodic properties may change dramatically.\r\nIn this project we try to develop some theorems for general\r\nalmost hyperbolic systems rather than individual examples.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
