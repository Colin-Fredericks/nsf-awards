 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strogatz\r\n\r\nMany populations of biological oscillators can exhibit remarkable\r\ncollective behavior.  Despite differences in their individual\r\nnatural frequencies, the oscillators spontaneously synchronize to\r\na common frequency.  Examples include chorusing crickets,\r\nfireflies that flash in unison, and synchronous firing of cardiac\r\npacemaker cells.  In several other branches of science and\r\ntechnology, one would like to imitate nature's success at\r\ndesigning networks that can synchronize themselves.  For\r\ninstance, a semiconductor laser array generates greater\r\ncollective power when it synchronizes, but such phase-locked\r\noperation is notoriously difficult to achieve in practice.  The\r\nPI and his students study the dynamics of oscillator networks,\r\nusing mathematical methods of dynamical systems theory,\r\nbifurcation theory, and statistical mechanics, along with\r\nnumerical simulation.  One project investigates a peculiar\r\nmathematical phenomenon that was recently discovered in a model\r\nof cellular oscillators communicating with one another through\r\nthe exchange of a signaling molecule.  Three additional projects\r\nventure into areas where oscillator theory has rarely been\r\napplied, namely molecular genetics, stochastic analysis, and the\r\ninterplay of human behavior and civil engineering.  The goal in\r\neach case is to answer a mathematically fascinating question that\r\nis important in the real world.  Specifically: (1) How can one\r\nbuild the analog of a multicellular biological clock, using\r\nsynthetic gene circuits?  (2) Can a precise biological clock be\r\nmade by synchronizing many imprecise components, and is this what\r\ntakes place in our own circadian pacemakers? (3) What caused\r\nLondon's Millennium Bridge to wobble on opening day?  Each of\r\nthese projects enlists the collaboration of a top experimentalist\r\nin the relevant field.\r\n\r\nNetworks of oscillators arise throughout science and technology\r\nand are ubiquitous in nature: lasers arrays work better when they\r\noscillate synchronously, structures such as buildings and bridges\r\ncan be endangered by synchronous oscillation, synchronous firing\r\nof cardiac pacemaker cells keeps hearts beating.  The\r\ninvestigator mathematically explores the behavior of networks of\r\noscillators, studying how networks synchronize themselves.  \r\nBenefits are expected for the understanding of how rhythmically\r\nactive cells work together in tissues and organs; for the\r\ncharacterization of the potentially dangerous ways that crowds of\r\npedestrians can inadvertently cause footbridges to shake; and for\r\nspin-offs to technological applications involving arrays of\r\noscillators, such as lasers, microwave oscillators, and\r\nsuperconducting Josephson junctions.  By training three graduate\r\nstudents through the research opportunities offered here, this\r\nproject also helps to develop human resources that are vital to\r\nour nation's success in science and engineering.\r\n",
