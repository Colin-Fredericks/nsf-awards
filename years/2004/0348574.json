 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this U.S.-Venezuela dissertation enhancement project funded by the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Animal Behavior Program of the Division of Integrative Biology and Neuroscience, Zuleyma Tang-Martinez and Elizabeth Condon of the University of Missouri, Saint Louis will pursue a program of research with Emilio Herrera of Universidad Simon Bolivar in Caracas, Venezuela.  The research will focus on the natal dispersal and new group formation of the world's largest rodent, the capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris).  This project has three main goals: 1) to define the behavioral aspects of capybara dispersal, including the variables that might trigger it; 2) to define the spatial aspects of their dispersal; and 3) to relate the dispersal patterns to the genetic structure of the population.  \r\n\r\nThis investigation focuses on a topic of considerable importance to understanding the evolution of mammalian social systems.  It also is of general interest to those studying dispersal and social dynamics of mammals.  The results are expected to have considerable conservation impact as well as implications for sustainable management of this important South American rodent.  The collaboration with the Venezuelan scientist will enhance the research efforts of both teams.  The project will also provide an international research experience for a US student.\r\n",
