 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal targets a set of interdisciplinary tasks that directly address the challenges facing\r\nthe burgeoning field of quantum information processing (QIP). In particular, both foundational\r\nwork aimed at enhancing the understanding of fundamental underlying concepts, such as quan-tum\r\nentanglement, as well as applied work, such as designing quantum algorithms that would\r\nrequire only tens of qubits, while still providing better performance than their classical counter-parts,\r\nare targeted. The technical approaches to be adopted in the proposed work encompass\r\na number of different fields, including quantum mechanics, quantum information theory and\r\nconcepts, theory of computation, combinatorics, and classical electromagnetic fields and related\r\ncomputational methods.\r\nIntellectual Merits: A number of fundamental challenges need to be overcome before QIP\r\ncan become a viable computing paradigm. This proposal addresses several of these challenges\r\nin a novel fashion, including: (i) What kinds of quantum algorithms can one implement in\r\nsystems comprising tens of qubits? This is a very important issue facing the field of quantum\r\ncomputation: a system comprising the thousands of qubits necessary to factorize integers beyond\r\nthe capability of existing classical computers is, at best, a long-term goal. In contrast, a system\r\ncomprising tens of qubits is a conceivable goal; however, would there be any quantum algorithm\r\nthat can be implemented on such a small scale computer and yet outperform classical algorithms?\r\nThe proposal presents a quantum algorithm that can be used to simulate Maxwell's equations to\r\ndetermine classical electromagnetic mode frequencies of resonant structures, where the complete\r\nmode field distribution is not required. It is estimated that  50 logical qubits would be sufficient\r\nto produce useful electromagnetic simulation results. (ii) Is there life beyond Quantum Key\r\nDistribution? The proposal presents results where the basic tools of quantum cryptography are\r\nused to build a multi-participant protocol which gives the participants the ability to anonymously\r\nannounce classical information. This protocol is shown to be secure against any and all attacks.\r\nThis is the first ever multi-participant quantum protocol that uses a truly multipartite quantum\r\nentangled state. (iii) What are examples of nontrivial new quantum algorithms (i.e., other\r\nthan Shor's factorization and Gover's search algorithms? The proposal reports results on the\r\ndevelopment of efficient quantum algorithms for determining the permanent of unitary and\r\nrelated matrices using the quantum optical model. A number of such critical open questions\r\nrelated to QIP are addressed.\r\nBroader Impacts: (i) Undergraduate Interdisciplinary Program: In collaboration with the Cal-ifornia\r\nNano-science Institute (CNSI) and the Department of Electrical Engineering at UCLA,\r\nwe are in the process of developing a nano-science interdepartmental program. Quantum in-formation\r\nprocessing is a key component of this program and the NSF grant will be leveraged\r\nto support this initiative, and in training graduate and undergraduate students. (ii) Annual\r\nWorkshops On Quantum Information Processing: In collaboration with the NSF Institute of\r\nPure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) at UCLA, an interdisciplinary annual workshop on\r\nQuantum Information Processing and Computing will be held. (iii) Providing Support for\r\nImplementation-Oriented DARPA projects on Quantum Computing: Dr. Roychowdhury is the\r\nprincipal theoretician for a large interdisciplinary experimental group at UCLA working on de-veloping\r\nsolid-state based quantum information processing technology. The experimental effort\r\nis currently supported by grants from DARPA and ARO, and the NSF grant will leverage the\r\nexisting program and focus on transferring theoretical results to the experimental groups. (iv)\r\nOutreach and Minority Student Participation: Both IPAM and CNSI have institutional infras-tructures\r\nin place to attract minority and K12 students, and we plan to engage them and train\r\nthem through seminars and free access to our workshops.",
