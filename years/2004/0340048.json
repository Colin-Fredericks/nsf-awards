 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop the technological and theoretical foundation of a high-speed terahertz (THz) tomographic non-destructive evaluation (NDE) imaging system. It is proposed to construct and evaluate a multiple THz transmitter and receiver module array test-bed to be employed with a commercially availability spectrometer system. This test-bed will be configured in a tomographic configuration and initially employ 4 and 6 elements in Phase I. This test-bed will be used to evaluate 1) the functional parameters and the feasibility of gathering multiple channels of data from an array of modules driven by the same split fiber optic source; and 2) the functional parameters and the feasibility of the reconstruction of 3 dimensional tomographic images from simple test objects scanned by the array. THz imaging has shown great potential, and there is great potential for innovation and research to provide a quantum leap in imaging speed and three dimensional image reconstruction. The image formation rate and three-dimensional image construction have been identified as two of the most important enabling factors in the widespread adoption of this technology for commercial applications.\r\n\r\nTHz tomography offers tremendous market potential in the fields of Non-Destructive Examination (NDE), and homeland security. THz imaging can be used for the NDE of plastic and composite materials in aerospace and other industries, to insure strength and safety of manufactured components. In addition, rapid imaging of concealed explosives, biological agents, chemical weapons, flammables, metallic and non-metallic weapons, and other potentially dangerous items are of great concern to many civilian and governmental agencies (transportation security, law enforcement), and industries such as commercial aviation. This STTR collaboration will foster the developmental collaboration between industry and university in this rapidly advancing field.\r\n",
