The U.S. investigator, Yingwei Fei of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and French investigator, Chrystele Sanloup of the Universite Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris, will investigate iron systems through multi-anvil experiments by in situ measurements of density and structure of liquids.  The in situ measurements will take place at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France. The proposed research is aimed at understanding differentiation of the Earth and the composition and structure of its liquid core.  The results will advance understanding on the origin of the magnetic field and impact research in petrology, mineral physics, geochemistry, seismology and geodynamics.  The project takes advantage of access to unique facilities in France and x-ray techniques utilized by the French investigator.\r\n\r\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) jointly support this project.  NSF provides funding for visits to France by the U.S. investigator.  The CNRS will cover the costs of the French investigator's travel to the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
