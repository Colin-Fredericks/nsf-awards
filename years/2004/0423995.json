 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the 48 th , 49 th and 50 th annual meetings of the Wind River Conference on Procaryotic Biology, to be held at the Aspen Lodge, Estes Park, Colorado. The 48 th meeting will be held on June 2-6, 2004. The dates for the other two years will not be determined until 12 months prior to the meetings. The conference is primarily concerned with the biology of procaryotes, and is the major, annually occurring meeting devoted to this subject area. A significant feature of these meetings is their accessibility to graduate and post-doctoral students, whose travel funds are frequently limited. To address this problem, funds from the award are used to provide travel and support scholarships to facilitate the attendance of graduate and post-doctoral students working in the various areas that comprise procaryotic biology. Corporate funds are also used to provide expenses for 3 - 4 distinguished scientists (per meeting) as plenary speakers. The meeting helps disseminate science information and provides a platform for students to give oral presentations. Moreover the speakers and students are encouraged to interact and exchange ideas and information and when possible to build long-term interactions. Since the topics of interest of this conference span the broad range of procaryotic research, there is a great deal of cross discipline discussion and communication.",
