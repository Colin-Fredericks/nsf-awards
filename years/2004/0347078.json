 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates two different but intertwined lines\r\nof research: (A) quantum computational complexity, and, \r\n(B) polynomial approximation of Boolean functions and its \r\napplications in quantum and classical complexity. The goals are: \r\n(1) to develop fundamental mathematical tools for analyzing the \r\ninherent power and limitations of quantum computing, and (2)\r\nto enrich the connections of polynomial approximations of Boolean\r\nfunctions with quantum and classical complexity theory, as well \r\nas to develop fundamental techniques to solve the corresponding \r\napproximation problems. \r\n\r\nTowards these tow goals, a wide range of problems in both quantum \r\nand classical complexity, as well as related approximation \r\nproblems are being investigated, with techniques drawn from \r\napproximation theory, harmonic analysis, matrix analysis, \r\nconvexity, etc.. Direction (B) is also part of the PI's longer \r\nterm objective to develop a theory of polynomial approximations \r\nof Boolean functions, which at its current stage still has \r\nfundamental obstacles to overcome.\r\n\r\nThe research on polynomial approximations of Boolean functions \r\nwould provide powerful tools from classical mathematics for \r\ncomputer science, and promote collaborations between the two\r\ncommunities from approximation theory and theory of computation.\r\nQuantum computing promises revolutionary, far-reaching impacts \r\non the society through its paramount superiority over current \r\ntechnologies in the efficiency and the security of information \r\nprocessing. This project could contribute significantly to the \r\nfoundations of quantum information processing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
