 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed exploratory research is to investigate novel polymeric nanoscale pulsed\r\npower capacitor flexible thin films based on the self-assembly of block copolymers. The flexible\r\npulsed power capacitor system would exhibit a lamellar or cylindrical microphase separation, with\r\nelectrode, and polymeric electrolyte as the A and B blocks. The A block (redox cobalt oxide\r\nor p-doped conductive polymer) forms the high surface area electrode material, and the B block\r\n(sulfonated polynorbornene or sulfonated polystyrene) is the electrolyte. Casting of the synthesized\r\nblock copolymer from a solvent results in a self-assembled A/B nanostructure, which is equivalent to\r\nmany nanoscale capacitor cells in parallel, thus providing the maximum possible power. A variety\r\nof microstructure and electrical properties characterization tools will be employed to evaluate the\r\nflexible pulsed power capacitor system's performance.                                                                                           \r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed exploratory research relate to a block copolymer nanoscale\r\ncapacitor device system which would be flexible because it is made out of a polymer, and transparent\r\nto visible light due to the nanoscale dimensions of its morphology. The ease of processing a\r\npolymer electrolyte would allow the production of thin film nanoscale self-assembled flexible pulsed\r\npower capacitors that could be wound into coils or processed as coatings and sheets. A pulsed\r\npower capacitor based on the nanoscale self-assembly of block copolymers will provide devices with\r\nintegrated electronics, yet distributed over a large area substrate as freestanding flexible films or\r\ncoatings. The active circuit components would be directly integrated on the flexible substrate.\r\nSuch supercapacitor system could be applied in power conditioning for directed energy weapon\r\ncomponents. The proposed nanoscale pulsed power capacitor system thus promises to open new\r\navenues for autonomous power of the all electric ships or airplanes and thus helping enhance\r\nhomeland security capabilities. The education activities to be undertaken in this work include\r\nundergraduate and graduate teaching, middle school teacher training, graduate student advising,\r\nand various opportunities in undergraduate research involvement and mentoring.",
