 "awd_abstract_narration": "Schmitz\r\n0418703\r\n\r\nThe Late Pennsylvanian through Early Permian was an important interval in Earth's history.\r\nSignificant events of this age include the final assembly and early evolution of Pangea, major eustatic\r\nchanges in sea level, and global climate change from the Pennsylvanian 'ice house' to the Permian 'hot\r\nhouse.' Unfortunately, the poor temporal resolution of the geologic time scale during this interval\r\nsubstantially limits our ability to clarify and correlate many aspects of late Paleozoic geologic history.\r\nCommonly cited time scales differ by as much as 14 Ma in the estimated age of the Pennsylvanian-\r\nPermian boundary, and vary by 500% in the inferred duration of various stages. Significant uncertainties\r\nin this part of the time scale arise because numerical ages assigned to period and stage boundaries are\r\nbased on linear interpolation between relatively sparse control points. Moreover, the existing control\r\npoints were obtained from geographically disparate stratigraphic sections, assigned positions in the time\r\nscale using several different taxa, and dated by several different radiometric techniques. Because much\r\nfundamental research depends directly on the accuracy and precision of the geologic time scale,\r\nimproving its age calibration is critical, and requires a robust, well-constrained, and internally-consistent\r\nframework of biostratigraphic and geochronologic data for the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian.\r\n\r\nThis is a three-year multidisciplinary research effort to calibrate this interval of the time scale\r\nusing the type sections and principal reference sections in the southern Ural foreland of Russia-\r\nKazakhstan. Three aspects of the southern Urals make this an excellent laboratory for age calibration:\r\nfirst, the internationally accepted definition of the chronostratigraphic scale for Early Permian\r\n(Cisuralian) comes from this region, and it is a principal reference area for the Late Pennsylvanian as\r\nwell; second, late-Paleozoic marine fauna (including small foraminifera, fusulinids, conodonts, and\r\nammonoids) are numerous and well preserved, allowing precise biostratigraphic control; and third,\r\ninterstratified volcanic ashes are common, making precise radiometric age control achievable. The proposed study will have truly global significance. Researchers worldwide working on a broad\r\nrange of Late Paleozoic problems will benefit directly and measurably from the results.",
