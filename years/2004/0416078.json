Brown, Collaborative Research: A global framework for the phylogeny of the gelechioid moths, a megadiverse radiation of herbivores. $183,000\r\n\r\n\tMoths and butterflies (Lepidoptera) represent one of the great explosions of insect diversity.  Among major lineages of Lepidoptera, Gelechioidea is one of the most successful radiations, both numerically and ecologically. Larvae are important in most terrestrial habitats and have a great diversity of feeding habits, but deep uncertainty regarding the evolutionary relationships among branches of the Gelechioidea makes it impossible to piece together supportable scenarios of ecological character evolution and host-plant selection. To date, most specialists have necessarily focused on a few taxa globally or many taxa locally, producing a patchwork of knowledge rather than a comprehensive synthesis.  Some authors place emphasis on certain characters rather than alternatives, some on features of the adults insects, others on immatures. We will use several approaches in order to sort the 37 major lineages that compose the group and define their relationships to each other.  First, we will build upon existing morphological matrices, adding new morphological characters not previously used in Lepidoptera to provide a grand matrix for about 150 to 175 species representing all major gelechioid lineages. The exemplars are chosen to represent variation in long-recognized lineages.  Second, we will provide DNA sequence data from several genes to augment the morphological matrix for phylogenetic analysis. We will also initiate an archival cryogenic collection including about 150 species, or as many species as possible, including those with particularly interesting host plants. Third, web-based identification keys and photo archives will be produced to make available the primary knowledge regarding taxa and characters as well as host information, and to cross reference DNA data with biological information. Finally, adaptive radiation and evolution of host choice and feeding syndromes will be interpreted in light of the phylogenetic framework, expanding on our earlier success in this regard. The bulk of the expenses of the total project are in student salaries, travel for personnel other than the PIs, and materials and supplies for the DNA laboratory work, respectively. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
