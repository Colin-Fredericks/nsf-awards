 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\n\tEnsign wasps (Hymenoptera: Evaniidae) are colorful, \r\nfrequently collected, and recognizable parasites of cockroach eggs, \r\nyet they have been relatively neglected by systematists and \r\nevolutionary ecologists.  The main obstacle to future research on \r\nevaniids is the current classification, which is outdated and \r\ninadequate.  The intent of this project is to overhaul evaniid \r\ntaxonomy, investigate the phylogenetic relationships within the \r\nfamily and between it and other major Hymenopteran groups, and to use \r\nthe relationships to examine several phenomena in an evolutionary \r\ncontext.  In part I, a revision of evaniid genera will be conducted \r\nbased on examination of a large body of material already assembled, \r\nand the new classification used to structure a world catalog of \r\nspecies following examination of type specimens in several major \r\nmuseums.  In part II, phylogenetic relationships among the genera \r\nwill be estimated using DNA sequence data from five genes (16S, COI, \r\n28S, LW Rh, and one new gene) along with morphological characters. \r\nIn Part III,  the relationships between Evaniidae and other \r\nHymenopteran superfamilies (emphasizing Evanioidea) will be estimated \r\nusing DNA sequence data from three genes that have already been \r\nwidely used across Hymenoptera (16S, COI and 28S).   The results of \r\nParts I through III will but useful not only for proposing new and \r\nmore predictive classifications, but also for investigating the \r\nevolution of oviposition behavior in these wasps, as well as their \r\nbiogeographic history.\r\n\tA promising young systematist will be trained during this \r\ndissertation project, and the results of the work will also have \r\nimmediate impact on the larger NSF-funded Assembling the Tree of Life \r\nproject on the megadiverse insect order Hymenoptera.  The new \r\ngeneriuc classification for Evaniidae will open up this fascinating \r\ngroup to further taxonomic and ecological study.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
