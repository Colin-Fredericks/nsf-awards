 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vision of this proposed work is to create more versatile  information systems by using autonomous and distributed sensor networks:  hundreds of small sensors, equipped with limited memory and actuation capabilities will autonomously organize themselves and move  to track a source and convey information about its location to  a human user, and to the rest of the team. Such distributed active  sensor networks are pervasive computing systems,  well-suited for tasks in extreme environments,  especially when the environmental model and the task specifications  are uncertain and the system has to adapt to it. \r\n\r\nTo create active sensor networks capable of such applications, a  fundamental goal of this research is to develop a science base for distributed sensor network control and information gathering and coordination.\r\nThis is a considerable challenge, which we propose to meet by the  synergistic integration of the following directions of work:  (1) new ideas for  communication in sensor networks; (2) new ideas for developing adaptive  active control and coordination in sensor networks; (3) new ideas for  information gathering and aggregation in sensor networks; and (4) experiments  grounded on realistic scenarios that measure empirically the performance  and scalability of the proposed communication and control algorithms.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the central challenges for this proposed work are  focused on developing, implementing and evaluating a suite of scalable  network protocols that (1) guarantee message delivery; (2) are  fault tolerant; (3) maximize the network lifetime; and (4) are adaptive to  the environment and to the task.\r\n",
