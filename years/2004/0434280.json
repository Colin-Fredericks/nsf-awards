 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) to do an archaeological survey of the first discovered Russian American Company shipwreck, Kad'yak, in Alaska.  The Kad'yak sank in 1860 and was rediscovered in 2003 off Spruce Island near Kodiak, Alaska.  Since this is the first ship of its kind found in Alaskan waters, the team of researchers need to do preliminary research investigating the wreck, make detailed recordings, determining the best scientific techniques for research in these waters and determine the viability of future field seasons and the possibility of raising artifacts and portions of the ship.   Secondly, although shipwreck is somewhat stabilized in the ocean floor, both natural processes and treasure hunters threaten the destruction and loss of the scientific information if not gathered in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research has the potential to provide primary material data on the Russian period in Alaska's maritime culture. In addition the Kad'yak has been determined eligible for the National Register of Historic Places because of its association with known historical events.  In addition, the project has a program for the development and training of graduate students in nautical archaeology.  By working with the AK State Museum and the Alutiiq Museum of Kodiak, a number of public outreach programs are being planned to better educate the public about Russian-Alaskan history and nautical archeology.\r\n\r\n",
