He will focus on the problem of dark energy, the dominant form of energy in the cosmos, which is responsible for the cosmic acceleration and has transformed our picture of the Universe. Discovery of the physical nature of dark energy would have a basic impact on many branches of physics. Combining cosmology, fields and gravitation, the PI will carry out analytic calculations and numerical computations to investigate: constraints and clues to the basic properties of the dark energy; fundamental physics models of the dark energy, such as quintessence; and the behavior of quintessence in rapidly varying gravitational fields and near black holes.  These investigations are well timed to coordinate with the many current and planned experimental and observational programs poised to reveal the nature of the dark energy.\r\n\r\nThe PI will build upon his commitment to education through a program of student mentoring and curriculum development at Dartmouth. To advance scientific literacy in the wider community, public lectures and outreach activities with local schools, through a partnership with a local science museum, will be undertaken. The centerpiece of these efforts will be a teacher enhancement workshop, to help teachers bring the excitement of cosmology back to the classroom.\r\n",
