 "awd_abstract_narration": "Broadly, the investigator studies specific mathematical\r\nmodels arising from the life sciences and develops new\r\nmathematical tools with which to analyze such models.  Models of\r\nbiofilms, previously developed by this investigator and\r\ncollaborators, are used to study important phenomena such as gene\r\ntransfer among micro-organisms and quorum sensing.  These models\r\nare based on the classical chemical engineering bio-reactors,\r\nnamely, the continuously stirred tank reactor and the tubular\r\nplug flow reactor with dispersion, and take the form of ordinary\r\ndifferential equations for the former and coupled parabolic\r\nequations with nonlinear boundary conditions for the latter.  The\r\naim is to understand the factors that facilitate biofilm\r\nformation, the factors involved in the successful introduction of\r\nnew genes via plasmid transfer in biofilm communities, and the\r\nrole of bacterial quorum sensing in these processes.  The study\r\nalso addresses a fundamental issue in population biology -- the\r\nso-called \"paradox of the plankton\": why can so many plankton\r\nspecies be supported by so few limiting resources in lakes and\r\nseas?  The same paradox arises with the microbial denizens of\r\narid soils that receive infrequent rains and deposition of\r\nnutrients -- another focus of the project.  The investigator's\r\naim is to introduce mathematical models based on the classical\r\nmodel of a multi-species community in which members compete\r\nexploitatively for several essential (nonoverlapping) resources\r\n(light, nitrogen, carbon, etc.) in a well-mixed environment and\r\nto provide mathematically rigorous results of an explanatory\r\nnature rather than numerical simulations.  On the mathematical\r\nside, the theory of monotone dynamical systems and persistence\r\ntheory have greatly contributed to the understanding of\r\nbiological models and the study aims to enhance and build on\r\nthese theories.\r\n\r\n     A substantial effort is devoted to study mathematical models\r\nof microbial processes in environmental settings where biofilms\r\nmay form on surfaces.  Biofilms are of great importance in the\r\nhealth sciences and industry, where their formation typically\r\nresults in negative outcomes.  They are responsible for food and\r\nwater contamination, dental caries and periodontal disease, and\r\nthe contamination of medical implants.  The focus is on\r\nunderstanding conditions favorable for biofilm formation, factors\r\ninvolved in gene transfer (e.g., antibiotic resistance) among\r\nmicroorganisms in biofilms, and the ability of organisms to\r\nchemically communicate their existence and current state to\r\nothers organisms on these processes.  Broadly, the study is\r\ncharacterized by a desire to obtain mathematically rigorous\r\nresults along with computer simulations.  Modelling and computer\r\nsimulations are widely acknowledged to be important tools in the\r\nstudy of biological systems.  The modelling process forces a\r\ncareful description of what are the known and important features\r\nof a system.  Computer simulations are important in order to\r\nexplore the implications of assumptions and sensitivity of model\r\nbehavior to parameter changes.  However, computer simulations\r\nalone seldom lead to a comprehensive understanding of a model,\r\nlet alone the underlying biological process, due to the inherent\r\nlimitations of the computer itself -- one can only test a\r\nrelatively small sample of the full range of model parameters,\r\nfollow the time course of the model over a relatively small time\r\nwindow, for a relatively small number of possible initial data. \r\nRigorous mathematical analysis can lead to real understanding of\r\na model and the underlying biological processes by identifying\r\nmechanisms responsible for model behavior.  Unfortunately, the\r\nmathematical tools necessary to provide a careful mathematical\r\nanalysis are often not currently available.  The study seeks to\r\ndevelop such tools and to apply them to problems in the life\r\nsciences.\r\n",
