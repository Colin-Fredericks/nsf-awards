More specifically, he\r\naims to\r\n(A) Determine the resonance structure of and construct the scattering theory\r\nfor systems of non-relativistic particles such as atoms and molecules\r\ninteracting with the quantized electromagnetic field;\r\n(B) Construct scattering theory and the theory of periodic/quasiperiodic\r\nmotion of solitons (or solitaty wave solutions) for the nonlinear\r\nSchroedinger equation with an external\r\npotential;\r\n(C) Construct theory of tunneling for solitons in the nonlinear Schroedinger\r\nequation with an external potential and in the (second) quantized version of\r\nthis equation.\r\n    Mathematically, these problems deal with linear partial differential\r\nequations in an infinite number of variables (A) and with nonlinear partial\r\ndifferential equations with interplay between the nonlinearity and geometry\r\nof the external potentials (B) as well as with the problems bridging both\r\nframeworks (C).\r\n    The problems above originate in our trying to describe some\r\nbasic physical phenomena such as emission and absorption of radiation by\r\nquantum, non-relativistic systems (e.g., atoms and molecules) and dynamics\r\nof Bose-Einstein condensates. They also play an important role in\r\ntechnological applications, e.g. optical communication. It is hoped that the\r\nresults the research to be undertaken will provide conceptual and unifying\r\nunderpinning to a\r\nmore quantative (phenomenological, numerical and\r\nexperimental) physical treatment.\r\n     In selecting the research projects above the PI was guided by their\r\nimportance, possibility of the emergence of new mathematics and by the\r\navailability of tools and ideas to start probing them. These projects will\r\nalso provide fertile ground for excellent\r\nentry problems for graduate students, postdocs and beginning faculty whom\r\nthe PI will supervise and mentor.\r\n",
