 "awd_abstract_narration": "This catalyst project lays the foundation for a future NSF Science of Learning Center that will focus on the interrelationships among mathematics, language, and cognition in the learning process. It will examine how deaf and hard-of-hearing students (K-12 through post-secondary education) learn mathematics as compared to hearing peers. The operational definition of mathematics for this project is the target learners' abilities for conceptual understanding, procedural knowledge, and problem solving, as well as their powers to reason, make connections, and communicate mathematical knowledge. The three primary tasks of this catalyst project are:\r\n1. Proof-of-concept research. Conduct an initial series of integrative multidisciplinary studies for a new program of research on mathematics, language, and cognition. This effort includes researchers from mathematics education, cognitive psychology, linguistics, language acquisition, American Sign Language studies, psychometrics, and ethnography, as well as mathematics practitioners.\r\n2. Partnership building. Additional national and international collaborators (researchers, practitioners, parents) will be recruited for their expertise and breadth of perspective.\r\n3. Planning for educational outreach. This task will focus primarily on bridging research to practice.\r\n\r\nThis project integrates multiple research traditions to extend current knowledge of the role of language and cognition in mathematics learning. By studying deaf and hard-of-hearing learners' mathematical abilities and reasoning powers, this project expects to reveal more in-depth understanding of the relationships among language, cognition, and mathematics learning. Findings should apply to other learner populations including students with learning disabilities or developmental needs, second language learners, and the general hearing student population.\r\n\r\n",
