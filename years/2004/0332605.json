The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-03521).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners include SUNY Stony Brook (Lead Institution), Hofstra University, Farmingdale State University, Suffolk County Community College, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Northrop Grumman, Symbol, CardioMag Imaging, Transonics, Tracer Detection Technology Corporation, Technology Next Corporation, BioPhotonics Corporation, IEEE, LISTnet, WEDLI, Long Island Regional Incubator Council, Empire State Development, Suffolk County, and New York State Sensor CAT Center.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to promote and increase awareness of and expansion of entrepreneurship and technology transfer on Long Island with emphasis on national security and medical sensor systems. The collaboration includes research and technology partners from the private sector and non-profit organizations and governmental agencies. The project has three clear components: \r\na) to introduce entrepreneurial skills to the engineering and technology curriculum across Long Island, \r\nb) to provide outreach and dissemination through outreach partners, \r\nc) to provide an infrastructure to promote research and technology transfer in security and medical sensor systems. The goal of the Research and Technology Transfer component would be to promote research and technology transfer in security and medical sensor systems. The goal of the Outreach and Dissemination component would be to promote the Sensor Consortium's achievements through the project's Outreach Partners.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\nThe activities will result in more patentable inventions, more startup technology companies, and more research and development in national security and medical sensor systems in the region.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the activity lies in creation of involvement of undergraduate students in entrepreneurial training and planning to transfer technology from the research at the Sensor CAT Center at SUNY Stony brook to form startup companies.\r\n\r\nThe proposed consortium broadens the participation of several different types of educational institutions and an even more diverse population of students in the innovation enterprise.\r\n",
