 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering NEC (59)  This project is developing four learning modules to improve instruction, student learning of statistical quality control (SQC), and to apply SQC tools in practice. The learning modules being developed enable a student to develop the higher-order thinking skills needed to examine and modify a virtual plant through a web interface to (1) benchmark the quality of a process using production and quality metrics, (2) apply the Magnificent 7 (common SQC improvement tools) to identify opportunities for improvement, (3) design and implement control charts for variables and (4) conduct a process capability analysis.  The modules provide the framework for students to analyze the current operating condition of a plant, select the most appropriate portion of the plant to apply SQC tools, design and implement the SQC tool and evaluate the effectiveness of the quality improvement project.  Objectives are being developed for each module, incorporated into assessing student learning and used as a feedback mechanism to improve student learning. Hispanic undergraduate and graduate students are participating in research and two of the three test sites are Hispanic-serving institutions.  Results are being broadly disseminated through a project website, interactions with three test sites, presentations to local professional societies and publication of research results.",
