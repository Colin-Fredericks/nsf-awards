 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project addresses several problems of central importance \r\nin the areas of designs, codes and association schemes. The \r\nemphasis will be on the use of algebraic and number theoretic \r\nmethods in the above areas. Topics of the proposed research \r\ninclude Smith normal forms of subspace-inclusion matrices (q-analogues \r\nof the subset-inclusion matrices); connections between difference sets and \r\nmaximal arcs in projective spaces; strongly regular graphs, two-weight \r\ncodes and association schemes. Number theoretic tools, such as Gauss and \r\nJacobi sums, have been used with success by the PI and others in all of the \r\nafforementioned topics. It is expected that deeper p-adic number theory \r\nand representation theory of the general linear group will be necessary in \r\nthe further investigations of these topics. \r\n\r\nCombinatorial designs first arose in recreational mathematics problems, \r\nsuch as Kirkman's 15 schoolgirls problem, and later in the design of \r\nstatistical experiments. They found many applications in coding theory, \r\nfinite geometry, cryptography, computer science, and electrical engineering. \r\nDesigns and codes are intimately related. Many efficient error-correcting \r\ncodes are constructed from designs. These codes are used nowadays in our \r\ndaily life, for example, in CD players, high-speed modems, and cellular \r\nphones. This proposal investigates several problems in the interface of \r\ndesigns and codes, and gives summer support for a graduate student who will \r\nstudy and work in the areas of design theory and coding theory related to the \r\nabove mentioned applications.\r\n",
