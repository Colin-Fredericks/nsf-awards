 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to perform system-level measurements of end-to-end performance of novel components including ultra-narrow line width laser sources, optical signal processing and optical memory components using spatial-spectral holography (SSH) techniques, highly-tunable light sources, and unique ultra-dense wavelength division multiplexing (UDWDM) techniques. These novel components leverage a rich research foundation in optical materials at Montana State University (MSU) dedicated to the exploration of optically active crystals and emerging organic materials. These materials and components will be used to develop new system architectures to simultaneous exploit temporal, spatial and spectral domains to achieve orders of magnitude increases in the capacity and flexibility of communications networks. \r\n\r\nThis project enables MSU to provide system-level training to undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral students, and research staff in the use of state-of-the-art optical network test equipment and methodology. MSU has a strong tradition of combining research and teaching, engaging undergraduates through senior-level design projects during the academic year and participation in sponsored research in the academic year and over the summers. MSU has several active REU programs that engage students in device and system level research activities. The MSU REU programs actively seek out Native American students from the Tribal Colleges in Montana, and the College of Engineering is funded by the Hewlett Foundation to recruit and retain Native American undergraduate engineering students. This instrumentation grant leverages these other programs, providing additional educational opportunities. \r\n",
