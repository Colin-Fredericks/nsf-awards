Using a decomposition theorem of\r\nBiran, this implies several new kinds of symplectic intersection\r\nphenomena for compact Kahler manifolds. The goal of the first\r\nproject is to study these new intersection results which suggest\r\nthat many basic symplectic properties of a compact Kahler\r\nmanifold are determined by the Biran decompositions it\r\nadmits. The second project is a joint effort with V.L. Ginzburg\r\nand B.  Gurel. It involves the construction of a generalized\r\nversion of Hamiltonian Floer homology in which periodic orbits in\r\ndifferent homotopy classes are allowed to interact via a\r\ngeneralized Floer differential that counts perturbed holomorphic\r\ncurves with punctures. The construction is motivated by the\r\nSymplectic Field Theory of Eliashberg, Givental and Hofer. The\r\nresulting theory should also have a rich algebraic structure, as\r\nwell as a variety of applications including new calculations of\r\nthe Hofer-Zehnder capacity for weakly-exact symplectic\r\nmanifolds. The third project is a program to prove a conjecture\r\nwhich asserts the existence of periodic orbits on all level sets\r\nnear a nondegenerate symplectic critical submanifold of a\r\nHamiltonian. This is a generalization of some similar conjectures\r\nof Arnold which concern periodic orbits of a charged particle\r\nmoving in a magnetic field. The first step is to construct a\r\nFloer-type invariant for the underlying variational\r\nprinciple. Once it is rigorously defined, this should quickly\r\nlead to many new existence results. It is also hoped that this\r\ninvariant can be used to augment Symplectic Field Theory by\r\nallowing one to split a symplectic manifold along certain\r\nhypersurfaces which are not of contact type.\r\n\r\nHamiltonian flows are used to model many important physical\r\nsystems in which energy is conserved. Such systems include\r\nplanets and satellites moving under their mutual gravitational\r\nattraction, a charged particle moving in an electro-magnetic\r\nfield, and the flow of an incompressible ideal fluid. These\r\nmotions are often quite complex and one way to begin to\r\nunderstand their global behavior is to look for repeating\r\npatterns, i.e., periodic orbits. While most Hamiltonian flows\r\nhave many periodic orbits, it is usually a difficult problem to\r\nestablish their existence at a fixed energy level. This problem\r\nis a central theme in the study of Hamiltonian flows and, in\r\nmodern times, has been shown to be deeply related to the shape of\r\nthe space on which the flow is defined. The projects in this\r\nproposal study various aspects of this relation. In the first two\r\nprojects we use Hamiltonian flows to define and compute\r\nsymplectic invariants. The last project involves the construction\r\nof a new symplectic invariant which should lead to new existence\r\nresults for periodic orbits of Hamiltonian flows which describe\r\nthe motion of a charged particle in a magnetic field.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
