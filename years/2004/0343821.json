 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quorum sensing is a process that allows bacteria to communicate using secreted chemical signaling molecules called autoinducers. This process enables a population of bacteria to collectively regulate gene expression, and therefore behavior. In general, processes controlled by quorum sensing are ones that are unproductive when undertaken by an individual bacterium but become effective when undertaken by the group. For example, quorum sensing controls bioluminescence, secretion of virulence factors, sporulation, and conjugation. We now know that intra- and inter-species cell-cell communication occurs, and this combination of communication abilities was first described, and has been most thoroughly studied, in the model luminous bacterium Vibrio harveyi. The project focuses on V. harveyi, with the aims of exploring the molecular mechanisms used for quorum sensing controlled gene regulation, further defining the members of the quorum sensing regulon, determining the hierarchy of gene expression, and exploring how information from the intra- and inter-species autoinducers is integrated, processed and transduced to control community-wide behavior. Teaching and service related activities are being undertaken as part of this project. These activities include mentoring of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral fellows, instruction in Princeton University undergraduate and graduate courses, Direction of the Princeton Graduate Program in Molecular Biology, and Chairing of the Princeton University Biology Umbrella Development Program, and the Committee for Scientific Direction, Curriculum Development, and Faculty Recruitment. A high school outreach program is being developed for teaching science to local children and teens. Science exhibits are being developed for Science Museum in NYC. Editorial duties will be fulfilled on the boards of Molecular Microbiology, Genetics, Journal of Bacteriology, and Cellular an  Molecular Proteomics. Grant and fellowship review work will be performed for NSF, Keck, Damon Runyon, ASM and AAM.",
