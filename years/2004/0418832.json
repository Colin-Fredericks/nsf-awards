 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator and his colleagues construct and analyze\r\nminimal mathematical models of gamma (30-80 Hz) oscillations in\r\nthe hippocampus and neocortex.  The model networks are composed of\r\nsynaptically coupled excitatory and inhibitory (single- or\r\nmulti-compartment) integrate-and-fire neurons.  A major aim of the\r\nproject is a deeper understanding of the persistent gamma\r\noscillations observed in vitro by Eberhard Buhl, Miles\r\nWhittington, et al., and computationally simulated, using complex,\r\nbiophysically realistic models, by Roger Traub et al.  The greater\r\nsimplicity of the models in the present study permits much more\r\nextensive computational experimentation, as well as the\r\nmathematical analysis of the characteristics of the oscillations. \r\nTools from stochastic dynamics (noise-driven excitable systems)\r\nand probability (order statistics) are used in this analysis.  The\r\ninvestigator also studies hypothetical roles of gamma oscillations\r\nin attentional processes.  In this part of the project, the\r\nworking hypotheses are:\r\n  1.  Widespread, persistent gamma oscillations with infrequent,\r\nirregular participation of individual excitatory cells are a\r\ncorrelate of sustained attention. \r\n  2.  Ensemble-specific, transient gamma oscillations with\r\nfrequent participation of individual cells are a correlate of\r\nfocused attention.\r\nComputational simulation and mathematical analysis are used to\r\nexamine hypothetical functional roles of persistent gamma\r\noscillations in sustained attention (vigilance), and interactions\r\nof ensemble-specific transient gamma oscillations with a\r\nbackground of widespread persistent gamma oscillations.\r\n\r\n     Strong experimental evidence has shown a correlation between\r\nattention and gamma frequency oscillations in the brain.  However,\r\nit is not known how (or even whether) gamma oscillations support\r\nattentional processes.  This project aims at clarifying this link\r\nusing mathematical modeling, analysis, and computational\r\nsimulation.  Some experimental studies have indicated\r\nabnormalities in gamma frequency oscillations in the brains of\r\npatients with schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease.  A deeper\r\nunderstanding of gamma oscillations and their roles in attention\r\nmay therefore eventually prove important in understanding and\r\ntreating these diseases.  The project also provides training\r\nopportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n",
