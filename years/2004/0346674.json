 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: George Lee, SUNY Buffalo\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed to explore a new design concept on damage based design for highway \r\nbridges to resist earthquake ground motions and other dynamic loads.  This is a jointly supported \r\npilot study by NSF (Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems) and FHWA (Turner Fairbanks \r\nHighway Research Center) to develop new bridge design principles and criteria for future \r\napplications. \r\n \r\nIn this pilot project, proof-of-concept study is carried out, both analytically and experimentally \r\non a structural component by examining the damage initiation and accumulation process under \r\nselected input earthquake ground motions.  The PI intends to show that seismic performance of \r\nbridges may not be satisfactorily described by using the quasi-static approach or based on \r\nbehaviors under cyclic loading conditions.  Many structural damages are results of combined \r\nfailure modes (strength, deformation, stiffness, low cycle fatigue, etc.).  They can only be \r\nunderstood based on principles of structural dynamics of M-DOF systems.  Damage based \r\nperformance criteria are important foundations for the Bridge of the Future.\r\n\r\n",
