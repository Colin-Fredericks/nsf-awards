 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this project is to develop GaN-based gas sensors at high temperatures with improved sensitivity, response time, stability and reliability. The outcome of this research program will provide technology that will greatly enhance the capability of gas sensing in harsh environments. The technical merit of this exploratory research for new gas sensing materials and devices in harsh environments is as follows: (1) fundamental knowledge of the gas sensing mechanisms and the physics of GaN-based devices; (2) fabrication of GaN-based gas sensors for high temperature applications; and (3) advanced sensor packaging technology for extremely high temperature applications. \r\n\r\nThis new gas sensing technology will have great potentials in energy and automobile industry for next generation of energy, and in defense applications for anti-terrorism. The success of the project will provide technology for research and development in compact, efficient fuel cell system.  This project will provide an environment where students can be trained in a broader perspective of the research process, from device modeling, design, fabrication, to device testing and package. Collaborative efforts required in this project will allow students to broaden their research experience beyond the norm by learning new techniques and participating in related research normally outside their adviser's activities. Hence, students associated with this project will be trained on state-of-the-art methods that will be cornerstones for their future careers that will enhance the future infrastructure for research and education. Research discoveries and results will be incorporated in the course development.\r\n\r\n",
