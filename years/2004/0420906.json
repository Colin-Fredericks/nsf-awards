 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal, developing a networked system to allow safe and rapid analysis of network security and vulnerabilities with respect to worms, viruses, and other malicious conduct, creates a reconfigurable facility, named ReASSURE, for efficient reproducible, controlled, and safely contained experiments in computer science and technology with emphasis on information assurance and security. The new instrument will integrate functionalities in a manner that will enable high levels of safety and efficiency in manipulating, testing, and developing potentially dangerous experimental networking and virtual machine software while providing computational power to remote users. Advancing the study of virtual machine technology, the activity offers settings where potentially dangerous experimentation with networking and VM technologies can be performed safely. Providing as testbed networking facility, the infrastructure supports projects that require \"self-contained\" computing environments in computer science (including security), computer technology, forensics, and information warfares.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  Undergraduate classes will make use of the instrument, and both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in its making. Attention will be given to women and underrepresented groups. The testbed impacts 15 projects of 8 faculty members at Purdue and at the CERIAS affiliates, Syracuse University, and the US Air Force Institute of Technology.\r\n",
