 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to utilize the superior mechanical properties of statically and kinematically determinate truss structures (as defined by Maxwell's rule) in a novel way-to create a three-dimensional morphing system that provides both efficient propulsion and high maneuverability.  The idea is to take advantage of the stiffness and strength of these structures, and enable them to change shape by replacing some of the passive members with actuators.  This project will then study the feasibility of using this structure as the basis of a low powered, biomimetic-actuating system that can achieve the propulsive and control capabilities of the dolphin and manta ray.  The goal is to use this project as a first step in generating a bio-inspired autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), capable of performing tasks where it would be dangerous for humans to go.  To achieve the project's goals, the Principle Investigator will integrate the sciences of biomechanics, adaptive multifunctional materials, and artificial muscles.\r\n\r\n",
