 "awd_abstract_narration": "===========================ABSTRACT=============================\r\nNanocrystalline materials with characteristic grain size of 1-100 nanometers \r\nhave been synthesized and investigated extensively in the last decade. Small \r\nsized grains and large volume fraction of atoms sitting on grain or interface \r\nboundaries characterize these materials. They exhibit many unusual mechanical \r\nproperties, making them by far one of only a few nanoscale material systems \r\nthat have potential to be used as large-scale structural material in civil, \r\nmechanical, transport, and industrial applications. However, as the dimensions \r\nof the grain size are pushed down to nanometer scale, the degrees of difficulty \r\nmultiply in determining and understanding the mechanical properties and their \r\nrelations with microstructures. As a result, quantitative constitutive \r\nrelations for various mechanical properties and their relation with \r\nmicrostructures have not been fully established. This work aims at filling this \r\ngap by searching for micromechanical constitutive relations in nanocrystalline \r\nmaterials using large-scale atomistic simulations. To achieve this goal, we \r\nplan to perform large-scale atomistic modeling of various detailed \r\nmicrostructures and their contributions to constitutive relations in nanoscale \r\nenvironment. And to perform continuum modeling of deformation process in model \r\nnanocrystalline samples. The detailed constitutive relation and microstructure-\r\nproperty relation obtained from atomistic simulations will be used in corse-\r\ngrained modeling. The proposed topics are timely and answers to these questions \r\nare urgently needed for materials and mechanics community. Successful execution \r\nof this proposed work is expected to contribute to establishing systematic \r\napproaches for modeling microstructures and laying a solid foundation for \r\nconstitutive modeling of mechanical deformation in nanoscale polycrystalline \r\nmaterials.\r\n",
