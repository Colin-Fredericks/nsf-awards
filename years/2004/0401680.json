 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nProposal #01122628\r\nPurdue Research \r\nPalsberg,Jens\r\n\r\nStatic Timing of Interrupt-driven Software\r\n\r\nReal-time, reactive and embedded systems are widely and increasingly used throughout  society  (e.g.,  flight  control,  railway  signaling,  vehicle management systems, medical devices).  This trend is likely to continue, as applications  that  would  have been unthinkable only a few short years ago come  into  the  reach  of  ever  more  complex  processors.    Many   such applications  are long lived, interact with their environment continuously, and are under important real-time constraints.  As these  reactive  systems permeate  our lives, bringing us everything from intelligent pace-makers to tiny freshness-tracking devices in groceries, the need for  cost-effective, confidence-inspiring  software validation techniques grows proportionately.  This project focuses on building new tools for checking a  common  class  of reactive real-time systems known as interrupt-driven systems.  This proposed research has four facets that complement and support each other.  The first continues  our   preliminary  work  on  analyzing  seven  commercial microcontrollers to identify a static timing analysis that is  sufficiently precise for a single interrupt handler.  Second, ways of specifying and checking timing properties for multiple interrupt  handlers are being investigated.  Third, a typed assembly language is being developed with time bounds in which timing properties can be specified in a modular way, one handler at a time.  Fourth, a timed interrupt-handler calculus is being designed that will embody our results in a language-independent way and make it  tractable  to  prove key  properties.   The  new  tools will automatically derive a model of the software by static analysis and type checking, and submit the result  to  a model  checker.   The  tools  can  lead  to  significantly  reduced testing requirements, and provide support for  maintenance  throughout  the  system\r\nlife-cycle.\r\n",
