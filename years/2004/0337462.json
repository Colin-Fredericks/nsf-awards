 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators propose a study of two Andean volcanoes, Guagua Pichincha and Tungurahua, Ecuador, because they exhibit relatively frequent explosive events (both pyroclastic and phreato-magmatic) and offer unparalleled access for field study.  Activity at Pichincha is an analogue for active volcanism at: Unzen, Merapi, Bezmianny, and Monserrat.  Tungurahua is extremely hazardous due to its steep elevation and danger posed to the city of Banos.  The project is aimed at field observations and developing new models for silicic volcanism in general and these two volcanoes specifically.\r\nTo understand the controlling features of volcanic degassing at silicic domes new instrumentation, including broadband seismic and infrasonic acoustic sensors will be installed to monitor the Strombolian-type explosion activity.  The technology required to accomplish high fidelity observations, including hardware and software, will be transferred to Ecuadorian Colleagues at the Instituto Geofisica in Quito.  Elastic and acoustic energy radiation recorded with arrays of infrasonic microphones and broad-band seismometers will be used to assess the explosive energy release, relative energy partitioning into the ground and atmosphere, and explosion source location.  Digitized video records will be used to calibrate infrasound generation with gas plume ejection velocities and verify source time origin and locations.  Physical models of explosive degassing at domes will be developed and compared to lower-viscosity, open-vent magmatic systems (Stromboli, Karymsky, Arenal, Erebus), so that infrasonic and seismic tools can be used to remotely predict degassing behavior for all types of volcanic explosions. \r\n\r\nThe major impact of this proposal will be 1) the development of new volcano explosion models applied to previously unexplored volcanic activity, 2) new observations of seismo/acoustic signals at hazardous volcanoes in Ecuador, and 3) establishment of a strong collaboration between Ecuadorian and U.S. researchers on active volcanic hazard reduction, 4) assessment of hazard prior to large collapse events on dangerous volcanoes.\r\n\r\nThis project is co-sponsored by the Americas Program in the Office Of International Science And Engineering.",
