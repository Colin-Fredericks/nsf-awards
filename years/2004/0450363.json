 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rice-Houston ALLIANCE FOR GRADUATE EDUCATION AND THE PROFESSORIATE \r\n(Rice-Houston AGEP) \r\n \r\nProject Summary \r\n \r\nRice University, the University of Houston,  Texas Southern University,  the University of Houston-Downtown, Texas State University, Houston Community College, and San Jacinto  Junior College, propose an exciting new alliance, the Rice-Houston Alliance for Graduate Education and  the Professoriate (Rice-Houston AGEP).  Situated in one of the nation's largest, most culturally diverse cities, the proposed Rice-Houston AGEP unites  many of the city's research and teaching universities and community colleges in the common  mission of significantly increasing the number of underrepresented minority students earning Ph.D.s and positioning them to become leaders in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields.  The proposed Rice-Houston AGEP builds on and leverages the strengths of two highly successful programs - the Rice AGEP and the Houston Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority  Participation (H-LSAMP) - to build a unified, multi-level, long-range alliance deeply committed to this cause.  \r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish its mission, the Rice-Houston AGEP has established the following goals:   \r\n \r\nIncrease minority undergraduate retention in STEM majors to the B.S.;  \r\n\r\nPromote and motivate more minority STEM undergraduates to pursue the Ph.D.; \r\n\r\nIncrease minority STEM graduate admissions; and \r\n\r\nIncrease minority STEM graduate retention to the Ph.D.  \r\n \r\nProgram Strategies.  The Rice-Houston AGEP will accomplish its goals by building a strong \r\ncommunity of scholars across the Alliance institutions creating unique opportunities  for  all \r\nparticipating students including those from community colleges and other minority serving institutions, exposing them to the excitement of research and a career in the professoriate that they would never experience otherwise.  Through the Rice-Houston AGEP community, students will develop personal and professional relationships with peers and professors and enjoy a supportive network where they are welcomed, encouraged, and supported to pursue Ph.D.s, while mentoring others as they attain their own goals.  \r\n \r\nActivities.  Main activities within the Rice-Houston AGEP community include yearly: university faculty workshops, integrated  undergraduate and graduate summer research and mentoring programs, student  research/professional development conferences, extensive student/faculty conference attendance, and multi-institutional national and local graduate student recruitment. \r\n \r\nIntellectual  Merit.  The Rice-Houston AGEP will test several new or adapted components of its \r\nprogram.  It will examine the effects of intensive and sustained faculty  workshops on  faculty \r\ncommitment to the promotion of STEM diversity; it will evaluate the effectiveness of a university-wide, faculty-led model of program direction; it will assess program effects on broader  faculty  and institutional culture, and it will assess the impact of  multi-institutional community activities to encourage and promote STEM graduate education. \r\n \r\nBroader Impact. The Rice-Houston AGEP has the potential to impact hundreds of underrepresented minority students - encouraging, preparing, and retaining them as they pursue STEM Ph.D.s.  The Rice-Houston AGEP will provide a model for undergraduate and graduate education that effectively promotes careers in science and sustains students as they pursue careers as scientists.",
