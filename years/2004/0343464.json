 "awd_abstract_narration": "Temperature is one of the most important environmental variables affecting the survival and reproduction of organisms.  This research program aims to identify specific genes that underlie adaptation to distinct thermal regimes.  Preliminary results have shown that the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster rapidly evolves resistance to high temperature stress, and that key genes affecting this trait are located on the X chromosome. Three approaches will be used to identify the specific genes involved: 1) artificial selection at distinct temperatures, 2) fine scale molecular genetic mapping of the chromosomal regions associated with the selection response, and 3) corroboration of the mapped genes with latitudinal temperature variation in nature. Drosophila melanogaster is an ideal system for such work, offering a wealth of genetic and genomic tools.  The PI's have different areas of expertise and are collaborating on the project. \r\n\r\nThis study will demonstrate the genetic basis of adaptation to a changing climate and may offer important insights into the management of pest species as they invade new areas. This study supports research by undergraduates and the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. The PI's will offer public lectures on how scientific research links genetics with environmental issues of international concern. High school students will participate in the research through summer enhancement programs at William & Mary and at Brown.\r\n",
