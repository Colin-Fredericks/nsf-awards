In mathematics it has been known\r\nthat conformally compact Einstein manifolds provide a powerful approach to\r\nthe study of conformal geometry.  Recent development in the study of the\r\nscattering matrix in providing rather global, natural way to understand\r\nthe holography principle in physics seems very fascinating and promising. \r\nDr. Jie Qing is also interested in developing and study theory about\r\nasymptotically AdS/dS space-times. For a start, one considers static\r\nasymptotically AdS/dS space-times. The theory is not as well-known as the\r\nstudy of asymptotically flat space-times. But it is as significant, if not\r\nmore, in the classic relativity and quantum gravitation theory.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is to study the primary object in the\r\ntheory of holography principles that relate quantum gravitation theory \r\nand some conformal field theory. It has become a part the field where \r\nmathematicians and physicists can interact. It is a part of\r\nthe efforts to find a unified theory for all fundamental interactions\r\nincluding the strong and weak nuclear interactions, electromagnetism, and\r\ngravity. Advancements in this field will greatly improve our understanding\r\nof the nature in theory. The proposed research is a very important part of\r\nthe undergraduate and graduate education programs in the department of\r\nmathematics at University of California, Santa Cruz. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
