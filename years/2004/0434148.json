 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the California Polytechnic University, Pomona Noyce Scholars Program is to increase the number of qualified mathematics and science teachers, particularly those from underserved groups, serving in middle and high schools in high-need districts.  In order to accomplish this, Cal Poly Pomona is strengthening its infrastructure for recruiting STEM undergraduates, community college transfer students, and career-changers into teaching.  The objectives of the project are to prepare sixteen new credentialed mathematics and science teachers for high-need schools during the course of the grant period, as well as to have eight candidates in the pipeline by end of the grant period.  All of the Noyce Scholars are obtaining a single-subject teaching credential and begin teaching in a high-need district.\r\n\r\nThe program focuses on three major types of activities: recruitment, retention, and support of the Noyce Scholars.  Recruitment focuses on current Cal Poly Pomona STEM students, STEM students from community colleges who will transfer to Cal Poly Pomona, and STEM professionals.  These recruitment activities attract those who might otherwise not have considered the teaching profession, particularly those from underrepresented groups. Retention and support activities include early field experience, monthly seminars, active academic advising, and on-line discussion groups for the cohort of Noyce Scholars.  These research-based retention strategies ensure that Noyce Scholars successfully obtain their bachelor's degrees and/or single-subject teaching credentials. With coordinated support from Cal Poly Pomona and three high-need districts, Noyce Scholars refine their teaching skills while completing two years of teaching in high-need middle and high schools.  \r\n",
