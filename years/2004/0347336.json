 "awd_abstract_narration": "Animal behavior is greatly influenced by sensory inputs to the brain. For example, \"olfactory\" or smell neurons in the nose send signals to the brain where odors are perceived and acted upon. Sensory pathways can be influenced by neurons in the body or brain that reflect the animal's physiological condition. The \"terminal nerve\" in the nose secretes a sex hormone (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) onto olfactory neurons. Experiments in this laboratory have shown that the hormone alters odor detection at the cellular level. What controls the secretion of the hormone from the terminal nerve is still unknown. These experiments will investigate whether pheromones increase GnRH gene expression and/or production in the terminal nerve and whether these changes are mediated through olfactory brain centers. This project will incorporate an array of procedures including molecular-biological, biochemical and neural-activity techniques in the salamander model, Plethodon shermani. Alterations in olfactory-receptor-neuron activity in the presence of GnRH are expected. This work will help to show how hormones can modulate sensory systems, thus giving us a much better understanding of animal behavior.\r\n\r\nThe educational plan is to involve underrepresented minority students and teachers (Native American Indian, African-American and Mexican-American) in conducting research and in engaging the community in neuroscience. Students and teachers will participate in research, in developing Website and teaching materials, and in giving neuroscience workshops and seminars in secondary schools and outlying communities and interacting with international colleagues. The broad impact will be to (1) integrate research, teaching, and community outreach activities for students, (2) make available scientific and program information on the Internet, by public communications and to international colleagues, and (3) present our scientific knowledge to disadvantaged communities located at a distance from institutions of higher education.",
