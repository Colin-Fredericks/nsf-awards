 "awd_abstract_narration": "This comprehensive ITEST project would provide sixty middle and high school teachers with an introduction to Geographic Information System (GIS) and Global Positioning System (GPS) technologies.  The project, which brings together a leadership team of educators, science researchers and experts in resource management, is based at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Appalachian Laboratory, a research facility that studies stream and forest ecosystems.  The program will focus on environmental applications in which teachers use probes to investigate the properties of local forest and stream ecosystems.  Teachers will apply their technology experiences to creating standards based lessons aligned with local curricula.  The teacher participants will be recruited from rural, underserved Appalachian communities in western Maryland and northern West Virginia.  Local students will be recruited to participate in a four-day summer session that includes field-testing the proposed lessons and learning about career opportunities in information technology",
