 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most organisms exhibit senescence, the physiological deterioration with age that ultimately limits life span.  The rate of senescence and life span are highly variable among species, populations, and individuals, and a large body of data suggests that these traits are under some level of genetic control.   Identification of the genes that produce this variation is important for understanding both the causes and evolution of aging.  A series of gene mapping experiments is proposed to identify and characterize the effects of candidate genes for these traits, using the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model system.  The flies used for mapping will be derived from a natural population.  The effects of natural genetic variation on these traits will reveal the extent to which they are influenced by similar genetic pathways.\r\n\r\nThis project will make several contributions to the broader scientific community.  Identification of genes involved in senescence in Drosophila could implicate new gene networks in human aging, and thus have important medical implications.  All fly stocks and sequence data will be made freely available to other scientists.  Students will be educated about the mechanistic and evolutionary theories of aging while gaining hands-on experience in quantitative and molecular genetics, experimental design and data analysis.\r\n",
