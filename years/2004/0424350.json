 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF-supported University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) Materials Research Science and Engineering Center  (MRSEC) on Nanostructured  Materials  and  Interfaces  and  the  Discovery  World  (DW)  science museum  in  Milwaukee,  WI,  carry out  a  collaborative  Internships  in  Public  Science  Education  (IPSE) program that has three fundamental goals:  \r\n \r\n1)  to  focus  on  intern  professional  development  and  create  future  leaders  in  science  communication who can bridge the increasing gap between science and the public;  \r\n2)  to develop effective museum exhibits and digital visual media about nanotechnology; and  \r\n3)  to improve public science literacy by using cutting-edge nanotechnology research to explain core science concepts.   \r\n \r\nThrough the UW IPSE program, a diverse group of graduate students from all disciplines teams with UW MRSEC researchers and DW personnel to develop their science communication skills while simultaneously developing and assessing their team projects.  These two-person projects consist of either a short educational video or a prototype museum exhibit.  In addition to national impact, these products also contribute to DW's new building to open in 2006 or 2007.  The program impacts about 20 graduate students who, through developing their interpersonal science communication skills, their technical understanding about nanotechnology, their knowledge about their team project medium, and their assessment skills, have an exceptional professional development experience while working to increase public understanding of science and nanotechnology.   In addition, interns have the opportunity to earn a science education certificate through their project and completion of courses on science education. In turn, the interns' outreach efforts and team project products affect tens of thousands individuals each year through museum events, professional workshops, public events, video dissemination, and museum exhibits. \r\n\r\n",
