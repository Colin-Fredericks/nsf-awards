 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Title:  Research in Ring Theory and Noncommutative Algebraic\r\nGeometry\r\n\r\nPrincipal Investigator:  K. R. Goodearl\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator proposes to continue his investigations\r\ninto the structure of various classes of noncommutative rings,\r\nparticularly quantum coordinate rings (quantized algebras of\r\nfunctions) and related algebras, with a focus on geometric aspects of\r\nnoncommutative rings and ring-theoretic aspects of noncommutative\r\nalgebraic geometry. The proposed projects, located within\r\nnoncommutative algebra, will build up the infrastructure of and\r\ninterconnections among active parts of several related areas -- ring\r\ntheory, noncommutative algebraic geometry, and quantum groups. Roughly\r\nspeaking, the long-term goals framing many of these projects stem from\r\nnoncommutative algebraic geometry, and the basic examples come from\r\nquantum groups, while many lines of approach are recruited from ring\r\ntheory. The main focus will be on algebraic and geometric features of\r\nthe prime and primitive spectra of quantized coordinate rings. The\r\ngoals include classification of prime ideals, finiteness conditions\r\nfor prime ideals invariant under tori of automorphisms, verification of\r\nsupporting properties such as Auslander-regularity and\r\nCohen-Macaulayness, and presentations of quantized prime or primitive\r\nspectra as topological quotients of classical spectra or varieties.\r\n\r\nA pervasive theme in the mathematical study of geometric objects is\r\nthat the properties of these objects are completely encoded in the\r\nfunctions on them, and are often more accessible via these functions\r\nthan directly. Within algebraic geometry -- the study of geometric\r\nspaces defined by polynomial equations -- it is the polynomial\r\nfunctions on a space that determine it. These functions form a ring (a\r\nsystem endowed with compatible addition and multiplication operations)\r\nwhich is, moreover, commutative (fg = gf always). In the 1980s,\r\nresearchers in the former Soviet Union, in the process of solving\r\ncertain problems in theoretical quantum physics, discovered rings\r\nwhich appear to enjoy all the structure of rings of functions on\r\ngeometric spaces, except that the multiplication is noncommutative. In\r\nhonor of their origins in quantum theory, these rings are now called\r\n\"quantized coordinate rings.\" It proved very useful to treat them as\r\nif they were rings of functions (except for the noncommutativity), and\r\nthe guiding principle in their study became the search for\r\n\"noncommutative versions of the geometry.\" Sufficiently many common\r\nphenomena (both geometric and algebraic) have been discovered in a wide\r\nrange of quantized coordinate rings to lead one to conjecture that\r\ngeneral, axiomatizable underpinnings within this class of rings are\r\nresponsible for the parallels in their behavior. The main long-term\r\nthrust of the PI's research is to uncover such general structures and\r\ndecode their geometric content. In the medium term, the proposal aims\r\nto extend the range of known shared phenomena within this class of\r\nrings, in order to gain better insight into their common base.\r\n",
