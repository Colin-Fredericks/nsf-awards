With NSF support, LeMoyne-Owen College will (1) improve student skills in mathematics, communication, and the physical sciences by offering pre-freshman summer programs and tutoring associated with STEM gatekeeper courses; (2) revise the STEM curriculum to promote active learning; (3) provide on-site and off-site undergraduate research experiences as well as industry internships; (3) provide faculty professional development opportunities; and (4) provide other student-centered academic enrichment activities to prepare students for graduate study and success in the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nProposed efforts build on and will coordinate with academic enhancement strategies developed as part of the NSF supported Mid-South Alliance for Minority Participation Program.  Proven effective practices are also incorporated from the Environmental Protection Agency funded Storm Water Environmental Education Program.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the proposed STEM infrastructure enhancements and their potential to result in significant and sustainable improvements in the overall quality of STEM instruction at the institution.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the proposed efforts is to broaden the participation of under-represented minorities in STEM disciplines and the national STEM workforce.  \r\n",
