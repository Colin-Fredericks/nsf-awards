 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to understand how social forces operating at individual and collective levels shape scholarship.  Specifically, it will consider relationships between gender, life course effects, and institutional mechanisms, and how they affect criminological knowledge.  It derives from earlier NSF-funded research which content analyzed 1,612 articles on crime in leading journals.  The proposed project will survey authors of the original dataset and additional scholars to supplement the article dataset with an author dataset (N=1,500).  Pilot in-depth interviews with prominent criminologists inform the construction of a survey instrument.  The proposed research involves additional interviews, particularly with female criminologists. Beyond intellectual gains for the sociology of knowledge, ideas, gender, and criminology, broader impacts are expected as findings may inform strategies of enhancing the status of women in academia and in advancing understanding of academia-practice links.",
