 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an extension and enhancement of the ongoing workshops organized and supported by the Center for Workshops in the Chemical Sciences. Information on the Center is available at http://chemistry.gsu.edu/cwcs. \r\n\r\nFor 2004-2007, the Center has established a consortium of 17 institutions and companies to host 9 or 10 five-day workshops each year.  These workshops provide faculty with resources and perspectives to enhance their teaching in chemistry at the undergraduate level. The goals of the program are to augment and upgrade knowledge, integrate chemistry and biochemistry with other disciplines, illustrate emerging fields derived from research, and develop approaches to integrate workshop materials into the undergraduate curriculum. To meet these goals, each workshop consists of five days of faculty development, including extensive hands-on activities. \r\n\r\nThe choice and level of workshop topics is driven by participant needs, established by an on-going comprehensive evaluation program that also assesses the extent to which workshop materials are used in the curriculum.  An Advisory Committee provides feedback on program activities. To maximize attendance, the diversity in workshops' intellectual content is complemented by geographically diverse workshop sites, including EPSCoR locations and HBCU institutions. A vigorous recruitment program emphasizes reaching underrepresented groups. The program is designed to serve over 400 participants, producing a network of instructors who use workshop materials to teach more than 40,000 students each year.\r\n",
