Ercolani\r\n\r\nThis proposal is for support of junior US based mathematicians to\r\nparticipate in scientific activities at the Fields Institute\r\nduring the thematic program semester in Nonlinear Waves, Kinetic\r\nTheory and Hamiltonian Partial Differential Equations (PDE) that\r\nwill take place during the Spring semester of 2004. The focus of\r\nthe semester will concern areas of research on PDE that are\r\nmotivated by nonlinear wave theory, kinetic theory, and\r\nHamiltonian systems. Hamiltonian PDE form a class of linear and\r\nnonlinear partial differential equations which share the property\r\nthat they can be written in the form of a Hamiltonian system with\r\ninfinitely many degrees of freedom, using various and sometimes\r\nnonclassical symplectic structures. Principal examples include\r\nnonlinear wave equations, nonlinear Schroedinger equations and\r\nEuler's equations for water waves. The analogy with dynamical\r\nsystems raises a number of basic questions, which form a part of\r\nthe motivation for this semester of focus on Hamiltonian PDE. Of\r\nparticular note is the connection that has been established\r\nbetween the theory of kinetic equations coming from statistical\r\nmechanics, and the nonlinear systems of PDE which arise in their\r\nmacroscopic limits. The paradigm is the fluid dynamical scaling\r\nlimit of the Boltzmann equation, but there are numerous emerging\r\nareas of relevance for this analysis, including the beginnings of\r\na mathematically rigorous foundation for the theory of nonlinear\r\nwave turbulence.\r\n\r\nThe organizers are expecting this thematic program to be a very\r\ndynamic focus of research on Partial Differential Equations that\r\nmodel a variety of physical phenomena, such as planetary motions,\r\nlasers and optical fiber systems, ocean waves and fluid\r\nturbulence. The character of the program is broadly\r\ninternational, and it represents an opportunity for exposure for\r\nyoung mathematicians. The short course series, the four workshops\r\nand the symposia are especially appropriate for participation by\r\ndeveloping research mathematicians or physicists early in their\r\ncareer. The organizing committee believes that the program will\r\nengender further interaction and lasting collaboration among\r\nparticipants from various disciplines. Additionally, the\r\nparticipation of women and under-represented minorities will be\r\nactively encouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
