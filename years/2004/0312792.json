 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on interfaces between liquid crystals (LC) and solid substrates exhibiting a variety of behaviors such as orientational wetting, spreading, memory effects, and anchoring transitions near and far from bulk phase transitions. The goal of the research is to understand surface driven phenomena that have origins in nanoscale organization at the interface of an organic material and the liquid crystal. Experimental techniques such as glancing incidence synchrotron x-ray diffraction, x-ray reflectivity, atomic force and confocal microscopies, and electro-optical measurements will be used to study the nanoscale structure and structural transitions at model interfaces to determine how the underlying interfacial nano-structure affects the anchoring of nematic liquid crystals. Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars will be trained in the use of sophisticated facilities and instrumentation while acquiring interdisciplinary scientific knowledge through interactions with researchers from other fields. In addition, high school science teachers will be educated about various issues related to LC phases that are so ubiquitous in nature.\r\n%%%\r\nSurfaces and surface energetics play an important role in processes ranging from common  wetting, to more sophisticated phenomena such as adhesion, liquid crystal alignment, surface memory effects, and non-coalescence of identical fluids. Empirical knowledge of surface phenomena has led to a number of technologically important applications such as the liquid crystal flat panel display (LCDs), smart glue used in medicine, and highly sensitive bio-sensors. \r\n\r\nUndergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and high school teachers (during the summer) will acquire training in the use of advanced experimental techniques at local, national, and international facilities where they will also closely interact with scientists from different disciplines and countries. Because these materials research areas are of high interest to industry, the students trained on this NSF funded project will compete very effectively in the job market.\r\n",
