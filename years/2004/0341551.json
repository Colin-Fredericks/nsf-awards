 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21) This proof-of-concept project is developing short video clips explaining how to do selected homework problems covering the primary topics covered in introductory calculus. These clips are intended to supplement traditional forms of support such as tutorials and recitation sessions with particular attention to reducing the percentage of unsuccessful students (D/F/Withdraw) taking calculus. The digital incarnation of these clips promotes wide accessibility and reuse. From the learner's perspective the clips also offer multiple opportunities for viewing and reviewing. To manage this collection of clips an XML/DTD management system is being constructed to allow publication to a variety of media, in multiple formats. Both web and DVD based dissemination is being undertaken along with a comprehensive evaluation program to determine the effectiveness of these initial clips. This project also offers a model for helping potentially unsuccessful students in other math and science courses.",
