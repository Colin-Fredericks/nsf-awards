Rinaldi, University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez\r\n\r\nThe proposed research concerns experimental and theoretical studies of the synthesis and rheological response of novel magnetically active complex fluids. Such fluids include colloidal dispersions of magnetizable micro-particles (1-100micrometers) and permanently magnetized nanoparticles (1-100nm). Experimental efforts will focus on synthesis of said dispersions, with particular emphasis on stability, controllability of particle size, tailoring of magnetic properties, functionalization of particle surfaces, and characterization of the corresponding magnetorheological response to alternating, traveling-wave, and rotating uniform/non-uniform electromagnetic fields.  Theoretical research will focus on formulation of proper balance laws, constitutive equations, boundary conditions, and analytical/numerical solution schemes for the associated coupled electromechanical fluid-flow problems. This research-initiation grant will enable support of graduate students over the summer months, principal investigator travel to professional meetings and conferences, and acquisition of raw materials and supplies. The ultimate goal of the proposed work is the establishment of an externally funded research laboratory focusing on smart complex fluids at the Chemical Engineering Department of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in the elucidation of proper constitutive forms for the stress and other phenomenological fluxes in the continuum description of smart complex fluids.  This has immediate application in the description of magnetic fluids  (ferrofluids) and of magnetorheological fluids. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The requested funds will support junior faculty from an underrepresented group in the startup of a research laboratory.  The research proposed will serve to substantiate future proposals to external funding agencies. Funds acquired will enhance the Puerto Rico research infrastructure and develop the local workforce by fostering the growth of the recently established Ph.D. program in Chemical Engineering at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez, one of the nations leading Hispanic Serving Institutions producing graduates in science, mathematics, and engineering.  \r\n",
