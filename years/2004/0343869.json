 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nThis project will continue an in-depth exploration of two organisms that\r\nhave lived together for many millions of years, namely chewing lice (a group\r\nof parasitic insects) and their mammalian hosts (pocket gophers).  Previous\r\nstudies of this host-parasite system by the PI and colleagues have provided\r\nnew insights into how organisms live in long-term symbiosis and has advanced\r\nour knowledge of rates of molecular change in insects versus mammals.  This\r\nproject will take a new and different approach to host-parasite studies by\r\nanalyzing cospeciation at a previously unexplored scale augmented by use of\r\nGIS (Geographic Information Systems) technology. Analysis of cophylogeny\r\n(parallel speciation in the hosts and parasites) will use DNA sequences from\r\nboth nuclear and mitochondrial genes. Recently developed methods will be\r\nused to compare rates of molecular evolution among genes, genomes, and\r\nspecies to identify gene-specific, genome-specific, and lineage-specific\r\nrate differences. GIS technology will be used to develop and test predictive\r\ndistribution models (3ecological niche models2) for each species of pocket\r\ngopher and each species of louse examined in this study. Finally, this\r\nproject will establish Louisiana State University (LSU) as an active node in\r\nthe worldwide louse database (LouseBase), into which will be deposited all\r\nlouse data generated in the course of this research.\r\n\r\nData generated in the PI's studies of the gopher-louse system continue to be\r\nused widely in development of analytical methods and software for analysis\r\nof host-parasite systems (e.g., Huelsenbeck & Rannala, 1997; Huelsenbeck et\r\nal., 1997; and the programs COMPONENT and TREEMAP developed by Roderic\r\nPage).  This work has also been featured in at least 8 books and textbooks,\r\nincluding Parasitology (Noble et al., 1989), A Functional Biology of\r\nParasitism (Esch  & Fernandez, 1993), and Evolution (Ridley, 1996). Thus,\r\nthis work has reached a large number of graduate and undergraduate students.\r\nThe proposed project has an explicit plan to involve students as\r\ncollaborators in the research.  This includes undergraduates, graduates, and\r\npostdocs at LSU, collaborators and their graduate students in Mexico, and\r\nundergraduate students at the University of Northern Iowa (UNI), which is a\r\nsubcontractor on this project.  Students at UNI will be trained in the\r\nfundamental, yet rapidly disappearing, skills of parasite taxonomy and\r\nidentification, insect microscopy, and use of the digital microscopy imaging\r\nsystem for specimen documentation and morphological analysis. Students will\r\nalso be exposed to the total breadth of the proposed research program\r\nthrough intensive, 10-day, summer workshops in the molecular lab at LSU.\r\nThese workshops will not only train the students in the molecular techniques\r\ninvolved with the proposed research, but will also expose them to the\r\nworkings of a larger research laboratory. This kind of exposure and\r\nexperience is essential to encourage quality students to pursue careers in\r\nnon-medical basic research.",
