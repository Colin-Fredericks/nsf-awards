Her outreach activities serve students from K-12 through graduate education with additional attention to mentoring junior faculty.  Her goals include doing more intensive outreach to women faculty and the continued mentoring of women in STEM learning communities. She has built an array of program activities that seek to stop leaks in the academic pipeline for women and students from traditionally under-represented groups.  Grant notes that the most important aspect of the mentoring process is to teach students how to work in the system.  The letters of support suggest that she \"walks the talk\" and includes students in her research agenda. \r\n",
