 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to investigate the interaction of moist deep convection with mesoscale processes via new methods of initiating convection.  The intent of this work is to investigate more realistic forcing from mesoscale processes on time scales that are much longer than the convective time scale with the goal of capturing the interaction between mesoscale forcing and convection.  Specifically, the project team will investigate and observe the effects of several key environmental factors on the updraft and convective regeneration cycle of numerically simulated convection.  The project team will apply, within a three-dimensional numerical cloud model, two initiating mechanisms, a constant near surface heat source and a momentum flux source within a non-dimensional parameter range study.  These methods provide a continuous source of vertical motion that is consistent with environmental conditions commonly observed with organized convection.  The results will be used to further classify and understand isolated multicellular thunderstorms.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  With the aid of powerful parallel computers and a sophisticated efficient parallel numerical cloud model, the project team will enhance the state of knowledge associated with isolated multicell thunderstorm behavior.  The team will apply the model in a novel way, using simplified momentum and heat flux sources to simulate mesoscale forcing, to reveal basic convective updraft characteristics such as updraft regeneration and the interaction with the persistent mesoscale forcing as a function of environmental factors.  Another key innovation is the application of the model with and without complicating precipitation physics, allowing the project team to isolate the interaction between persistent mesoscale ascent and the cumulus cloud updrafts.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  Relatively isolated multicell storms are an important element in the spectrum of deep, moist convection and can produce severe weather, including strong winds, large hail and heavy rainfall.  This work will simulate such storms, in an idealized fashion, using a persistent mesoscale source for ascent, which is hypothesized to interact with the convection to produce isolated multicellular storms.  With an understanding of the causes for such storm organization and an exploration of the parameters governing their behavior, the project team can fill a large gap in the understanding of deep, moist convective storms.  The results could later be applied to improve thunderstorm prediction.  The research team provides a unique mix of theoretical, observational, numerical and computational experience for use in structuring the graduate student's exposure to convective storm research.  The results of the effort will be translated into the research community via formal publications and presentations and into the educational community through a graduate level course taught by the principal investigator.",
