They plan to meet with a number of U.S. potential participants in an interdisciplinary research and education agenda in the area of Human Language Technology.  The technology will be applied to English and Arabic dialects, and possibly to indigenous languages as well.  Soudi has done recent interesting work in natural language processing, and has visited laboratories in the United States and Britain, and the projects undertaken during those visits have been successful.  The scientists intend to use the results in undergraduate and graduate education.  Advances in human language technology would of course have broader impact on the way people use computers in everyday life.  Advances in Arabic language processing are long overdue. \r\n\r\nScope:  This award will allow the Moroccan scientist to visit the U.S. P.I. and his U.S. colleagues, who come from a variety of backgrounds.  These various backgrounds are potentially useful for the planned research on the subject of human language technology.   Dr. Soudi and Dr. Monaco have had previous contacts, and have jointly submitted one conference paper.  They plan to obtain widespread involvement and commitment of other individuals in this region as envisioned in this project and to iron out the details of the research collaboration through face-to-face meetings.\r\n",
