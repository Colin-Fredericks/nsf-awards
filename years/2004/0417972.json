 "awd_abstract_narration": "The properties of groundwater aquifers are uncertain at almost all\r\nphysical locations.  Only a small fraction of an aquifer can be sampled\r\nand tested.  Some statistical model must be chosen and implemented that\r\ndescribes the distribution and correlation structure of the parameters\r\n(primarily the hydraulic conductivity) that control the motion of\r\ngroundwater and dissolved pollutants.  Based on the statistical model,\r\nreplicas of the aquifers are constructed to make predictions of flow and\r\ntransport.  These replicas must contain the structures that may be\r\npresent across all scales of interest.  The replicas should honor the\r\nreal data where measured (including a possibly non-Gaussian\r\ndistribution), and should represent correlation that might be restricted\r\nto very narrow directional windows; for example, discrete fracture set\r\norientations.  The investigators are working on one model that can honor\r\nthe data from many well-studied aquifers (granular and/or fractured). \r\nThe model uses operator-fractional noise and motions, since the scaling,\r\nor fractal, properties of aquifers vary with direction.  The operator\r\nfractional motions are based on the investigators' recent definitions of\r\n3-D fractional integro-differentiation.  The operator-fractional motions\r\nhave what is known in the earth sciences as \"generalized scale\r\ninvariance\" in which the index of scaling depends on direction.  The\r\ninvestigators are rigorously defining the mathematical properties of\r\nthese motions and their numerical implementations.  They are also\r\nstudying the correspondence between transport through the\r\noperator-fractional aquifer replicas and simple analytic descriptions of\r\ntransport embodied in fractional-order transport equations and\r\ngeneralized continuous time random walks.\r\n \r\nThe spreading of pollution in an aquifer is controlled by sediment\r\nstructures that are present across a huge range of scales.  Tiny bits of\r\nsilt and clay may retain pollutants for years, while buried (remnant)\r\ngravelly stream channels might move some pollutants for miles in a short\r\ntime.  To make realistic predictions of drinking water vulnerability or\r\neventual cleanup, it is important to construct models of aquifers that\r\nhave this kind of multi-scale structure.  In another setting more\r\ngermane to nuclear waste storage, the simultaneous presence of small and\r\nlarge fractures will account for both the slow and fast pathways for the\r\nspreading of radioactivity away from future repositories. \r\nRepresentative models of these aquifers must be \"buildable\" and\r\ntestable, so the investigators are first pouring a concrete mathematical\r\nfooting.  While the work deals primarily with mathematics and hydrology,\r\nthe results also contribute to applied studies in physics, fluid\r\ndynamics, electrical engineering, and finance.  The financial\r\napplications are revealed when looking at a graph of a stock price:\r\nthere are minute-to-minute fluctuations that are similar to year-to-year\r\ngains and losses. Some stocks are tightly coupled; others are not. Not\r\nall markets respond at the same rate, nor are the magnitudes of the\r\nchanges easily characterized.  Finally, several graduate students and a\r\npost-doctoral researcher are also supported by the grant.  Each of them\r\nis receiving extensive training in both physical sciences and\r\nmathematics.  This cross-training engenders more fruitful cooperation\r\nbetween the theoretical and applied sciences. \r\n",
