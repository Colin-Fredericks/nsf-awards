 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the ocean autotrophs are the principle particle vector converting dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) \r\nto particulate organic matter (POM).   Exudates, principally derived from phytoplankton as dissolved \r\norganic matter (DOM), exist in the ocean as labile, semi-labile and refractory DOM.  As an alternate \r\nparticulate pathway the microbial loop represents a process where bacteria are able to metabolize a \r\nportion of this DOM and therefore convert DOM to POM.  This conversion of DOM to POM has \r\nbeen found to be substantial, providing significant energy for higher trophic levels.  Recently, a \r\nprocess has been described where 0.2 um filtered and poisoned river water produced particles \r\nabiotically in dark incubations.  The analysis of particles and source waters showed that the particles \r\nare distinctly different from TEP (transparent exopolymers particles) and were derived from DOM \r\nand contained organic components found in living organisms (i.e., DNA, carbohydrates, lipids, \r\nproteins).  Over the incubation period the rate and magnitude of formation, as well as size, of these \r\nabiotic microparticles were similar to bacteria, and carbon-nitrogen ratios suggest they could be \r\nnutritionally important.  If a similar process occurs in the marine environment it would by-pass the \r\ntraditional biotic microbial loop in terms of transforming DOM to POM and may constitute an \r\nimportant alternate pathway, especially if labile DOM comprise major components of the abiotic \r\nparticle formation pathway.  However, if the source material of the microparticles are composed \r\nprimarily of the refractory fraction of the DOM pool then they may provide a poor nutritional source, \r\nbut may still make a significant contribution to the deep sea carbon flux.   \r\n \r\nThe proposed study will examine the abiotic formation of organic particles in two major contrasting \r\nocean environments: the oligotrophic North Pacific near Station ALOHA and the highly productive \r\nupwelling zone off the Pacific coast of N. America (cruise of opportunity).  Carefully controlled \r\ntime-series experimental incubations will be conducted with filtered and poisoned surface (1% light \r\nlevel) and deep (~1000 m) seawater to elucidate the formation rate, size, quantity, composition and \r\nnutritional quality of abiotically formed particles as well as a determination of source material.   \r\nIntellectual Merit: The results of this research will provide a first-order global estimate of the \r\nmagnitude of this process in the sea and its significance relative to the traditional microbial loop \r\npathway.  If the abiotic formation of organic particles is a significant process in the sea, then this \r\nprocess could be a significant shunt to the microbial loop and would expand our understanding of \r\nparticle dynamics in the sea. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts: There is a strong educational benefit to these studies. Undergraduate students will \r\nbe intimately involved in the planning and implementation of this project, and will benefit from \r\nexposure to interdisciplinary faculty from UH and other institutions involved with HOTs and other \r\ncruises (informal education in the form of dissemination of ideas, techniques and field experience).  \r\nProject PI Cowen is a faculty member of the Global Environmental Sciences, a rigorous \r\nundergraduate science major administered through the Department of Oceanography; it is anticipated \r\nthat undergraduate participation in this project will lead to at least one student Senior Thesis.  Cowen \r\nis also involved in Science-Teacher outreach projects and will continue the very successful .Teacher \r\nat Sea. outreach program initiated by Cowen as part of another NSF project; this program integrates \r\nlocal teachers and their classrooms into all phases of the research project; in this project we will \r\ninvolve teachers in the local sample collections, incubation experiments and analyses.  Teachers. \r\nstudents will be invited to UH ships and to analytical facilities for examination of project samples.   \r\n\r\n",
