 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research focuses on the estimation of velocity, density, and\r\nflow fields from video recordings of freeway traffic, using data\r\nfrom the Berkeley Highway laboratory, which has recorded thousands\r\nof hours of traffic flow on freeway I-80.  The investigators are \r\nparticularly\r\nconcerned with recordings which are not sufficiently well resolved\r\nto allow unambiguous vehicle identification and tracking.\r\nThey propose to investigate two broad classes of methods.  The\r\nfirst, building on an initially encouraging approach, is based\r\nupon local semiparametric statistical modelling of the velocity\r\nfield.  The second is based upon simulation using microscopic\r\nmodels.  Both of these present challenges for the development of\r\nstatistical methodology and theory.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts include: the development of effective, practical\r\nmethods for video surveillance of traffic, which would be of\r\nwidespread utility;  the compilation of a large empirical body of\r\nvelocity fields, which will be a valuable resource for researchers\r\nin traffic flow theory; extension of the methodology to the more\r\ngeneral problem of estimating optical flow in two dimensions,\r\nwhich has widespread applications in computer vision; and the\r\ninvolvement of undergraduates and graduate students in research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
