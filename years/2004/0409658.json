 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2004. The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients.   It is expected that Fellows supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"An NMR system to study conformational communication in SecA, the enzymatic motor subunit of a complex protein translocation machine.\"  Bacteria use the Sec translocation machinery to move proteins into and across the cell membrane.  Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a technique that allows one to visualize how different parts of molecules move relative to one another.  The goal is to use NMR spectroscopy to examine how motor (SecA) movements result in protein movement through membranes.\r\n\r\nThe training goals are to broaden skills in structural biology, learn enzymology, and improve interpersonal and project management skills; all are essential for achieving the professional goal to establish a research and teaching program at an academic institution that serves minorities.\r\n",
