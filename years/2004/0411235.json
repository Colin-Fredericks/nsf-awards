 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering-Mechanical (56)  This Adaptation and Implementation project is improving the effectiveness of laboratory exercises by adapting the use of a haptic paddle (a device that allows users to interact via a sense of touch with virtual environments) in a mechanical engineering modeling dynamic systems course. The project is using the successful Haptic Paddle Laboratory series developed at Stanford University and currently used in undergraduate courses at John Hopkins University. \r\n\r\nThis project is: (1) Improving cohesiveness of course and lab content to deepen student conceptual understanding of system dynamics concepts; (2) Demonstrating that haptic virtual learning increases student's ability to apply conceptual knowledge to real-world systems, and (3) Improving understanding of critical system dynamics topics in a cost-effective way.\r\n\r\nStudents are investigating how the haptic paddle can serve as a real electromechanical system with known parameters and how to use the haptic paddle as a tool to interact with virtual mechanical systems using LabView, Matlab simulations, and system interfacing. \r\n\r\nThe project is demonstrating how the materials can be applied to a required course that is present in most undergraduate mechanical engineering curricula.  Collaboration with colleagues, including faculty at a neighboring institution at the University of Houston that serves a substantial number of Hispanic students, is demonstrating the effectiveness of the lab series in teaching system modeling and system dynamics concepts to underrepresented classes of students. The dissemination plan includes presentation of a method that demonstrates how to adapt and improve the Haptic Paddle Laboratory series.  \r\n\r\nThese multi-sensory labs are closely tied to course concepts. Assessment of student learning, and the effectiveness of the outreach activities to the University of Houston and prospective Rice students are embedded throughout the project. \r\n",
