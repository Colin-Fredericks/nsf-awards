 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program provides scholarship awards to students who are enrolled in programs leading to the Associate Degree in Computer Technology (CT) or Information Systems Technology (IST).  The project is particularly focused on recruiting current high school students completing an IT pathway or who have earned a grade of B or higher in one of the IST or CT Running Start (dual enrollment) courses.  \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit:  The project objectives are (1) to provide scholarships to academically talented, financially disadvantaged students; (2) to increase the number of students in IT programs or Project Running Start courses in high school enrolling directly into associate degree programs in Computer Science by 50%; (3) to provide support to NEXT STEP scholars that enable a minimum of 70% to complete first semester math and English courses with a grade of C or better and persist to achievement of an associate degree (4) to develop at least ten new internship sites for second year CSEMS students. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The project increases the number of students pursuing career in information technology and can be used as a benchmark for other institutions offering similar programs. Support for the success and retention of these scholars includes new advising models that are being integrated into the college by the acquisition of a recent Title III grant, and requirement of mathematics summer remediation if placement tests show there is a need.   \r\n",
