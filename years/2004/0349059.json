 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program support Professor Timothy Dore of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Georgia in a research program that seeks to develop new photochemical technology to study biological function.  Light sensitive organic molecules will be designed, synthesized, and attached to biological effectors (such as a neurotransmitter, hormone, DNA, RNA, or other bioactive messenger) in order to inactivate or \"cage\" the effector until a flash of light releases or \"uncages\" it in its biologically active form.  If the light source is a pulsed IR laser and multiphoton excitation (MPE, a special non-linear optical process) occurs, then the timing and location of the effector release can be carefully controlled, allowing the study of temporal and spatial requirements for biologically important events.  The outcome of many physiological processes often depends on the timing of the event and the immediate local environment.  The technology developed will be used to regulate protein synthesis, control gene expression, and engineer cell surfaces in order to study a variety of biological processes.  The educational plan aims to bridge the gap between undergraduate and graduate science programs, demystifying the process of doctoral education, and thereby encourage undergraduate science majors to pursue a Ph.D.  A series of seminars and multimedia programs for undergraduate and new graduate students will highlight the exciting career paths of doctorate recipients and provide them with practical information for navigating the process.  \r\n\r\nWith the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Dore will demonstrate that the broader impacts of this work lie in its multidisciplinary nature and focus on developing human resources in science.  The research will enable less invasive methods of studying cellular function and impact biological disciplines in the sub-areas of cell and developmental biology, genetics, neuroscience, microscopy, biochemistry, and biotechnology.  The research is an excellent medium to train students to become outstanding scholars with a depth of understanding of photo- and organic chemistry and a breadth of scientific knowledge.  The programs on doctoral education are targeted at underrepresented groups in science, seeking to improve their chances of success in graduate programs.  They also aim to increase the number of students who pursue careers in science and science-related areas, helping to fulfill a national need for human resources in the sciences.\r\n",
