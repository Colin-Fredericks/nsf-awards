 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal award by the Division of Materials Research to University of Maryland College Park is to study the dispersion of the shear elastic isotropy and magnetic properties in the high temperature phase of ferromagnetic shape memory alloys (FSMAs), where tweed has been observed or is likely to occur.  With this award, Professor Wuttig will be experimentally investigating the structural origin of the elastic dispersion in FSMAs, particularly Fe\"70Pd\"30, by time resolved diffraction studies at a bright X-ray source operated by national facilities.  Complete temperature and magnetic field dependence of the real and imaginary parts of all elastic constants in the cubic phase of magnetic shape memory alloys of interest will also be determined, and these studies will be augmented with structural information.  These experiments would provide the input parameters for modeling that would promote an overall understanding of the elasticity and anelasticity as well as related magnetic response functions of the alloys of interest.\r\n\r\nWith the cooperation of one of Maryland's premier science magnet high schools, the project would attempt to enhance the image of engineering sciences in general and materials science in particular among students.  The planned activities include: a) creating role model(s) by working with one or two students on aspects of this project, and b) nurturing them so that they will be able to write a scientific papers and prepare them to compete well in the Intel competition. One of the outcomes of these activities would be increased enrollment of students in undergraduate engineering programs.\r\n",
