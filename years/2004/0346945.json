 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nCAREER: Capacity and Ubiquity in Multitier Wireless Networks\r\nAbstract\r\nTo meet diverse communication requirements of users, wireless systems must\r\nsimultaneously support wide-area access (ubiquity) and local area performance\r\n(capacity). Multitiered wireless networks represent a natural design option that fulfills\r\nthese joint goals. These networks contain radios designed with coverage areas that vary\r\nin their order of magnitude. Higher-tier radios, which have larger coverage, extend the\r\nnetwork's reach while lower-tier radios target location-specific performance. This\r\nresearch studies the capacity and ubiquity supported by various multitier networks. As a\r\ndemonstration of the benefits offered by such systems, topographic and demographic data\r\nfor Susquehanna County, a rural and technology-poor county in Northern Pennsylvania,\r\nwill be used to implement derived results and to devise a multitier network for that\r\nregion. This design will take into consideration the extremely hilly propagation\r\ncharacteristics of the area; location of population centers; and communication\r\nrequirements at these locations in order to better serve the needs of the county (e.g.,\r\nprovide satisfactory cellular coverage, deliver broadband access, promote distance\r\nlearning initiatives, etc.).\r\nOverall, this research aims to develop a general and unified framework for spectrally\r\nefficient multitier systems. Specifically, it examines the case of full spectral reuse across\r\ntiers for various centralized and decentralized multitier configurations. In centralized\r\nnetworks, users communicate exclusively to access points, which control admission and\r\nroute information. In non-centralized systems, such responsibilities are distributed over\r\naccess points and users, and ad-hoc connections are possible. The key challenge lies in\r\novercoming cross-tier interference produced by high spectral reuse. This research\r\ndevelops analytical methods that 1) model this interference; and 2) use signal processing,\r\nradio resource allocation, and access control techniques to jointly suppress it and deliver\r\ndesired ubiquity and capacity.\r\nCOVER SHEET FOR PROPOSAL TO THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nFOR NSF USE ONLY\r\nNSF PROPOSAL NUMBER\r\nDATE RECEIVED NUMBER OF COPIES DIVISION ASSIGNED FUND CODE DUNS# (Data Universal Numbering System) FILE LOCATION\r\nFOR CONSIDERATION BY NSF ORGANIZATION UNIT(S) (Indicate the most specific unit known, i.e. program, division, etc.)\r\nPROGRAM ANNOUNCEMENT/SOLICITATION NO./CLOSING DATE/if not in response to a program announcement/solicitation enter NSF 03-041\r\nEMPLOYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (EIN) OR\r\nTAXPAYER IDENTIFICATION NUMBER (TIN)\r\nSHOW PREVIOUS AWARD NO.
