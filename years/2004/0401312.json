 "awd_abstract_narration": "Steel will work on the problem of constructing canonical inner models\r\nfor large cardinal hypotheses, and on related problems in pure descriptive\r\nset theory. One very well known and central problem in this area is\r\nwhether the Proper Forcing Axiom is equiconsistent with the existence of a\r\nsupercompact cardinal. A solution to this problem is probably still far\r\noff, but Steel has recently made some progress using the powerful and\r\nflexible ``core model induction\" method. He intends to pursue and develop\r\nthis method further, as it applies to the Proper Forcing Axiom, and in\r\nseveral other contexts as well. This program leads naturally to a number\r\nof questions concerning the relationship between canonical inner models\r\nwith Woodin cardinals and the derived models of the Axiom of Determinacy\r\nwhich are associated to them. Steel has some results on this connection,\r\nand plans to investigate the area further.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Much of set theory is motivated by the simple question\r\n``What are the proper axioms for mathematics?\".\r\nMathematicians\r\nprove things for a living; what should they take as their\r\ncommon assumptions in these proofs? In the period 1905-1927, Russell,\r\nZermelo, Fraenkel, and Skolem\r\nisolated an elegant list of basic statements about sets, expressed\r\nin the language of set theory, and showed that from these axioms\r\none could derive all of the mathematics of the time. This system of\r\naxioms is now known as Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with Choice,\r\nor ZFC. While there is still no hint of a mathematical statement which\r\ncannot be expressed in the language of set theory, we have\r\ndiscovered that  ZFC is incomplete in important ways. A\r\nsurprising number of quite basic questions about sets in general\r\nare not decided by the axioms of ZFC; moreover, many of the\r\nmore abstract questions of analysis, algebra, and topology are\r\nsimilarly left undecided. This leads to Godel's Program, first formulated\r\nby Kurt Godel in the late 1940's:\r\nDecide\r\nmathematically interesting questions\r\nwhich are independent of ZFC in well-justified extensions of\r\nZFC. There have been great successes in this direction obtained\r\nby adding ``large cardinal hypotheses\" to ZFC.\r\nSuch hypotheses\r\nassert the existence of sets whose  cardinality, or size, is\r\ninaccessible from below in ever stronger senses. Possibly our deepest\r\nunderstanding of large cardinal hypotheses\r\ncomes from the inner model program. This program attempts to\r\nassociate to each large cardinal hypothesis H a canonical minimal\r\nuniverse of sets (or ``inner model\") in which H is true. The stronger\r\nH is, the largere this universe must be.\r\nThe inner models\r\nwe have so far constructed have internal structures which\r\nadmit a systematic, detailed analysis, a  ``fine structure theory\"\r\nwhich  gives us a very good idea as to what these universes\r\nlook like. Inner models are  crucial in several\r\nbasic uses of large cardinal hypotheses to settle questions\r\nleft undecided by ZFC. Steel will focus his efforts on furthering\r\nthe inner model program.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
