 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to provide more accurate and robust simulation of sheet metal forming processes in order to reduce the costs, masses, lead times, and defects of transportation vehicles.  The approach is a cooperative use-directed basic research project between the Ohio State University and General Motors R&D Center, with supporting partners Altair Engineering and The Ohio Supercomputer Center.  Novel and practical finite-element analysis procedures will be developed following basic numerical advances made in the early stages of the project.  In particular, advances in implicit numerical technology will be sought to confer the usual advantages of accuracy and consistency, while improving robustness and efficiency.\r\n\r\nSocietal benefits of the project include improved fuel economy of vehicles, reduced impact on the environment, and safer and more affordable transportation for consumers.  The highly cooperative and leveraged plan includes 12 months of student internships at GM and Altair aimed at broadening the training of graduate-level engineers to include experience in industry.  The supported graduate students will profit from the opportunity, via daily cooperation with partners and internships at partner sites, to work within and learn the cultures of large companies (GM) and smaller software developers (Altair).  Co-PI Wagoner will utilize the numerical advances realized in the project to construct reliable instruction modules for student-generated simulation of sheet forming programs.\r\n",
