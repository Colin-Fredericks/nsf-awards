 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator would hold a working conference to discuss how ideas are transferred.  The primary goal of this conference is to address the theoretical and methodological issues raised by recent critiques of transfer and to develop a research agenda to guide further empirical work. An enduring goal of education has been to provide learning experiences that are useful beyond the specific conditions of initial learning. However, researchers' progress in understanding and supporting the generalization of learning has been limited due to methodological and theoretical problems with the transfer construct.  Numerous critiques of transfer have contributed to a growing acknowledgement that there is little agreement about the nature of transfer and the nature of its underlying mechanisms.  The intent of this conference is to reach sufficient agreement on the theoretical and methodological issues in defining transfer so that research can proceed productively.",
