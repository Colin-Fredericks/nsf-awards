 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation Office of Polar Programs (NSF/OPP) has established the South Pole Station Modernization project as a multi-year project to replace the facility infrastructure of Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station.  A component of this large activity addresses the development of enhanced satellite communications capability utilizing the NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS).  NSF requires the development of a gimbaled antenna ground station that will establish Ku-Band and S-Band single access links with NASA White Sands Complex for any first generation TDRSS satellite that comes into view at South Pole Station.\r\n\r\nNSF has determined that a SBA 8(a) set-aside award will meet the requirements for design, build, and install for the earth station.  NSF has obtained the services of LJT, Inc. of Huntsville, AL (Columbia, MD office) for these services.  The company's engineering subject matter expertise and prior experience systems engineering for NASA TDRSS projects is a key consideration in making the set aside.\r\n\r\nProject kick-off activities have been defined in a narrow scope letter contract intended to refine systems design and system cost estimates.  The scope of the letter contract has limited the performance period to with a not-to-exceed cost of $200,000.  The deliverables at the end of the performance period will better define the scope and system cost for follow-on build and implementation.  Definitization of the final contract will occur during the letter contract performance period.\r\n\r\nAn initial funding increment of $200,000 is recommended for award.\r\n\r\n",
