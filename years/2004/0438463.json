McPherson\r\nTulane University\r\n\r\nSelf-Assembly of a Novel Organogel and Applications to Nanostructured Materials \r\nTechnical Summary \r\n\r\nFundamental and applied Nano-Technology research to develop a new class of self-assembled organogels that spontaneously form when an anionic surfactant (AOT) dissolved in a nonpolar solvent is contacted with the suitable phenol. There has been significant recent research interest in designing small molecule gelators that form polymer-like networks in nonpolar solvents through non-covalent interactions. Such gels have tremendous potential as templates for materials synthesis in applications such as nanostructured membranes, as potential field responsive materials for sensor development, and in environmental applications related to containing organic spills. \r\n\r\nThe PI's earlier work has indicated that the AOT+phenol organogel system appears to be made up of three levels of self-assembly, from strands to fibers and thence to fiber assemblies. The proposed work seeks to understand the transition from inverse micelles of the anionic surfactant, to the gel state, upon doping with the phenolic component. This will be done through a full range of experimental techniques involving FTIR and NMR spectroscopy, neutron, x-ray and light scattering, differential scanning calorimetry, atomic force and electron microscopy, and rheology. \r\n\r\nThe PI's then propose to develop these organogels as templates for materials synthesis. By polymerizing the solvent phase, we will be able to generate nanostructured materials. They will be able to incorporate functional nanoparticles (luminescent and/or magnetic) into the gel strands to prepare new field responsive materials with possible erasable signatures. In all these applications, we will exploit the novel properties of the gel (1) its ability to spontaneously form by direct contact of the anionic surfactant and the phenol, and (2) the ability to very easily destroy the gel template by washing with water, thus breaking the AOT-phenol hydrogen bonding responsible for gelation, once the materials synthesis is done. The research may lead to new and simple methods for thin film membranes containing functional and field responsive materials. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts \r\nThe project will provide excellent interdisciplinary training for both undergraduates and graduate students. The combination of spectroscopy, microscopy and scattering techniques that the students will be exposed to will be an invaluable research experience. Tulane operates a unique Coordinated Instrumentation Facility where centralized instrumentation and expertise allow excellent student training. The project investigators are fully committed to providing educational opportunities, and have a strong record of working towards such objectives with formalized programs such as the Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation in Research (LAMP). The research is the continuation of collaboration at Tulane that has produced several Ph.D. graduates and has provided undergraduate research experience to over 10 students. \r\n\r\nFrom a technical perspective, the proposed research results may have applications to the development of novel nanostructured membranes and sensors. Rather than focus on a specific short-term application, the proposal is written to develop concepts that have implications in long-range technology development. \r\n\r\n",
