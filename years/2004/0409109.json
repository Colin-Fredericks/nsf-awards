 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2004 Gordon Research Conference is being held August 8-13, 2004 at Mount Holyoke College.  The theme of this conference is the role of aqueous fluids in rock deformation, examining both the detailed physics and chemistry of deformation when fluids are present and the consequences of water weakening in a variety of geologic settings. Presentations and poster sessions are examining the processes by which fluids affect crack growth, healing and sealing, frictional sliding, pressure solution, diffusion and dislocation creep, and deformation during metamorphism, sources of fluids and fluid flow in faults and deforming rock masses, thin fluid films and hydration at mineral surfaces, and the character and mobility of water-related defects in crystalline interiors. Participants include specialists in rock mechanics, geochemistry, tectonics, petrology and mineral physics reflecting the mutlidisciplinary nature of the conference theme. The program includes significant time for participation by all conference participants to debate current problems and future research directions. The principal goal of this conference is not so much to assess or present what has already been accomplished, but rather to look towards the future and open up new research directions.  The conference format is designed to involve established leaders, both men and women, in a range of disciplines, in discussion with all participants, and to inspire the postdoctoral scientists and graduate students who will carry the field forward.",
