O'Connell\r\nEngineering Conference International (ECI)\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal for travel support for approximately 30 U.S. academic researchers to attend the \"International Conference on Properties and Phase Equilibria for Product and Process Design\" to be held in Snowbird, Utah, May 16-21, 2004.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe International Conference on Properties and Phase Equilibria for Product and Process Design (ICPPEPPD) is held every three years. For the first 21 years the locations alternated between North America and Europe.  In 2001, the conference was held in Asia for the first time, making this a truly global activity.   The first nine conferences have produced highly desirable interactions between academic and industrial and government workers in this vital area for chemical process and product design and simulation. The meetings have also become the most important gatherings for workers from all over the world.  The Ninth Conference held in 2001 in Kurashiki, Japan attracted 247 technical participants from 27 countries.  There were 28% industrial participants, mainly from the US, Japan and the U.K. Academic and industrial organizations from everywhere in the world are now heavily influencing theory, experiment and application of \"Fluid Properties and Phase Equilibria for Chemical Process and Product Design.\"  The 21st Century is moving toward nontraditional systems, especially for sustainability, population growth and economic development.  This means that periodic international conferences should continue to be held to review progress and uncover the next problems and their possible solutions.  This is especially important as industries worldwide dramatically decrease their research. \r\n \r\nBroader Impact:\r\nEach conference has produced important collections of papers in reviewed archival proceedings \r\nvolumes. The 9th Conference provided over 1000 pages of reviews and new research published as volumes 194-197 of the international journal Fluid Phase Equilibria.  The Tenth Conference is scheduled to have a similar format that has been successful at the previous Conferences, including workshops and new session topics.  Similar participation is expected for the 10th Conference as previously.   \r\n\r\nIn the current era of global technology, international interactions must focus on subjects of \r\nwidespread interest that affect industrial practice for process and product development and quality, as well as economics and competitiveness.  The 10th conference is intended to give the participants (industrial, governmental and academic) a review of the state of the art with presentations focusing on the many recent developments in a logically structured manner, to provide directions for the development of both new theories and important practical problems to be solved, to discuss the current professional climate for the discipline, and to expose young researchers to the themes and people of the area.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, this project will benefit young researchers who traditionally have a harder time obtaining the finances needed to attend this major international conference.\r\n\r\n",
