 "awd_abstract_narration": "During heavy precipitation, significant quantities of water vapor are removed from the atmosphere to the surface, resulting in a hydrostatic pressure reduction due to the decrease of mass in the overlying column.  The representation of this precipitation mass sink is either non-existent or incomplete in current atmospheric models because water vapor mass continuity is not explicitly coupled to the total mass continuity or pressure tendency equations.  For tropical cyclones in which precipitation rates may exceed 200 mm per day, the pressure-equivalent mass removal is not negligible, on the order of 20 hPa.  The pressure decrease due to precipitation would be partially compensated by horizontal mass convergence.  However, this convergent inflow may be critical to moisture transport and vorticity generation, especially in the presence of strong rotation.  The initial hypothesis to be tested is that the pressure reduction due to the removal of atmospheric mass by precipitation is a first-order dynamical process in tropical cyclones.  A second, related hypothesis is that including the mass sink effect explicitly in numerical weather prediction models will improve their ability to accurately predict tropical cyclone genesis, intensity, and track.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the research will be on understanding the physical mechanism of the precipitation mass sink as it relates to tropical cyclone dynamics.  The Principal Investigator will isolate the important mechanisms by undertaking a series of numerical model experiments that selectively include and exclude the mass sink terms in the governing equations.  \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of this project are to:\r\n1.  Develop and test a numerical model that includes both water loading and precipitation mass sink effects in the model continuity, pressure-tendency, and momentum equations. \r\n2.  Conduct a thorough observational data analysis for Hurricane Lili (and/or other cases) including in-situ aircraft data, remotely sensed data (radar and satellite) and dropsondes.  The observational analysis will allow detailed evaluation of numerical model simulations. \r\n3.  Conduct a series of sensitivity experiments on Hurricane Lili or other cases.  The analysis will include mass, moisture, and momentum budgets.  Storm-relative budgets for a cylindrical volume moving with the storm will isolate the relative importance of water loading and the precipitation mass sink to tropical cyclone dynamics.  A centerpiece of the analysis will be a potential vorticity (PV) diagnosis, including budget computations and piecewise inversions.\r\n4.  Formulate a conceptual model for tropical cyclogenesis and intensification that accounts for the role of the mass sink mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe impacts of the research include i) potentially improved numerical forecasts of tropical cyclone formation, intensification, and track.  ii) Improved understanding of the role that precipitation plays in the dynamics of tropical cyclones.",
