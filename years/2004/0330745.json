 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major question about the Earth's interior is why the mantle appears\r\nboth well-mixed and unmixed at the same time.  Geochemical analyses imply\r\nthat the two main types of mantle convective upwellings (which create\r\nmid-ocean ridge basalts MORB and ocean-island basalts OIB, respectively)\r\nhave distinct chemical signatures and thus come from different isolated\r\nlayers in the mantle.  However, seismological studies suggest that\r\ncold downwellings (called subducting slabs) sink across the entire\r\nmantle and would therefore stir the mantle and destroy any layering.\r\nThus there appears to be completely contradictory pieces of evidence\r\nof how the mantle convects.  However, it has been recently suggested\r\nthat melting at 410 km depth in the mantle can act as a filter that\r\nsequesters incompatible elements into the deep (sub-410km) mantle, but\r\nallows whole-mantle circulation of major components, thereby satisfying\r\nboth geochemical and geophysical constraints.  As most of the ambient\r\nupwelling mantle rises out of the high-water-solubility transition\r\nzone into the low-solubility upper mantle above 410km, it becomes\r\nwater-supersaturated and undergoes dehydration melting that filters\r\nout incompatible elements. The filtered solid phase supplies dry,\r\ndepleted materials to the MORB source region.  The filter, however,\r\nis suppressed for hotter, faster mantle plumes which therefore deliver\r\nenriched OIBs.  This \"water-filter\" model raises many new questions:  (1)\r\nWhat is the predicted structure of the putative melt layer at the 410km,\r\nand how can this be tested seismologically?  (2) What is the influence\r\nof the filter mechanism on mantle convection and chemical circulation?\r\n(3) What is the nature of hydrous melt at deep upper-mantle conditions?\r\nAnswering these and a host of other important new questions demands an\r\ninterdisciplinary approach and therefore involves a team comprised of\r\na geodynamicist, an experimental mineral physicist, a seismologist and\r\na geochemist.\r\n\r\nBroader impact:\r\n\r\nThis project involves the education of two graduate students in a highly\r\ninterdisciplinary project entailing geodynamics, mineral physics,\r\nseismology and geochemistry.  The water-filter model also raises new\r\nquestions and fields of research that will drive interaction between\r\ndisciplines and provide focus and hypothesis-testing for the larger\r\nobservational and experimental programs such as EarthScope, OMD (Ocean\r\nMantle Dynamics) and COMPRES.",
