The immediate goal\r\nis to develop a theory of zero-curvature and Lax equations on\r\nvariable algebraic curves, which can be instrumental in\r\nconstruction of new integrable models and in the investigations\r\nof geometry of moduli spaces of holomorphic vector bundles.\r\nParticular attention will be paid to the Hamiltonian theory of\r\nthe discrete isomonodromy equations and the B\\\"acklund\r\ntransformations. Efforts will be devoted to functional equations\r\nfor the Baker-Akhiezer functions and their application to the\r\ngeometry of the Abelian varieties. Particular attention will be\r\npaid to the characterization problem of the Prim varieties.\r\n\r\nClassical algebraic geometry, inseparably connected with the\r\nnames of Abel, Riemann, Weierstrass, Poincare, Clebsch, Jacobi\r\nand other outstanding mathematicians of the XIX-th century has\r\nbeen mainly an analytical theory. In the last century it was\r\nenriched by the methods and ideas of topology, commutative\r\nalgebra and has the authority of one of the most fundamental\r\nmathematical disciplines.  The traditional eclectism (in the best\r\nsense of the word) of algebraic geometry has always been a source\r\nof its numerous applications to other branches of\r\nmathematics. The role of algebraic geometry as ``an applied\r\nscience\" has grown immensely in the last 20-25 years, when its\r\nnew applications to the problems of non-linear equations and\r\nquantum field theory were found. The discovery of solitons in the\r\nseventies of the previous century has changed once and forever\r\nthe role which integrable systems play in the development of\r\nmathematics and physics. The soliton theory is applicable to\r\nequations which possess the property of remarkable\r\nuniversality. They arise in the description of the most diverse\r\nphenomena in plasma physics, the theory of elementary particles,\r\nthe theory of superconductivity and in non-linear optics. This\r\nubiquity of integrable systems together with the beautiful\r\nstructures that underlie them has led to ever-growing interest in\r\nthis area. Geometry and algebraic geometry, functional equations\r\nand special functions, Lie algebras and groups all come together\r\nin the modern theory of integrable systems. This unique\r\ncombination of seemingly unrelated branches of mathematics and\r\nphysics provides an opportunity to create new interdisciplinary\r\neducation models.\r\n",
