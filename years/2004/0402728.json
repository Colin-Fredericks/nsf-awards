 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under this award the PIs will use large corals heads primarily of the species Diploria labyrinthiformis to reconstruct multicentury long records of SST variability in the western subtropical North Atlantic.  This should enable exploration of the ocean's role in climate change on decadal and longer time scales, specifically the North Atlantic Oscillation. The  available   instrumental  record  of  SST  extends  back  little  more  than  a  century.  However,  biases  and sparseness  of  data  render  the  older  part  of  the  SST  record  unreliable  and  the  demonstrated  association between NAO and mid-latitude SST anomalies is based exclusively on data gathered since 1950.  The PIs will extend  the  SST  record  for  the  mid-latitude  North  Atlantic  using  long-lived  brain  corals  collected  on Bermuda,  a  site  well  placed  to  index  the  subtropical  gyre.  Three  independent  paleothermometers  ( 18O, Sr/Ca and skeletal growth) will be applied to the skeletons of two massive colonies to construct a 500 year-long  multiproxy  record  of  SST  variability  at  seasonal  resolution.  In  addition  the PIs  will  sample,  date  and analyze four massive non-living colonies already identified as potentially old enough to extend the 500 year-long  proxy  record  back to 1000 AD.  This multicentury  long  record  will  enable  key,  unresolved  issues  in North  Atlantic  climate  to  be  addressed.  In  particular,  estimates  of  the  sensitivity  of  the  mid-latitude atmosphere to changes in surface boundary conditions requires seasonally-resolved records of SST that span the significant climatic events of the late Holocene. The PIs will examine possible secular changes in SST related to global warming and the connection with the NAO anomaly of the past 30 years. Other key questions relate to  the  sensitivity  of  SST  to  solar  forcing  and  volcanic  eruptions,  and  the  existence  of  decadal  through centennial-scale periodicity in surface ocean conditions.",
