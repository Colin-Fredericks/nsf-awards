The objective of their research is to study, under experimental conditions, the electrophysiological effects of endogenously released dopamine on striatal neurons and try to identify those neurons that are dopamine sensitive.  The investigators will utilize electrophysiological recordings on identified striatal neurons and investigate in vivo the effects of endogenously released dopamine.  The experimental conditions will attempt to mimic the physiological conditions.  \r\n\r\nThe project will advance understanding of the natural processes involved in dopamine release, its impact on processes involved in physiological behavior. The U.S. and French investigators will share their complementary expertise in electrophysiological techniques (O'Donnell's group), electrochemical monitoring of dopamine release (Gonon's group) and anatomofunctional techniques (Gonon's group).\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS).  NSF will cover the costs of visits to France by the U.S. investigator and his team.  The CNRS provides support to the French team for visits to the United States.\r\n\r\n",
