 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project concerns the classification of geometric structures on\r\nmanifolds, the geometry of their moduli spaces, and dynamical systems\r\non moduli spaces arising from automorphisms of surfaces.  For example,\r\ncomplete affine 3-manifolds behave similarly to hyperbolic Riemann\r\nsurfaces.  For a large class of examples, the deformation space has\r\nrecently been shown to be a bundle of convex cones over the\r\ndeformation space of hyperbolic surfaces. One aspect of the project is\r\nthe classification and dynamical study of such manifolds, and their\r\nconformal and constant curvature generalizations.  Another aspect of\r\nthis project deals with dynamical systems arising from the\r\nclassification of geometric structures on surfaces.  The action of the\r\nmapping class group on the character variety is a dynamical system\r\nassociated to the fundamental group of the surface and the geometry\r\nassociated to a Lie group.  These moduli spaces support invariant\r\nsymplectic structures, as well as finer structures depending on a\r\nRiemann surface with the given fundamental group.  How do these\r\nstructures change as the Riemann surface varies?  How do the geometry\r\nof these structures influence the dynamics of their topological\r\nsymmetries of the surface? How does dynamical complexity of the\r\nmapping class group action accompany topological complexity of the\r\nmoduli space?\r\n\r\nThese questions lie at the interface between geometry and topology,\r\nunified through the notion of symmetry.  While geometry involves\r\nmetric quantitative relationships, topology concerns the loose\r\nqualitative organization of ``points'' in abstract ``spaces.''\r\nGeometry relates to topology through their respective symmetries,\r\nwhich can be studied algebraically through the techniques of group\r\ntheory. These questions are natural for experimental investigation.\r\nThe Experimental Geometry Lab at the University of Maryland provides\r\ninterested students opportunities for mathematical experimentation in\r\na stimulating environment.  Its goal is the dissemination and\r\npromotion of mathematics, related to the projects described above.\r\nThe Lab will continue to be a center for Undergraduate Research\r\nExperiences, outreach presentations, and interactive projects at all levels.\r\n",
