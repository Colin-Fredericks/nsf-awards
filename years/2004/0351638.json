 "awd_abstract_narration": "The is a U.S.-Polish cooperative research project that will investigate damage and fracture phenomena under dynamic and cyclic loading conditions in modern engineering materials.  The principal investigators are Dr. George Voyiadjis from Louisiana State University & Agricultural and Mechanical College, Dr. Piotr Perzyna and Dr. Wojciech Dornowski from the Institute of Fundamental Technological Research (Warsaw, Poland) and Dr. Tomasz Lodygowski from Poznan University of Technology (Poznan, Poland). \r\n\r\nThis research addresses an important and unresolved problem in the theory of inelastic behavior of materials.  It will enhance the understanding of fracture and particularly localized fracture phenomena in thermo-elasto-viscoplastic flow processes under dynamic loadings in modern engineering materials.  This study is the combination of theoretical modeling, computational simulation and comparisons with existing experimental data to address localization in damage phenomena.  Results of this research are expected to increase the understanding of the localization damage phenomenon and eventually contribute to reducing and controlling detrimental effects of dynamic and impact loads.\r\n\r\nThis project in engineering research fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
