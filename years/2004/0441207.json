 "awd_abstract_narration": "AGEP Post-doctoral Engineering Education Researchers (AGEP PEERs) \r\nUnder the terms of Master Agreement No. 0239565 for unsolicited proposals, the National\r\nAcademy of Sciences requests funds to support four (4) Alliances for Graduate Education\r\nand the Professoriate (AGEP) alumni per year over a three-year period as post-doctoral\r\nfellows in further preparation for their practice of engineering education research as faculty\r\nmembers at the Nation.s leading universities. These AGEP alumni will be referred to as\r\nAGEP Post-doctoral Engineering Education Researchers (AGEP PEERs) and will contribute \r\nto the production of faculty peers of unquestioned excellence in the multiple forms of \r\nscholarship required for faculty for the 21st Century. The work will be performed by the\r\nCenter for the Advancement of Scholarship on Engineering Education of the National\r\nAcademy of Engineering. The outcomes of this effort will be\r\n1. Identification and placement of 12 AGEP alumni at engineering education research\r\ncenters for 12-month post-doctoral research experiences focused on engineering\r\neducation with expectation of resulting publication.\r\n2. Attendance of an annual Fellows meeting by current and former AGEP PEERs to build\r\ncommunity and leverage individual experiences.\r\n3. Attendance of up to 3 additional professional meetings by each AGEP PEER to establish\r\na presence in their professional community.\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThis effort seeks to strengthen the human infrastructure and diversity of the professoriate by\r\nlinking AGEP alumni with premier centers of engineering education research. This effort\r\ncomplements the disciplinary expertise AGEP fellows have developed within their doctoral\r\nprogram by building their skills in the scholarship of teaching and learning. Thus, this project\r\nadvances the integration of research and education.\r\nBroader Impacts \r\nSuccessful completion of this project will contribute to the establishment of a cadre of new\r\nminority faculty well prepared for excellence in both research and education. Their skills will\r\nserve to inspire their peers as well as new generations of scholars from all groups and\r\npopulations. Additionally, greater awareness of the rigor and applicability of education research\r\nby engineering faculty will contribute to more inclusive definitions of faculty scholarship and a\r\nbeneficial modification of engineering faculty tenure and promotion systems.",
