 "awd_abstract_narration": "Foreman will investigate the descriptive set theoretic\r\naspects of the classification problem for ergodic measure preserving\r\nsystems. He has partial results showing, for example, that they cannot be\r\nclassified by countable structures. He conjectures that the isomorphism\r\nproblem is provably complex, e.g. analytic but not Borel. The second\r\naspect of Foreman's proposal is to study ``canonical structure\" in set\r\ntheory. This is structure that requires the Axiom of Choice for its\r\nexistence, but is independent of the choices made in it construction. Of\r\nparticular interest are PCF objects and relations with squares and\r\ndiamonds.\r\n\r\nForeman will investigate two areas of mathematics. The first has to do\r\nwith the evolution of complex systems in time. These systems appear to\r\nshow random behaviour, but of qualitatively different sorts. Foreman's\r\nproject is to show that various behavior types are not distinguishable by\r\nconcrete observations. The second project has to do with the assumptions\r\nthat the  study of mathematics is based on. The usual assumptions are not\r\nstrong enough to be able to find the answers to all mathematical\r\nquestions. For this reason it is necessary to investigate strengthenings\r\nof the ordinary assumptions. Foreman proposes to do this by focussing on\r\n``canonical structure\" in set theory.",
