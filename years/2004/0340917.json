 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) This project is developing a new quantum mechanics curriculum for junior/senior level undergraduates.  The curriculum explains modern formulations and interpretations of quantum mechanics to undergraduates, and focuses on fundamental concepts, in particular on quantum states and measurements.   The curriculum is novel in that it unifies laboratory and classroom activities.  Instead of simply talking about gedanken experiments in a lecture, students actually perform the experiments.    This makes quantum mechanics more real and less abstract.  The laboratory experiments have been chosen for their relevance in the 21st century; they involve studying the properties of single photons, including experiments that demonstrate existence of light quanta, single-photon interference, two-photon interference, and tests of Bell's inequalities.  The newly designed laboratory experiments and lecture materials are being made available on the web and presented at AAPT meetings.",
