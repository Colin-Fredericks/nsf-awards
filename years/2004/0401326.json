 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past few decades, the topic of partially hyperbolic dynamical\r\nsystems has emerged as one main direction in which the theory of\r\ncomplicated (\"chaotic\") dynamical systems has extended beyond the\r\nclassical setting of hyperbolic dynamics. This research has been driven in\r\npart by the realization that many practical applications of dynamical\r\nsystems to experimental phenomena require a much broader theory.\r\n\r\nThe PI's research over the last decade has focused on the fundamental\r\nergodic -- that is, statistical -- properties that partially hyperbolic\r\nsystems generically can be expected to display.  The PI's work with her\r\ncollaborators has led recently to a proof of a \"Boltzmann Ergodic\r\nHypothesis\"  for partially hyperbolic systems in low dimension: the\r\ngeneric conservative partially hyperbolic system is ergodic.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research has two aspects:\r\n\r\n* Extending the previous work of the PI and her collaborators on the\r\nergodicity of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms.\r\n\r\n* A study of rigidity of solvable groups actions on manifolds, in\r\nparticular those actions that contain partially hyperbolic elements.\r\n\r\nThe material resulting from this research proposal will be widely\r\ndisseminated, through talks at conferences, online preprint servers, and\r\npublication in scholarly journals.  A significant component of this grant\r\nis devoted to graduate-student training on the Ph.D. level.\r\n",
