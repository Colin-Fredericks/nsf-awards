 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal addresses the fundamental challenge of creating a theory \r\nthat gives rise to directionally unbiased, fast processing of images \r\nand multidimensional data structures. The proposed Isotropic Multiresolution \r\nAnalysis (IMRA) enables decompositions of data structures without \r\norientational preference that parallel the numerical efficiency of one \r\ndimensional MRA-wavelet constructions. A crucial ingredient of this new theory \r\nis an MRA of radial functions based on an innovative concept of radial \r\ntranslations. Together with a suitable angular resolution, this allows to \r\nreplicate all the beneficial characteristics of classical one-dimensional \r\nMRA-wavelets in higher dimensions. Therefore, IMRA-wavelets are expected to \r\nparallel the success of their one-dimensional predecessors in isolating edges \r\nand separating textures. Compared to previous attempts of MRA-construtions \r\nin higher dimensions, IMRAs combine symmetry properties, smoothness, and \r\ncompactness of support of scaling functions and wavelets to an unprecedented \r\ndegree. The proposed theory is anticipated to have a significant impact on all \r\nareas of digital signal processing in two or more dimensions, especially in \r\nbiomedical image processing. \r\n\r\nTo date, digital image processing systems commonly handle data in a row \r\nand column fashion. Although this pixelized approach is natural for digital \r\nmachines, it is much less natural if the objective is to extract information \r\nfrom natural images or more general multidimensional data structures. In this \r\nproposal, we create a mathematical theory that mimicks features of retinal \r\nprocessing by mammalian visual systems. Retinal processing is known to detect \r\nedges and textures at different scales of spatial and temporal resolution, \r\nregardless of their orientation and of the topology of their boundary contours. \r\nThe proposed theory of Isotropic Multiresolution Analysis (IMRA) offers a way \r\nof digitizing analog signals and of synthesizing analog signals from digital \r\ndata in a manner that is more compatible with the \"digitization\" of natural \r\nimages performed by our retina. One particular component of IMRAs is the use of \r\nradial translations, inspired by the evolving wave pattern created when a rock \r\nfalls in a pond of calm water. To ensure fast numerical processing \r\ncapabilities, we use concepts similar to those in the framework of wavelets, \r\nwhich have proved computationally efficient in the processing of one- \r\ndimensional signals, e.g. audio. The intellectual merit of this work is that it \r\ndelivers directionally unbiased, fast processing capabilities to all areas of \r\ndigital signal processing of two or more dimensions, in particular to \r\nbiomedical image processing. The Fast Isotropic Wavelet Algorithms resulting \r\nfrom our theory will be applied to anonymized medical patient data provided to \r\nus by the world renowned Texas Heart Institute (THI) in a joint effort for the \r\naccurate and early detection of the formation of vulnerable plaque in coronary \r\narteries. The goal of this effort is an accurate non-invasive initial screening \r\ntest to assess the risk of mycardial infarcts using CT-scans of the heart. \r\n\r\n",
