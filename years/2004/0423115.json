 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Project La Costa\" is a three-year, youth-based ITEST project proposed by the Southwest Texas State University.  The project seeks to create a computer science academy to provide IT experiences for 250 Hispanic youth, including girls, from five Central and South Texas school districts.  Students will start on the project beginning with 8th grade and continue until they are in 10th grade.  In 8th grade students will focus on computer hardware, operating systems and desktop management.  In 9th grade students will focus on computer programming, robotics and web page and web site development.  In 10th grade students will focus on computer systems and network management.  The project will provide each student with 120 contact hours per year.  The project is named \"La Costa,\" which implies \"a vocational vista for students\".  \"Project La Costa\" has five inter-related goals:  educational, programmatic, curriculum, institutional and workforce.  The project, which will be conducted in a bilingual and bicultural community, will have after-school, weekend and summer activities integrating computer skills, family involvement, role modeling, tutoring, mentoring, career development and externships.",
