 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator develops mesh-free particle methods for\r\nnonlinear partial differential equations, with particular\r\nreference to problems  that admit nonsmooth (discontinuous)\r\nsolutions and to problems that involve highly disparate scales. \r\nA major focus is developing procedures to recover an approximate\r\nsolution from the particle distribution that adapt to varying\r\nsmoothness of the solution.  Other aims are to develop hybrid\r\nfinite-volume-particle methods and improve the accuracy and\r\nefficiency of particle methods.  The methods are applied to\r\nseveral illustrative problems: zero diffusion-dispersion limits\r\nfor conservation laws, the Euler-Poincare equations, models of\r\nmultiphase and multifluid flows, pollutant transport problems\r\nwith discontinuous coefficients, simulation of chemotactic\r\nbacteria aggregation, snd stochastic initial value problems.\r\n\r\n     Solving partial differential equations numerically is an\r\nimportant and efficient tool for the quantitative and qualitative\r\nstudy of many phenomena in different applied areas that otherwise\r\ncould not have been studied at all.  The investigator develops\r\nnumerical methods that offer some advantages over other\r\ntechniques for computing solutions of partial differential\r\nequations, particularly for problems with complicated geometries\r\nor moving boundaries, and applies the methods to a number of\r\nillustrative examples.\r\n",
