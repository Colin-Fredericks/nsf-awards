 "awd_abstract_narration": "As population growth and urban development continue to expand in the coastal margin, flooding poses a\r\nmajor threat to human safety and the integrity of the natural environment. To mitigate the adverse\r\nimpacts of coastal flooding, decision makers are increasingly advocating watershed or ecosystem\r\napproaches to management. While it is argued that some of the most serious flood hazards are the result\r\nof a failure to understand the regional ecological context, little empirical research has been done on how\r\ngrowth and development patterns increase the threat of floods at the watershed level and how\r\ncommunities respond over time to repetitive flooding events.\r\n\r\nMy career plan will address this need by implementing an interactive research and educational program\r\non flood mitigation, sustainable watershed management, and policy learning. It will develop a framework\r\nfor adaptive decision making for coastal flood hazards by integrating research, education, and information\r\ndissemination. The research component will focus on the impacts of wetland development on coastal\r\nwatershed flooding and policy learning at the community level to mitigate the adverse impacts of flood\r\ndamage to the human and natural environment. A two-phase longitudinal research design will employ\r\nboth quantitative and qualitative analyses to investigate flooding problems in Texas and Florida. Phase\r\none will use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to examine the spatial pattern of wetland\r\ndevelopment over a ten-year period and correlate this development with coastal watershed flooding.\r\nPhase two will identify thresholds of policy learning by examining how communities adjust and adapt to\r\nrepetitive flooding. Both research phases will use multivariate analysis to measure the effects of wetland\r\ndevelopment on flooding and the effects of flooding on policy adjustment while controlling for\r\nsocioeconomic, biophysical, and other contextual factors. The education component of the career plan\r\nwill develop place-based learning modules on coastal watershed management and flood mitigation. A\r\nseries of interdisciplinary, problem-based seminars will provide an authentic learning experience to\r\nprepare future scientists, teachers, and policy makers to address ecosystem-level hazards issues.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of Proposed Plan \r\nThe intellectual merit of the research is based on advancing knowledge of the causes of coastal watershed\r\nflooding and showing how to adapt policy mechanisms to mitigate floods. Results will contribute to a\r\ndecision-making framework for flood mitigation by increasing understanding of the specific type, size,\r\nand location of wetlands that mitigate flooding and provide guidance to watershed planners for managing\r\nadaptively over time. This understanding is critical given the continued development of coastal areas and\r\nthe increasing vulnerability of human populations to coastal flooding. One of the unique features of the\r\nproposed research will be the utilization of data sources that have been underutilized in the analysis of\r\nwetland loss. The national wetland permit and USGS flood gauge databases offer important opportunities\r\nto conduct an empirical study on watershed flooding.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of Proposed Plan \r\nWhile the project will contribute to scientific understanding and management capabilities, it will also\r\npromote teaching and learning on system-wide ecological problems. By building on participation in the\r\nUniversity.s NSF sponsored Informational Technology and Science Program and Sustainable Coastal\r\nMargins Program, the project will integrate research on watershed management and flood mitigation with\r\neducation and training to solve these issues. Interdisciplinary, place-based learning modules will train\r\nstudents and teachers to understand and act upon complex ecosystem management problems through\r\nproblem solving, field experience, and the development of watershed case studies and associated\r\nwebsites. Courses during the academic year will target graduate students, while summer sessions will\r\nalso include K-12 teachers. Another positive impact of the project will be recruitment and training of\r\nstudents from underrepresented groups. These individuals will play a vital role in both the research and\r\neducational components of the project. Finally, the dissemination of results will benefit the academic and\r\npolicy making community. In addition to presenting research results at conferences and workshops, the\r\ninformation will be shared with public decision makers.",
