 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for up to two-years for an REU Site at New Mexico State University. Five students will be recruited for an eight-week summer experience in research related to information-based manufacturing. The overall goal of this program is to attract and encourage students with physical challenges to consider a research-related career as a viable career option. Students will have an opportunity to engage in state-of-the-art research projects in areas such as virtual prototyping and information-oriented modeling. It is anticipated that this research experience will effectively expose students to the exciting world of research and thus encourage students to pursue graduate study. It is anticipated that this program will have a Broader Impact on the nations need to increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents engaged in research-related careers at U.S. universities, government agencies, and in private-sector organizations.",
