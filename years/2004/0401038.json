 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will focus on  \r\nmodels involving multidimensional systems  \r\nof nonlinear partial differential equations,  \r\narising in elastodynamics, incompressible  \r\nfluid flow, and electromagnetics.  \r\nThe emphasis of this work will be on existence and long time  \r\nbehavior of solutions using analytical methods which  \r\nexploit the fundamental structure of the models, based on the null condition.  \r\nIn the area of nonlinear elastodynamics, the  \r\nconnection between the structure of the strain-energy  \r\nrelations and global well-posedness for the  \r\ninitial value problem will be studied.  \r\nThe research aims at a better understanding of  \r\nthe relationship between  \r\ncompressible and incompressible materials,  \r\nthe formation of shock waves, and the  behavior  \r\nof elastic bodies in astrophysical applications.  \r\nThe recent methods developed for elastodynamics  \r\nwill be applied to the Born-Infeld system from nonlinear  \r\nelectromagnetics and recently revived in string theory.  \r\nThe confinement of vortical motion in planar incompressible ideal fluids  \r\nwill be studied.   \r\n\r\n   According to the classical principle of determinism, the \r\nthe evolutionary laws of a physical system together with an initial \r\nconfiguration should determine the state of the system at all future times. \r\nMathematically speaking, the the laws of physics are encoded in \r\na system of partial differential equations solutions of which \r\nshould exist and depend uniquely and continuously on the initial \r\nconfiguration.  Creating the mathematical framework for a given \r\nsystem and verifying its well-posedness (in the sense above) \r\nis thus a problem of fundamental importance. \r\nMuch of the research in this proposal is devoted to such \r\nbasic questions for models describing the dynamics of elastic \r\nmaterials.   Material properties are expressed \r\nthrough the specification of the relation between strain and energy, \r\nusing phenomenological arguments.    However, phenomenology \r\nalone does not fully characterize the structure of the model. \r\nThe desire to describe dynamics for all future times \r\nleads to the imposition of further structural assumptions \r\nwhich are deeply connected with the mathematical analysis of \r\nthe problem.  In this sense, mathematical analysis offers \r\nimportant guidance in the selection of the model. \r\nWith a mathematically tractable theory in hand, \r\nit is possible to consider qualitative questions, such as how \r\nthe behavior of the system varies under changes in \r\nmaterial properties.  In particular, the stability \r\nof the system as the material becomes incompressible \r\nwill be studied.  This includes rubber-like materials, \r\nfor example.  The techniques will also be adapted to \r\nallow for the inclusion of relativistic effects, \r\nnecessary for astrophysical applications. \r\nThe Born-Infeld model from nonlinear electrodynamics \r\n(and recently revived in the theory of strings) will \r\nalso be investigated, since it shares similar structural \r\nproperties. \r\n \r\n",
