Light plays an important role in providing outside signals perceived by the plant.  Photoperiod is an example of one such external signal that controls processes like flowering and potato tuber formation. During tuber formation, a signal is initiated in the leaves and moves through the plant to activate tuber formation. The nature of this signal is unknown but mobile ribonucleic acids (RNAs) may be involved. The goal of this application is to investigate the developmental role of the long-distance movement of specific messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in relation to day-length. Preliminary evidence implicates two mRNAs that encode transcription factors (proteins that bind to genes to regulate their activity) in this process. These proteins control vegetative growth by affecting plant hormone levels. The objectives of this proposal are to identify signaling molecules that control tuberization in potato and to understand the mechanism of their transport. It is proposed that the long-distance movement of specific RNAs acts as a signal that controls growth in potato. This hypothesis will be tested with transport experiments and by studying the mechanism of RNA movement. This proposed project will provide valuable new information on a novel mobile signaling mechanism for coordinating growth in whole plants. This project will integrate research and education through the training of students participating in programs in the life sciences at Iowa State University.  Specific programs will be targeted to include both women and members of under-represented groups in the proposed research.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
