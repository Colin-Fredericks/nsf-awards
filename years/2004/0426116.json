Preliminary studies using DNA probes revealed an astonishing diversity of previously unknown fungi in alpine soils of Colorado. Especially surprising was the discovery of several large and never-before described groups of fungi. In this project by Colorado and Maine investigators Steven Schmidt, Andrew Martin, and Joyce Longcore, soil fungi from diverse alpine sites in Peru, New Zealand and Western North America will be studied. The investigators will use new DNA-based methods to study the distribution of these organisms in nature. Simultaneously with this effort they will implement a large-scale effort to bring many of these previously unknown organisms into laboratory culture. Having these organisms in culture will allow the researchers to describe previously unknown fungal species, link their findings to traditional taxonomy, and screen these organisms for potential biotechnological applications. Isolated organisms, photographs, genomic DNA, and ribosomal DNA sequences will be archived in a public museum (American Museum of Natural History) and in appropriate databases. In addition, an interactive Web-based museum will be established at University of Colorado, providing access to all the data and links to descriptions of the research sites. \r\nThere is a sense of urgency about studying the biodiversity of alpine environments because they are among the world's most threatened ecosystems due to environmental change, including global warming. In fact, alpine snowfields and glaciers are presently melting at unprecedented rates. The research will involve scientists and technicians in three countries. Training will be provided for a graduate student at the University of Maine and a minority graduate student and a postdoctoral scientist at the University of Colorado (CU). In addition, the proposed research will dovetail with existing Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs at CU and with an ongoing K-12 education program by providing opportunities for students and teachers to become involved in the research. \r\n\r\n",
