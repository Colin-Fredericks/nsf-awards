 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the last decade, quantum computing and quantum information processing (QIP) have attracted significant interest due to the promise of more efficient algorithms for solving classically hard problems such as data searching and factorization.  The latter is particularly relevant from the standpoint of national security as many data encryption schemes remain secure based on the difficulty of factoring large integer keys.  Currently, we do not know how to build a quantum computer that is large enough that the promises of increased computational power can be realized.  Of the many physical systems under development for potential use as quantum processors, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is the furthest advanced.  NMR exploits atomic nuclei that exist in spin states of \"up\" and \"down\".  These spin states can be manipulated using pulsed magnetic fields to produce quantum logic gates and implement quantum algorithms.  To date, several types of manipulations and algorithms have been demonstrated for spin bearing molecules in solution using liquid-state NMR.  There are significant benefits, however, to performing QIP in static single crystal solids.  In particular, the speed of a quantum algorithm can be increased by 2-3 orders of magnitude by taking advantage of interactions between nuclear spins that are inherently larger in solids.  As well, single crystal solids are compatible with low temperatures, which can substantially increase sensitivity and address fundamental questions of state initialization and scalability.  Indeed, because of increased speed, potentially larger processors, and better sensitivity, solid-state NMR has been tapped for next-generation QIP.  Recently our group was the first to report experiments on a three-qubit NMR quantum information processor, using a static single-crystal of isotopically labeled glycine (H215N13CH213COOH) (Journal of Chemical Physics 119(3), 1643-1649 (2003)).  Under this research program, we propose to develop new materials and methods for next-generation single crystal solid-state NMR QIP, seeking to extend the size and power of quantum processors and mapping out important physical parameters that define this technology.  In the process, a number of graduate, postdoctoral, and undergraduate students will be trained in state-of-the techniques of both chemistry and physics, enabling a strong technological base to support the future needs of both industrial and government research laboratories.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
