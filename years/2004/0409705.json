 "awd_abstract_narration": "Summary. The Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) requests 2.6 years of funding to support\r\nthree tasks that will translate SCEC's basic-research accomplishments into products for direct use in\r\nearthquake risk reduction. All of the tasks involve collaborations with earthquake engineers and other\r\nend-user communities coordinated through SCEC's new Implementation Interface. A SCEC Product\r\nReview Panel, comprising representatives from the USGS, CGS, and end-user organizations, will be set\r\nup to ensure that SCEC activities are coordinated with the USGS and CGS hazard programs and that\r\nproducts are appropriately described, documented, and disseminated.\r\nTask 1: Produce ground-motion time histories for use in performance-based earthquake engineering\r\n(PBEE). Ground-motion time histories are necessary input into testing facilities and computer-based\r\ndynamic analysis of structures that engineers will use to develop PBEE. Simulated broadband time\r\nhistories are needed to augment the limited set of recorded time histories close to large earthquakes.\r\nUnder this task, we will use tested codes to produce a extensive database of simulated time histories\r\nparameterized by magnitude, distance, and soil conditions. The database will facilitate geoscience\r\napplications by the NEES Consortium and the three NSF Earthquake Engineering Research Centers, and\r\nit will augment the Design Ground Motion Library Project, sponsored by the California Strong Motion\r\nInstrumentation Project and by the PEER-Lifelines (PEER-LL) Program.\r\nTask 2: Participate in Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) Project. The Next Generation Attenuation\r\n(NGA) Project, co-sponsored by SCEC, PEER-Lifelines and the USGS, will develop a new suite of\r\nground-motion attenuation models for shallow crustal earthquakes. SCEC is already committed to the\r\ncurrent phase, NGA-E (Empirical), which aims to update attenuation relationships derived from recorded\r\nstrong motion data. This proposal requests support for SCEC's role in the next two phases, NGA-H\r\n(Hybrid), which will incorporate both simulated and recorded ground motions, and NGA-F, which will\r\ndevelop a tectonic-displacement model. NGA products will fulfill a clearly stated need of Caltrans, the\r\nCalifornia Energy Commission, and PG&E, and of earthquake engineering practice at large.\r\nTask 3: Produce Ground-Motion and Structural Simulations for Scenario Earthquakes in Los Angeles.\r\nRecent SCEC research has quantified major potential earthquakes on the Puente Hills blind thrust system.\r\nTask 3 will utilize this information to construct realistic scenarios for broadband ground motions from the\r\nPHT and other hazardous sources in the LA region, and it will engage earthquake engineers in assessing\r\nthe implications. A pilot study employing J. Hall's nonlinear structural simulation code will be\r\nundertaken to quantify the effects of a Puente Hills earthquake on buildings in downtown Los Angeles\r\nand use the results to evaluate current code provisions.\r\nIntellectual Merit. Reducing earthquake risk is a prime example of a system-level problem requiring\r\nbroad interdisciplinary collaboration and attention to emergent phenomena. The proposed program will\r\naddress the issues of earthquake risk reduction from this system-level perspective, and it will advance the\r\nfundamental understanding of the relationship between earthquake source physics and resulting ground\r\nmotions -- a major goal of the SCEC research program.\r\nBroader Impacts. The proposed program will apply SCEC basic research to guide the development of\r\nthe new ground-motion prediction models and ground-motion time histories used by researchers and\r\npractitioners of earthquake engineering and risk assessment. Through the close coordination with NSFsponsored\r\nearthquake engineering activities (see attached letters), this project can be expected to have a\r\nnationwide impact on how basic geoscience is utilized to reduce seismic risk.",
