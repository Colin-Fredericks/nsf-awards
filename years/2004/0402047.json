 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe project has two major parts. First, we take a rather\r\nnon-obvious definition of \"monodromy\" for difference equations due\r\nto Birkhoff and aim to develop a general theory of transformations\r\nof difference equations which preserve the monodromy. The\r\nresulting structure bears some similarity to the classical theory\r\nof isomonodromy deformations of differential equations and\r\ndegenerates to it in a certain limit. Second, we apply the\r\nisomonodromy transformations of difference equations to evaluation\r\nof the so-called gap probabilities in discrete probabilistic\r\nmodels of random-matrix type which arise in many different domains\r\nincluding combinatorics, representation theory, percolation\r\ntheory, tiling models, etc.\r\n\r\nThe theory of isomonodromy deformations of ordinary differential\r\nequations with rational coefficients is a classical subject\r\ndeveloped in the end of the XIXth -- beginning of the XXth century\r\nby Riemann, Schlesinger, Fuchs, and Garnier. Since then the\r\nisomonodromy deformations have found numerous applications in very\r\ndifferent domains of mathematics and mathematical physics, from\r\nalgebraic and differential geometry to random matrices and\r\nrepresentation theory. On the other hand, in recent years there\r\nhas been considerable interest in analyzing a certain class of\r\ndiscrete probabilistic models which in appropriate limits converge\r\nto well-known models of random matrix theory. The sources of these\r\nmodels are quite diverse, they include combinatorics,\r\nrepresentation theory, percolation theory, random growth\r\nprocesses, tiling models and others. The goal of the research\r\npresented in this proposal is to develop a general theory of\r\n\"isomonodromy transformations\" for linear systems of DIFFERENCE\r\nequations with rational coefficients. In these probabilistic\r\nmodels mentioned above, we often see how two problems which seem\r\nto be unrelated to each other, and which even come from parts of\r\nmathematics that do not seem to have any overlap, lead to the same\r\nfinal result. We believe that the project will provide a visible\r\ncommon ground for many of such coincidences and thus will promote\r\nand accelerate the exchange of methods and ideas accumulated by\r\ndifferent groups of researchers.\r\n\r\n",
