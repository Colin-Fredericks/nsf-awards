 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on the biology of Septobasidium, a fungal parasite\r\non scale insects. Scale insects are common agricultural and horticultural\r\npests, and Septobasidium is a fungus that sterilizes the insects that it\r\ninfects. However, colonies of Septobasidium require both infected and\r\nuninfected insects to survive. Because Septobasidium lives in this complex\r\nassociation with its host scale insects its diversification is expected to\r\nbe tightly linked to diversity and diversification in host scale insects.\r\nThis research seeks to elucidate any correlative patterns of\r\ndiversification in the hosts and parasites and to determine the processes\r\nthat lead to the formation of those patterns. The proposed research has\r\ntwo main parts. The first part uses DNA sequence data from both fungi and\r\nhost insects to examine large-scale patterns of host association and\r\ncospeciation that structure diversity within the symbiosis. Phylogenetic\r\nmethods are used to infer the history of hosts and parasites, and these\r\nreconstructed histories are compared to determine how host evolution is\r\nrelated to parasite evolution. The second part implements methods to\r\nanalyze DNA sequence data from multiple populations of Septobasidium\r\nspecies from across the southeastern United States in order to identify\r\nprocesses that generate the large-scale patterns. Population processes\r\nsuch as migration and dispersal are estimated from DNA sequence variation\r\nseparately and simultaneously for both hosts and parasites. Comparing\r\nthese processes from several different fungal species with different host\r\ninsects and ecologies but from overlapping geographic ranges will\r\ndetermine how strongly the host and parasite population processes\r\ninfluence each other. Combining the two major parts provides insight into\r\nevolutionary diversification in this symbiosis and represents the first\r\nstudy to apply critical genetic approaches to understand the ecology and\r\nevolution of this classic fungus/ insect relationship.\r\nThis study benefits the public in several specific ways. This study\r\nimproves cross discipline communication through collaboration of a\r\nmycology student and an expert entomologist. The study also provides\r\nopportunities for undergraduate students to gain research experience.\r\nFinally, the research furthers understanding of fungal/ scale insect\r\nparasitism that may lead to biological control of plant pests.\r\n\r\n",
