 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nDr. Hunt is awarded an MPS Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship to conduct a research program abroad at the University of Wales, Cardiff, the United Kingdom. Dr. Hunt's research aims to revolutionize sub-millimeter astronomy with the development of large-format detector arrays that utilize superconducting technology, better known as transition-edge superconducting (TES) bolometers. Dr. Hunt plans to develop a line of research that will simplify and isolate the components of a TES in an attempt to address the excess noise issues that are seemingly ubiquitous in these devices. Dr. Hunt will also take advantage of the detector-testing and fabrication facilities at Cardiff, and collaborate with groups at NIST in the U.S. and SRON in The Netherlands to study different TES materials. \r\n\r\nIn addition, Dr. Hunt plans to participate in specific educational activities that contribute to the broader impacts of her research program. Dr. Hunt will develop a public lecture about radiation detectors, give talks to young students, work with graduate and undergraduate students, and encourage women in science.\r\n\r\n",
