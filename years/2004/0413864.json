 "awd_abstract_narration": "Problems in diverse scientific disciplines ranging from materials science to macromolecular dynamics,   to atmosphere/ocean science and climate modeling involve the nonlinear interaction of  physical processes across many length and time scales ranging from the microscopic to the macroscopic. From a  modeling and  computational perspective, microscopic simulation methods such as Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte \r\nCarlo (MC) algorithms   can describe complex, out of equilibrium interactions at  small scales (e.g.  between atoms or molecules). Although there is  substantial progress in improving aspects of these computational methods, they are still limited to short length and time scales, while on the other hand device sizes and morphological features observed in experiments often involve much larger scales; at the same time stochastic \r\nfluctuations--inherited from the microscopics--can be important, for instance  in  self-organization  problems characterized by small coherent structures such as pattern formation in nanotechnology applications. In addition to such challenges posed by the disparity in scales  within the same model, in many instances we are faced with an additional disparity in models: for example  in phenomena with detailed fluid/surface or boundary layer interactions it is necessary to couple microscopic, possibly stochastic models describing the  dynamics of atoms or molecules on a surface, along with continuum PDE for  species, fluid and thermodynamic variables on the overlying to the surface gas phase. It is therefore inevitable that  features of the microscopic model will  essentially enter as a subgrid effect in the coupling with the coarse computational grid of the macroscopic PDE models. In this case,  the proper incorporation and simulation of stochastic effects from the subgrid microscale is a critical element in the modeling and simulations. The proposed projects focus on aspects of the aforementioned   issues by putting forward a combination of interconnected modeling, computational and analysis questions,  roughly divided in two categories: (i) Mathematical strategies for the coarse-graining of microscopic  models and the corresponding\r\n simulators, addressing problems which are currently  intractable with conventional MD/MC  due to scale limitations. Here, it is not   directly attempted to speed up microscopic simulation algorithms; instead, a hierarchy  of new coarse-grained  stochastic models (referred to as Coarse Grained Monte Carlo methods) is derived, ordered by the magnitude of space/time scales. This new set of models involves  a reduced set of observables over the original  microscopic models incorporating microscopic details and noise, as well as\r\nthe interaction of the unresolved degrees of freedom. (ii)   Hybrid    stochastic/deterministic systems describing detailed fluid-surface interactions arise in applications that range from deposition process and catalysis to fuel cell design and microreactors, to  biology and  atmosphere and ocean science. Here two such applications are addressed, namely catalytic reactors and stochastic parametrizations of tropical convection.\r\nDue to their inherent complexity it is also necessary to develop simpler,  test bed problems that capture significant features of  the multi-scale nature of the physical models, but  are still amenable to asymptotics, mathematical analysis and  tractable computations.\r\n\r\nThe modeling and simulation of problems with multiple interrelating length and time scales is one of the preeminent issues in essentially all timely scientific and engineering challenges, ranging from the design of  nanodevices, to biomolecular  dynamics, to the spread of epidemics  and  climate modeling. In spite of  a continuously increasing  computing power many of these problems remain  intractable, at least in realistic conditions, and new modeling and  simulation  strategies  need to be developed. As several paradigms\r\nhave recently demonstrated, the critical step in this process is the use of (the limited in number and flexibility) existing multiscale mathematical and statistical tools as well as the development of  new ones, that enable the creation of new algorithms for complex systems. In the proposed work an array of such novel multiscale mathematics and computing methods is developed. The research is motivated by and targeted  to a\r\nnumber of the aforementioned applications. Two such particular examples  are, (i) the surface processes  in catalytic reactors and fuel cells, and  (ii) the  tropical and open ocean  convection.\r\n",
