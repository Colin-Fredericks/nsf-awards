Many important problems in complex and algebraic\r\ngeometry concern the construction of holomorphic objects such as\r\nholomorphic sections of line bundles or maps between spaces.  It often\r\nhappens that the construction problem simplifies as the degree of the\r\nline bundles or maps increases.  A classical example is the Kodaira\r\nembedding theorem, which says that there are enough sections of a high\r\npower of a positive line bundle to embed a Kahler manifold into\r\nprojective space. Asymptotic results in general concern the properties\r\nof maps or sections of very high degree, where constructions often\r\nsimplify. Effective results ask for the smallest power or degree where \r\na desired effect takes place, e.g. the smallest power of a line bundle \r\nso that sections embed.  Many such results will be surveyed in our\r\nconference, with techniques ranging from partial differential equations\r\nto geometric and algebraic methods.\r\n\r\nOur conference consists of seven days of lectures, with six to eight\r\nlectures a day. There will be lectures surveying past results and others which present new results.  The topics include complexity of\r\nzero-finding algorithms, moduli spaces, holomorphic maps, ground states\r\nof superconductors, and the vacuum selection problem in string theory.\r\nThe lectures will expose the field to graduate students, postdoctoral\r\nresearchers and junior faculty members, as well as to senior\r\nmathematicians.  Two graduate students and at least five postdocs are\r\ngiving lectures.  A significant portion of our funding will go towards\r\npaying travel expenses of graduate students, young mathematicians and\r\nmembers of under-represented groups.\r\n\r\n",
