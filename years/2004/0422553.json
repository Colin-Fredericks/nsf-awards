 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objectives of the proposed work are to achieve a fundamental understanding of the novel Lotus Effect coating, and to implement the Lotus Effect coating in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) for stiction prevention. Possessing two indispensable characteristic properties: superhydrophobicity and self-cleaning, the Lotus Effect materials have a great potential as an anti-stiction coating for MEMS. The PI proposes novel approaches to produce Lotus Effect surfaces, including creating nanoscale roughness on a hydrophobic surface by plasma, and coating functional self-assembled monolayers on nanoporous substrates. The fundamental mechanism of the superhydrophobicity and the self-cleaning process of Lotus Effect materials will be studied through the mathematic modeling of the relationship between surface morphology, surface wetting, and surface adhesion. \r\n\r\nThe Lotus Effect coating is an excellent example of bio-mimic nano-materials. The proposed research work will add to the knowledge base of the nano surface engineering and contribute to the progress of novel material development through bio-mimicking processes. In addition, the superhydrophobic and self-cleaning coatings will have wide applications on glass, ceramics, textiles, building materials, boat, airplane, automobiles and other surfaces, to reduce or eliminate the efforts and expenses of routine cleaning, as such, they will reduce the energy and detergent usages, and thus will benefit our society and environment. This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) grant provides an industrial-university linkage between Georgia Institute of Technology and nGimat Co. and will enhance technology transfer. \r\n",
