 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the 17th consecutive year we are organizing the InternationalWorkshop on Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing. This workshop covers all aspects of languages, compiler techniques, run-time environments, and architectures for parallel and high-performance computing. Since 1988, the annual LCPC workshops have provided a forum for leading researchers and practitioners to present their latest work and to exchange ideas about future directions. The papers published in the proceedings of the workshop have been widely cited over the years and many of them have represented the _rst public presentation\r\nof innovative ideas. The participation is truly international with speakers from the US, Japan\r\nand Europe.\r\nWhile the workshop covers many topics, the emphasis has always been software, e.g., compilers, languages, run-time systems, performance evaluation for parallel systems.\r\nOne of the most important aspects of this workshop is its informal setting which allows a frank exchange of new, previously unpublished ideas. Moreover, LCPC has also been an occasion for graduate students to meet more senior researchers in this informal setting.\r\n",
