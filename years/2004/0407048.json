 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to the University of Colorado at Boulder supports Professors Conrad R. Stoldt (Mechanical Engineering), Kenneth A. Gall (Mechanical Engineering), and Roop L. Mahajan (Mechanical Engineering) to enable the College of Engineering and Applied Science (CEAS) to integrate nanoscale science and engineering into its curricula at both the freshman and sophomore levels. A collaborative effort with the Integrated Teaching and Learning Laboratory (ITLL) in the CEAS will be cultivated to develop and integrate multiple nanotechnology-based learning modules into the first year General Engineering and Mechanical Engineering (ME) curriculum. Concurrently, a second-year physical science course will be developed and introduced in ME to provide undergraduate students with an in-depth introduction to nanoscale science and engineering.  \r\n\r\nThe success of this first- and second-year educational plan will be evaluated in part by monitoring individual student enrollment in existing upper-division ME nanotechnology courses and independent research projects. Additionally, there will be active collaboration with the Women in Engineering Program (WIEP) and Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP) in the CEAS to encourage strong underrepresented student participation in the proposed nanotechnology education initiative.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education announcement, NSF 03-444, category NUE and was jointly funded by the Division of Civil and Mechanical Systems (CMS) and the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) in the Directorate for Engineering.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
