 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF-REU Site Program will provide support for ten students to conduct full-time (ten weeks) independent research collaboratively with a faculty member from within the College of Science at Weber State University in Ogden, UT.  Students participating in this program will conduct research on the biology of the Greater Salt Lake Ecosystems (GSLE).  Research will be conducted on a diversity of taxa and at different levels of organization, from the molecular level to the ecosystem level. The Great Salt Lake (GSL) is located in western North America at the eastern edge of the Great Basin. The western boundary of the GSL is bounded by the Great Basin Desert. This area is a vast complex of playas and includes several unique plant species. The eastern boundary of the GSL valley is formed by the Wasatch Range of the Rocky Mountains. The lake is tied to the Wasatch Range by a series of streams and rivers that drain into it. In the desert west, these rivers create ribbons of riparian habitat, which are critical migratory and breeding habitats for a variety of wildlife. Furthermore, these upland areas provide linking habitat types that create the highly productive marsh ecosystems surrounding the lake. The GSLE supports a diverse biota in a unique mosaic of upland, wetland, mudflat, river delta, brackish and freshwater marshes, ephemeral ponds and other habitat types.  Our focus on the biology of the GSLE will foster a sense of community among student researchers who will be engaged in answering questions and testing hypotheses centered on a common theme. In addition, students will gain a working knowledge of, and an appreciation for, a unique and important area. The REU student will participate in a(n): orientation, seminars on the Biology of the Greater Salt Lake Ecosystems, Research Tools Workshop, course on Research Ethics, field trips, social events, and an end-of-program symposium.  Each student will pursue independent research under the supervision of a faculty mentor. Students will learn the process of science by active involvement in research and come to understand the sense of community that cooperation in research promotes. After the summer program, students will have the opportunity to attend a professional meeting to present their research to national or international audiences. Women and underrepresented minorities, nontraditional students, and students from institutions where research opportunities are limited are strongly encouraged to apply.  Visit our NSF-REU website (http://departments.weber.edu/zoology/REU.htm) for more information on mentors and for an application.  Point-of-contact for the WSU Summer REU Program is Dr. John F. Cavitt, at 801-626-6172 or jcavitt@weber.edu.",
