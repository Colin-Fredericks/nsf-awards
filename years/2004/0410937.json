 "awd_abstract_narration": "Margaret Martonosi, Princeton University, Adaptive, Power-Efficeint Processors for Sensors and Embedded Systems  \r\n\r\nSensor network systems have seen increasing research attention recently, \r\nwith a wide range of scientific and commercial applications. Sensor \r\nprocessors need \"agile\" performance that responds quickly to \r\nhigh-throughput bursts, with also lower-energy execution when\r\npossible to minimize energy consumption. Sensor systems have \r\nlimited power budgets, with traditionally most energy going to \r\nradio communications. But as radios improve and computational\r\ndemands increase, more of the energy budget is shifting back\r\nto the processor.\r\n\r\nThis research examines processor architectures for agile,\r\nenergy-efficient, stream-based processing in sensor networks\r\nand other embedded systems. A particular focus is on using\r\nparallelism (through tiled processing units) for energy management.\r\nAnother key aspect is investigating the interconnect between on-chip\r\nprocessing units, and exploring design techniques that let different\r\nprocessing elements run at different clock rates. Connecting processing elements by \r\na system of hardware queues, for example, allows the chip to exploit \r\na thread-based, producer-consumer model to adapt processor settings\r\nto running threads; this enables efficient energy and speed control\r\nvia dynamic voltage/frequency scaling. By exposing\r\nqueue/memory status to near neighbors, processors can use\r\ncontrol theoretic approaches to coordinate performance/energy\r\nneeds across local and broader regions. \r\n\r\nMajor research questions include: (i) How much on-chip parallelism\r\nbest balances application performance and energy? (ii) What range of applications \r\nare applicable to this model? (iii) How to design performance and\r\npower-efficient speed-control models based on local and global\r\ncontrol approaches? (iv) What are the roles of distributed and\r\nhierarchical control techniques? (v) Can control theoretic\r\napproaches be devised that offer good responsiveness and stability\r\nin the face of sensing errors and sensing/actuation delays?\r\n",
