 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) This comprehensive effort focuses on improving traditional recitation sections and laboratories in an introductory calculus-based physics sequence.  Such laboratories and recitations are demonstrably ineffective at developing students' conceptual mastery of physics and expectations of learning physics.  However, proven solutions, in the form of Tutorials in Introductory Physics from the University of Washington require demands of the university that cannot immediately be provided -- particularly, the number and training of adequately prepared instructors or TA's.  This adaptation and implementation effort creates a long-term solution by institutionalizing a unified, transformed course experience that ultimately demands no more resources of the university than presently allotted.  The assembled research team is implementing Tutorials in Introductory Physics, which are among the most deeply researched and widely used, effective reforms of traditional physics recitation sections.  These reforms are being coupled with a revised laboratory sequence using Maryland's Activity Based Physics that emphasizes sense making and experimentation, with the goal of marked improvement in students' conceptual mastery of physics and in students' expectations of what it means to learn physics.  \r\n\r\nSignificantly, these transformations are supported and sustained by a new advanced course in teaching and learning physics.  The new physics course, Teaching and Learning Physics, is modeled on a proven activity designed to train upper division undergraduates and graduate students in physics education research and reforms.  The course includes a 'practicum' component where students serve as learning assistants (LA's) to supplement departmentally appointed teaching assistants.  Three CU physics faculty members lead this effort by: teaching the lecture course sequence, adapting Tutorials, restructuring the laboratories, and implementing the course Teaching and Learning Physics.  Evaluation of this project is conducted to assess the effectiveness of these reforms on improving student conceptual mastery, student expectations, graduate student effectiveness and understanding, and course structural formation and institutionalization.  Local complementary resources - funding for equipment, faculty interest and expertise in reform, and synergistic research efforts - insure that CU is well positioned and committed to successful adaptation and implementation of these proven models.  Finally, this grant is resulting in a model of course-wide, sustainable reform that is being disseminated broadly through presentations at AAPT meetings and through appropriate peer-reviewed journals such as AJP. \r\n",
