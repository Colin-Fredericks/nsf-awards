 "awd_abstract_narration": "3This MRI award supports the acquisition of an Element2, double-focusing HR-ICPMS and additional equipment to be operated in parallel with the existing ICP instruments. Given the high cost of collecting and storing ice cores -and their potential to provide highly detailed information on past atmospheric chemistry, atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and anthropogenic pollution across a wide range of temporal and spatial scale - it is clear that the best possible analytical procedures and instrumentation for ice core analyses are warranted, particularly for deep cores such as the upcoming Inland bedrock ice core in West Antarctica where sample availability is very limited.  The scientific merit of this project is that two parallel HR-ICP-MS instruments operating in real time would allow improved, targeted measurements of a more comprehensive suite of elements on a single ice core sample than is possible with one HR-ICP-MS. It would also allow for additional analyses (e.g., soluble iron [Fe] and Fe speciation) since the HR-ICP-MS requires only 40% as much sample volume as the ICP-OES. NSF support for the proposed instrument acquisition will result in significant advances in the study of past climates, oceanic and atmospheric circulation, atmospheric chemistry, and anthropogenic pollution using glaciochemistry.  The availability of a second HR-ICP-MS will further improve and expand research capabilities for DRI and University and Community College System of Nevada (UCCSN) faculty working in various fields (e.g., pollution aerosols in precipitation, groundwater fingerprinting, determination of sources of colloidal material in surface waters, trace element/tree ring analysis with implications for environmental health, trace element analysis in archeology).  A related broader impact is that this will allow the institution to attract new faculty (with a goal of increasing diversity).  This will also improve and expand opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students throughout the state.\r\n\r\n",
