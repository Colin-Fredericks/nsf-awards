 "awd_abstract_narration": "As multimedia processing and networking technologies, products and\r\nservices evolve, the number of people communicating interactively\r\nis growing rapidly. Consequently, multimedia communication\r\nservices are starting to consume a considerable share of the\r\nbackbone traffic. This highlights the problem of transmitting\r\nreal-time media efficiently. Effective multimedia communication\r\ndemands appropriate media-aware and application-specific\r\nsolutions, without which the full benefits of such services will\r\nnot be realized. Poor approaches often lead to such system\r\nperformance degradations as unacceptable presentation quality\r\nperceived by the clients, possible network collapse due to the\r\nhigh-bandwidth nature of multimedia applications, and poor\r\nperformance observed by other network flows due to the\r\nunresponsiveness of such applications.\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that existing protocol suites are unable to provide\r\nthe desired features, the study of media-aware transport protocols\r\nis overdue. The focus of this research is on the design and\r\nevaluation of end-to-end solutions for reliable multimedia\r\nservices. Nonetheless, it is a challenging task to develop a\r\ngeneric solution that can satisfy the needs of the broad range of\r\nmultimedia applications available today. Such an approach would\r\nresult either in an unnecessarily complicated protocol that is far\r\nbeyond real implementation or in a very high-level one that cannot\r\nexploit the specific features of the media. The investigators' aim\r\nis to develop a suite of Multimedia Transport Protocols (MMTP)\r\nthat integrate media properties, application requirements, and\r\nnetwork characteristics in such a way that the presentation\r\nquality is optimal in the rate-distortion sense.",
