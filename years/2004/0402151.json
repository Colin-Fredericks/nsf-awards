 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experiments in meson spectroscopy test critical aspects of the standard\r\ntheory of the strong nuclear force.  Although they only live for a short\r\ntime before they decay, mesons provide a unique laboratory for the study\r\nof the strong force because they are the simplest quark configuration,\r\njust a one quark and one antiquark.  The GlueX experiment is a major new\r\ninitiative being undertaken at Jefferson Lab in Newport News, Virginia\r\nusing polarized photons from the CEBAF electron accelerator to search\r\nfor a new class of excitations known as exotic mesons.  Although exotics\r\nwere predicted based upon the standard theory over 20 years ago,\r\nconclusive experimental evidence for their existence has not yet been\r\nestablished.  The P.I. is a member of the governing board of the GlueX\r\nexperiment and has specific responsibility in the design and\r\nconstruction of the polarized photon source.  A preliminary step towards\r\nthe larger goals of GlueX was the Radphi experiment was constructed\r\nstudy the decays of a known meson, the phi(1020).  The phi itself is not\r\nexotic, but some evidence pointed to the possible exotic nature of two\r\nother mesons at around the same mass, the a0(980) and the f0(980).  \r\nRadiative decays of the phi to these scalars provide an important test\r\nof this hypothesis. The experiment collected its data during a 60-day\r\nrun in summer 2000, and is in the final stages of data analysis.  The\r\nP.I. is also involved in the Qweak experiment at Jefferson Lab, which\r\nundertakes a precise measurement of the weak charge of the proton as a\r\nsearch for physics beyond the Standard Model.  In this project he has\r\nshared responsibility for the Compton-backscatter electron polarimeter.\r\n\r\n",
