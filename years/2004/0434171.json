 "awd_abstract_narration": "Six 0434171 \r\n\r\nThis award supports an international collaborative research investigation on Dendroctonus bark beetle-fungus symbioses. These symbioses include interactions among beetles and fungi from three distinct groups, as well as with phoretic (hitchhiker) fungus-feeding mites. In collaboration with Dr. Michael Wingfield at the University of Pretoria in South Africa, we propose to develop a molecular phylogeny of the Ophiostoma fungal associates for comparison with a phylogeny of the beetles. Such comparisons yield insights into evolutionary histories and relationships of interacting organisms. Future work will include the other fungal groups and the mites. Using a multi-species approach will allow a broader and more accurate interpretation of how symbiotic assemblages form, are maintained, and evolve over time. The collaboration brings together two experts on these systems, Six from the USA specializing in beetle-fungus symbioses, and Wingfield from South Africa specializing in Ophiostoma systematics.\r\n\r\nThis research will increase our knowledge of an economically and ecologically important group of insects - Dendroctonus are the most economically damaging of North American forest insects but also function as natural disturbance agents that determine forest structure and composition. The research will also help identify factors influencing the development, evolution, and maintenance of symbioses, en ecologically and economically important type of species interactions. The project involves collaboration between a researcher and four students from the USA and several top researchers in South Africa. It will aid the professional development and training of two MS students and two PhD students including one from a traditionally under-represented group (Native American). \r\n",
