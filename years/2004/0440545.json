 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe global theory of minimal surfaces in space is in a phase of\r\nexplosive growth.  Many new methods of constructing complete\r\nembedded minimal surfaces have recently been found; in place of a\r\ndearth of examples just a few years ago, we now have a quite\r\nvaried collection of surfaces, including infinite families. A\r\nbasic problem is to classify these examples, i.e. collect them\r\ninto families with common properties and understood\r\nlimits. Fruitful approaches have recently been developed that\r\ncombine numerical simulation with methods from the theory of\r\ngeometric structures on surfaces and classical complex analysis,\r\nnotably Teichmuller theory. Some of the problems the team will\r\nattack are: Are there embedded minimal surfaces with one\r\nheliciodal end and arbitrary genus? Is the classical Scherk\r\nsurface the unique desingularization of a pair of planes?  Of\r\nwhat families is the Scherk surface the limit point? At the same\r\ntime, the group hopes to make progress on simulation of minimal\r\nsurfaces. For example, we hope to set up a library of Weierstrass\r\nrepresentations of minimal surfaces which is reproducible, fully\r\ndocumented, and useful as a research tool.\r\n\r\nA guiding philosophy in many areas of science, from physics to\r\nbiochemistry to ecology, is that nature is maximally efficient;\r\nindeed, many explanations of natural phenomena have at their\r\nfoundation the assumption that the phenomenon has optimized some\r\nor several of its features in the expression we witness.  At its\r\nbase, this philosophical principle is mathematical in nature: we\r\nsearch for principles in science that can be formulated as\r\nextremal problems. In mathematics, we can make this assumption of\r\noptimality very rigorous by expressing it as an equation.  This\r\nleaves us with the problem of understanding all of the solutions\r\nof that equation. In this project, we aim to study one very rich\r\ntype of optimization problem, the minimal surface problem, which\r\nis already known to have a number of quite subtle\r\ncharacteristics. (A minimal surface is one for which each small\r\npiece has less area than any other surface with the same\r\nboundary.) The study of these surfaces has its origins in\r\nphysical problems studied first by Euler; then, a century later,\r\nthe problem also arose in the studies of the behavior of rotating\r\ndroplets and soap films by F. Plateau. Today the applications\r\nrange from cosmology to the understanding of the structure of\r\nstable periodic structures in compound copolymers. As in many\r\nother optimization problems, for the minimal surface problem, we\r\ndo not have much general information about solutions to the\r\nequation expressing extremality. At present though, we do have a\r\nwide variety of examples which help to guide our intuition, and\r\nwhich we are beginning to organize. It is thus a good model\r\nproblem, enriching our understanding of all optimization\r\nproblems.\r\n",
