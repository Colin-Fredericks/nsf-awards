 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF-Europe award to University of Florida is to develop and characterize large superalloy single crystals based on nickel.  With this collaborative research with Imperial College (UK) and industry [Siemens Westinghouse Power Corp. (Orlando FL); Solar Turbines (San Diego, CA); Pratt Whitney (East Hartford)], the PIs will identify mechanisms that underlie the effect of alloying additions of refractory elements such as tungsten, rhenium and ruthenium for processing and properties.  In addition, grain boundary modifiers such as Boron and Hafnium, and Cobalt will be alloyed to increase microstructural stability. Processing methods will be developed to produce large single crystal superalloys for potential applications in turbine blades, which would have technological and scientific relevance for power generation systems.  Future power generation systems will require large single crystal castings that are defect free and capable of operating at higher temperatures for longer periods of time than current alloys. \r\n\r\nWith this award, enhanced educational and research experience would be available to high school, undergraduate and graduate students.  Existing and effective programs operating at University of Florida will be utilized to recruit and train a diverse student body including minority students and women, and activities of these students supported by this award would have a significant positive impact on the materials science and other related disciplines.  Getting these students involved at an early age in science and technology, and educating them for future employment in important technological sectors would be an expected outcome of this award.",
