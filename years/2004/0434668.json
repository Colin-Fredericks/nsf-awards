Last year's conference in Miami had more than 120 attendees. This\r\nproposal requests funding to aid graduate students enrolled in institutions in the United States in\r\nattending this premiere conference. Attending conferences such as IMC is of paramount\r\nimportance for graduate students pursuing research in the field. Authors have the opportunity to\r\npresent their work and all attendees have a chance to interact with many others performing\r\nleading-edge research in the field.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will serve to widen the audience attending the Internet\r\nMeasurement Conference, raising the level of interaction and the potential for new collaboration,\r\nnew investigations, and higher quality research.\r\n\r\nThis proposal, by enabling students to attend who might not otherwise be able,\r\nwill increase the dissemination of the conference's research results to a larger and more diverse\r\naudience. By giving preference in grant awards to women and minority students, we hope to\r\nwiden the participation among these underrepresented groups. Furthermore, by advertising to a\r\nwide range of colleges and universities, participants from a more diverse set of institutions should\r\nbe able to attend and benefit from the conference. \r\n\r\n",
