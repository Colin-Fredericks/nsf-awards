 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to the University of Tennessee Knoxville for a Conceptual Design and Engineering study for a next generation, time of flight (TOF) neutron vibrational spectrometer, VISION, to be located at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS).  This instrument will be used to investigate the molecular dynamics and structures of a vast array of condensed matter systems. Under optimal conditions this instrument will: (1) have two orders of magnitude greater throughput than the best instrument that currently exists; (2) cover an energy transfer range of 0-500 meV (0-4000 cm -1); (3) have a 1-2% energy resolution while simultaneously enabling diffraction studies for structural characterization; and (3) offer a wide range of sample environments (low temperature, high-pressure, flow cell, thermal analysis, etc).\r\n\r\nThe design will introduce neutron techniques developed during the decade since the Time of Flight Crystal Analyzer (TFXA) and TOSCA instruments. These include improved supermirror technology, parametrically matched crystal analyzer-helium gas detectors, efficient electronics for high rate data acquisition, high performance data analysis algorithms, novel moderator concepts, as well as the use of well-developed Monte Carlo software for neutron optics and instrument design and optimization. For the first time the flux available at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) will enable time-resolved vibrational neutron measurements.\r\n\r\nThe research activities associated with the VISION spectrometer and conceptual\r\ndesign and engineering project involve scientific studies that have intellectual merit on many levels. Not only will these activities advance our fundamental understanding of the structure and dynamics of entire classes of materials in areas such as biochemistry, catalysis, materials science, geology, polymers and engineering but it will lead to also lead to new discoveries.\r\n\r\nFinally, the VISION instrument will introduce a new generation of students\r\n(Undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers) and researchers (both\r\nacademic and industrial) to the use of neutron vibrational spectroscopy in the study of new materials and a wide range of engineering problems, especially those where the  materials have interesting structure and dynamics on the nanometer length scale and topics of commercial importance. These activities by the current and next generation scientists are certain to return the U.S. to its once preeminent role in neutron scattering.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an award to the University of Tennessee Knoxville for a Conceptual Design and Engineering study for a next generation, time of flight (TOF) neutron vibrational spectrometer, VISION, to be located at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS).
