 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project represents a multiple year effort to develop a theoretical and practical framework for the design and analysis of scalable ad hoc networks.  The research focuses on cross-layer interactions and fundamental limitations.  The research objectives are to develop rigorous approaches for determining bounds on systems performance and to develop algorithms to optimize achievable capacity and perform robust admission control for QoS traffic based on the novel cross-layer concept of deferral-sets.  These goals are based on the critical need for a theoretical basis for consistent design and evaluation methodologies that reflect fundamental system invariants and the impact of mobility, media access control and cross-layer interaction.  Novel inter-layer services will be developed that may be used to provide statistical QoS guarantees. By demonstrating the ability to provide statistically bounded service guarantees, the proposed investigation has the potential to change the perception of ad hoc networking in fundamental ways and thus increase the scope of both basic research and applications involving these networks.  This effort will have impact beyond the area of wireless networks. Successful large-scale deployments of any network, not only ad hoc networks, will naturally spur the development of novel applications. For example, the global Internet has revolutionized the way mankind conducts business, disseminates knowledge, teaches courses, and runs governments in less than three decades. In addition, this effort will provide undergraduate students with new opportunities to participate in research oriented projects that focus on the critical areas under investigation in this project.",
