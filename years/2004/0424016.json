 "awd_abstract_narration": "The workshop will be held in June 2004 in Roscoff, France. The first meeting in this series will be entitled \"Picophytoplankton: from ecology to genomics\". This award will provide partial support for the participation of invited speakers, discussion leaders and young investigators. The objective of this conference is to explore original concepts in pico-phytoplankton research with a view to unifying the outcomes that have emerged from separate disciplines in the past two decades. For the first time, leading researchers from all major areas of picophytoplankton study will be gathered together at a GRC, which offers a unique forum for open discussion. The plan of this 5-day conference is to explore topic areas tat include taxonomic diversity, molecular approaches, physiology, ecology, and genomics. The goals of the conference are to promote learning and participant diversity, and attendance will be open to scientists, technologists and educators from academia, government and industry. A forum is thus provided for support and encouragement of young scientists as they establish initial scientific and personal contacts. The large number of participants will allow registrants to be drawn from underrepresented groups and from a wide geographic base. The conference also provides an opportunity to enhance infrastructure for research and education, and will provide a venue where US academic institutions, industry and government are able to network with international partners.",
