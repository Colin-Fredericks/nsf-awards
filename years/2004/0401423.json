Vary, Department of Physics at Iowa State University at Ames, Iowa and Dr. Mahmoud Hasan, Department of Physics, Applied Science University, in Amman, Jordan.   They plan to apply microscopic many-body theory to predict the quantum statistical properties of medium weight nuclei with a focus on Iron-56. In the past five years progress has been made in addressing the problems associated with the millions of levels in medium-mass nuclei.  The PIs will investigate these same issues at high excitation. The research would have implications both for the understanding of the dynamics of supernova explosions and for the understanding of nuclear reactions at high energy transfer.  \r\n\r\nScope:  The area of study is ripe for major theoretical advances. Dr. Vary has an excellent record of original and creative research, and includes students in his research.  Prof. Hasan has a very strong background in the proposed work. The team is perfect for the successful completion of the project.  The international collaboration proposed here is appropriate for accomplishing the objectives of the proposed work, and it will help establish cooperation between two student-centered institutions.  \r\n",
