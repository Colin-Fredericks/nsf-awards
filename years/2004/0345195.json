 "awd_abstract_narration": "This pilot study seeks to determine empirically how large engineering-based academic research centers function from an organizational management perspective.  Using  sample of NSF-funded Engineering Research Centers (ERCs), the study will be pursure three lines of inquiry:  how strategic planning is done and the utility of the Three-Plane Chart conceptual model ERCs use to develop and portray their strategic plans; general management of technology within the centers, and the organizational effectiveness of ERCs. The methodology includes obtaining information in a variety of ways from personnel from active ERCs, particularly those involved in planning and management.  A combination of interviewing and surveying through questionnaires will be used to collect information about resistence to using the three-plane chart construct for planning, the alignment of center goals, personnel, and facilities; resource allocation; the involvement of stakeholders in planning; and data in the ERC Indicators Data.  A Technical Advisory Committee will ensure that the centers' research context will be included in this novel study of management of technology within large, complex engineering-based university-industry research centers.  The results will provide important information on strategic planning and management of technology are integrated in a  sample of academic research centers and implications for enhanced organizational effectiveness in this challenging management setting.",
