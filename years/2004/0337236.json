 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Coastal Communities for Science:  A Bering Sea Partnership\" is a 3-year program of collaboration among the WWF-US, four Alaska native rural communities and regional scientists investigating the ecology of the Bering Strait.  Its primary purpose is to advance youth interaction with science and it proposes to achieve this by engaging young people from high school and beyond to conduct research with scientists.  The project which involves training community youth on science and research methods, capacity building of informal educators in these rural communities to lead and encourage field-based programs, inclusion of community elders in the overall learning and communication of science concepts and the creation of a model of collaboration.  The science content, an amalgam of community interest and researcher interest, is grounded in local environmental and economic issues.  With WWF's support and electronic technology, this has the potential of being a model project that is broadly disseminated at local, regional and national levels.",
