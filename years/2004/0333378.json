 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many boundaries at  the chemistry-biology interface remain unexplored and represent unique opportunities  for the discovery  of  advanced  technologies  and  the  education  of  interdisciplinary  scientists  and  engineers.  Oxidation processes occur within both synthetic macromolecules and biological systems, offering a common theoretical base.  Oxygen-centered  radicals  are  implicated  as  intermediates  in  key  chemical  and  biological  processes  such  as  lipid oxidation, cellular aging and product deterioration, as well as certain enzyme-mediated processes. The profound irony underlying all oxidation chemistry is that, in general terms at least, the same element that nature uses to sustain and  regenerate  life  also  plays  a  role  in  aging,  disease,  and  death.  Oxidative  stress  is  implicated  in many  chronic diseases,  including  cancer,  diabetes,  obesity  and  the  compromise  of  immune  function.    These  chronic  diseases contribute significantly to the projected $1.6 trillion in health care costs at the national level in 2003, costing 15% of \r\nthe national gross product.  The development of antioxidant delivery systems, including antioxidant enriched foods, novel biocompatible synthetic polymer delivery systems, or new natural and synthetic macromolecular antioxidants would have major applications in combating oxidation-based diseases and aging.   \r\nThe goal of the MILES Program is to construct a unique educational framework and collaborative research program, using  free  radical  and  oxidative  processes  as  the  thematic  basis  for  scientific  connectivity  that  bridges  the  gap between traditional macromolecular science and evolving biological disciplines. \r\n \r\nIntegration of Research and Education \r\n \r\nFifteen  interdisciplinary  research  faculty  in  four  colleges  at  Virginia  Tech  will  collaborate  with  domestic  and international  universities,  industries  and  national  laboratories  to  provide  unique  cooperative  research, multidisciplinary education, and outreach experiences for 36 graduate students. The Program will prepare doctoral-level candidates in chemistry, engineering, and life sciences as future leaders in academia, industry and government. The  research  efforts will  include  basic  through  applied  research  in  four  areas:  1)  Fundamental  investigations  of oxygen-centered free radical mechanisms; 2) Oxidation in bio-derived monomers and macromolecular synthesis; 3) Oxidation  control mechanisms  in  complex matrices;  and  4)  Oxidation  processes  in  human  and  animal  aging  and disease.  \r\n \r\nThe goals of the program are to: 1) Expand fundamental understanding and scientific vision of the macromolecule-biomolecule  interface;  2)  Develop  creative  and  analytical  thinking;  3)  Integrate  advanced  research  training with ethics education; 4) Develop practical skills in communications; 5) Enhance teamwork and develop leadership; 5) Promote diversity in culture and worldview; 6) Construct new avenues for community outreach; and 8) Create novel mechanisms  to  attract  academically  gifted  students  to  graduate  school.  In  order  to  be awarded  a MILES  program certificate,  students  will  be  required  to  submit  an  electronic  portfolio  that  documents  successful  completion  of required elements and optional selections that meet both the program goals and the individualized interests of the student.    Unique  outreach  programs  incorporate  partnerships with  the  Science  Museum  of  Western  Virginia,  the Collaborative Laboratory with historically black colleges, and domestic and international industry internships. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\n \r\nThe  university.s  education  and  research  infrastructure  will  be  strengthened  considerably  by  an  interdisciplinary program  design  that  crosses  the  boundaries  of  traditional  academic  disciplines.  Broad  societal  impact will  result from improved control of free radical and oxidative processes in biological and macromolecular systems, yielding important  advances  in  nutrition,  biomedical  science  and  engineering,  food  biochemistry  and  functionality,  and sustainable  polymeric  materials  from  bio-derived  precursors.  This  training  program  will  contribute  to  a  new generation of professionals prepared to move society forward into an era of sustained health, well-being, and quality of life through technological advancements.  Ultimately, the program will equip future scientists and engineers with the broad-based skills necessary to transcend conventional boundaries.",
