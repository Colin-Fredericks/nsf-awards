 "awd_abstract_narration": "We are requesting funding for the second Workshop on Genomic Signal Processing and Statistics (GENSIPS), which is planned for May 26-28, 2004.  The workshop will be held on the Homewood campus of The Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland.  The aim of this three-day workshop is to provide a forum for presenting new results on genomic signal processing and statistics and identify potential areas of research and collaboration between the biological, statistical, and signal processing communities.  The workshop has been approved as an IEEE Signal Processing Society cooperating meeting and has a significant tutorial component with the aim to educate, to bring awareness of genomics problems to the signal processing and statistics communities, and to stimulate collaborative research in this area.  We are planning to invite ten internationally renowned researchers to deliver plenary talks covering all three areas of interest: biology, signal processing and statistics.  Contributed poster sessions and a round-table discussion session will also be featured in the technical program.  Support from DARPA, NSF and the Whitaker foundation is sought to help defray registration fees and travel expenses for invited speakers and a few students, as well as anticipated costs associated with the planning and the logistical issues related to holding a successful meeting.",
