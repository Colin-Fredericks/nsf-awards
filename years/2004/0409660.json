 "awd_abstract_narration": "0409660 - Nonlinear dynamics of microcantilevers interacting with nanostructures - applications to biomolecular sensing and nanotribology\r\nThis project explores computationally, and experimentally novel dynamical phenomena underlying the use of scanning probe microcantilevers as mechanical property sensors at the nanoscale. The proposed research targets two applications of key importance in nanostructural property characterization: (a) the measurement and characterization of friction at the nanoscale, and (b) the measurement of mechanical properties of biological macromolecules. In both cases, investigations will be performed to predict the oscillations of microcantilevers in these nanoscale measurement applications. \r\n\r\nOverall the project will (1) help develop a fundamantal understanding of the physics of atomic scale friciton betweena sharp asperity and nanostructures of interest, especially in sliding speeds of relevance to nanotribology, MEMS and biomolecular systems, (2) help develop design guidelines to tune intentionally the vibration spectrum of these microcantilevers to enhance their performance as nanomechanical property sensors of important biomolecules such as structural proteins and DNA. Finally, the research objectives are complemented by a solid plan for broader impact including specific plans for broader dissemination of research results, increasing participation of minorites and underrepresented groups in research, involving undergraduates in research, and fostering cross disciplinary collaborations with structural biology and condensed matter physics communities on campus. \r\n",
