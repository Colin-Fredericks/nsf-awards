 "awd_abstract_narration": "What is lost when a language dies? Languages are becoming extinct at a \r\nmuch higher rate than biological species, and each time this happens, \r\nthe connection of a people with their history, traditional knowledge \r\nand cultural heritage is severed. Each language is a unique \r\ncombination of the possibilities offered by the human language faculty, \r\nand each language that dies reduces the evidence available for the \r\nnature of that faculty. Many of the world's endangered languages are \r\nthose of tribal peoples in remote places, but many more are spoken \r\nright alongside what we think of as major languages. Indeed, this very \r\nproximity is a major reason, in many cases, for the endangered status \r\nof local or minority languages. With support from the National Science \r\nFoundation, Dr. Stephen Anderson will carry out field studies of \r\nSurmiran, one of five major forms of Rumantsch in Switzerland. Intense \r\nlinguistic pressure from speakers of Italian and especially German \r\nmakes it extremely difficult for the 3,000 or so speakers of this \r\nlanguage to maintain their Rumantsch identity. The language has a \r\nnumber of features that make it quite important, though, both for the \r\nstudy of Romance languages and for linguistic theory more generally.  \r\nFor example, Rumantsch is the only modern Romance language that \r\nconsistently requires the verb of the sentence to appear in second \r\nposition, in a way similar to (but subtly different from) German.  \r\nSurmiran has a system of weak (or \"clitic\") pronouns that appear \r\ntogether with a full expression referring to the subject under complex \r\nconditions related to a number of other grammatical properties. The \r\nlanguage also has sound types that are quite unusual both in themselves \r\nand in the ways they form groups (or clusters). In every area of its \r\ngrammar, Surmiran Rumantsch has something to show us about the range of \r\npossibilities for human language that we might well never know if the \r\nlanguage disappeared before it could be investigated.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide documentation of the features of the language \r\nat several levels. For linguists, technical analyses of its \r\npeculiarities and their relevance to important theoretical issues will \r\nbring a new set of data into discussion in the field. For speakers of \r\nthe language, a grammatical description will be provided which can play \r\na role in language courses in the educational system, as well as \r\nproviding a convenient reference. It is often the case that the mere \r\nfact of devoting scientific attention to an endangered language can \r\nhave the effect of awakening pride and interest in the community, as \r\nthey realize that their language is not simply a marginal \"dialect\" but \r\na special and valuable kind of knowledge, structurally as rich and \r\nvaried as those with more prestige, and especially valuable to them as \r\nthe vehicle in which their own culture is expressed. In addition to \r\nproviding resources to these two communities, linguists on the one hand \r\nand Surmiran speakers on the other, this project will also provide \r\nopportunities for graduate students to participate directly in research \r\nwith both a basic and an applied character.\r\n\r\n",
