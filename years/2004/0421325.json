The new tool from Nanomasters Inc. incorporates a dual process-chamber setup and  allows for separation of carbon-rich and carbon-sensitive processing steps. Availability of this tool will forward a broad range of NSF-sponsored projects at UCR ranging from research in organic device components compatible with a semiconductor-processing environment to the development of a semiconductor-related curriculum at a institution that is located in an area which has one of the lowest rate of high school students continuing towards collegiate education.  \r\n\r\nThe Major Research Instrumentation program provides funding for the acquisition of a core semiconductor processing tool that is required for a semiconductor research training facility at the University of California at Riverside (UCR).
