 "awd_abstract_narration": "This effort would be a continuation of UNH studies of cosmic-ray modulation near the Earth. The global network of neutron monitors relies on both the Durham and Mt. Washington stations for standard data products. The PI plans on using data from Mt. Washington, Durham, and other ground-based neutron monitors, as well as spacecraft such as IMP and ACE. The Mt. Washington neutron monitor has operated continuously from 1954 to the present. The IMP spacecraft near the Earth provides data from 1972 to the present for >70 MeV particles, and for selected proton and helium energies. Data from the Milagro detector cover the energy range of >5 GeV, as well as provide estimates of the cutoff energies for some cosmic-ray modulation effects and increases associated with solar flares. These combined extended databases include 11-year and 22-year variations, as well as solar-flare events that occurred over the last several decades.  \r\n \r\nThis proposal aims at a better understanding of the linkages between processes of acceleration and transport of both solar and galactic cosmic rays in the heliosphere. By integrating data from a variety of cosmic-ray detectors, including neutron monitors, spacecraft instruments, and ground-level muon detectors, the PI will investigate the processes associated with the acceleration of solar cosmic rays by shocks in the heliosphere. Data from a single instrument can never adequately describe such processes, so the study of data from all available sources is critical for our understanding of these mechanisms. During the next two years, the PI plans to upgrade his software for data processing and analysis to more widely distribute user-friendly data sets and results. The paired stations in New Hampshire provide rare anisotropy-independent data for the community, while data from Milagro and Climax allow similar comparisons that can shed light on higher energy events. \r\n\r\nTwo undergraduates and one Ph.D. student already use these data for research, and the PI plans to utilize other undergraduates in the proposed study. Being collaborators in the Milagro experiment, the UNH team will have full access to the data and instrument expertise.",
