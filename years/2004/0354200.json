 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a synergistic effort of astronomical observations and laboratory spectroscopy. In the astronomical observations, the H3+ molecular ion, the simplest polyatomic species which is produced abundantly by cosmic ray ionization of H2, plays the central role. The large amount of observational data accumulated for H3+, as well as for the diffuse interstellar bands in the visible region of the spectrum, have revealed several new problems all related to the basics of physics, chemistry, and astronomy.  The laboratory and analytical efforts are geared to solve these problems and provide new molecular information for astronomical observations.  The project will analyze the thermalization of H3+ among the rotational levels, provide spectra of important molecular ions and radicals, and attempt to analyze and reproduce laboratory spectra for the diffuse interstellar bands. In terms of broader impact, this work provides an excellent vehicle for the education of students across multiple fields.  At the same time, disciplinary boundaries are broken down in the attempt to study two fields from a unified point of view.\r\nSupport for this project is provided by the Divisions of Physics, Chemistry, and Astronomy in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.\r\n",
