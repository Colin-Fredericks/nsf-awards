 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of computer-supported interaction has become a primary feature of communication among group members, due in part to its structural (freedom of time and geographical constraints) and psychological (anonymity) features.  As a consequence, many group researchers have investigated the role of group process variables in computer-supported interactions.  Because groups communicate via the use of computers in many personal, educational, and professional settings, it is important to continue and encourage the study of group processes in such environments. One theoretical issue that is implicit in many of the studies of group process variables in computer-supported interaction is whether technology is deterministic or determined.  Spears and Lea (1994) recognized this issue when discussing whether technology was a panacea, allowing for greater freedom of expression and equality of status, or a panopticon, limiting expression and increasing control due to its ability for surveillance.  The purpose of this conference is to bring together a diverse group of researchers with established programs of research on group processes in computer-supported interaction.  This conference should serve to make the theme of technological and social determinism more explicit, thus leading to greater unity in the dominant research programs.  The proposed conference offers a unique and timely theme, and is cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural.\r\n",
