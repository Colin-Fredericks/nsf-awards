 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal presents a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach to understanding a basic function of all neuronal sensory systems, namely, modification by experience and filtering of background or biologically irrelevant stimuli.  The proposal specifically focuses on odor habituation in rat olfactory bulb and cortex. The olfactory system represents an ideal system for such studies for several reasons, each of which is taken advantage of by the proposed studies.  First, the mammalian olfactory system is anatomically relatively simple, with the olfactory cortex one of the evolutionarily oldest mammalian sensory cortices.  Second, this relative simplicity has resulted in extensive knowledge of synaptic connections and physiology of both afferent and intracortical fiber systems and their regulation by neuromodulatory systems.  Third, this knowledge has allowed development of computational models which include both olfactory bulb and piriform cortical neurons.  Specifically the project will determine the synaptic mehcnaisms of odor habituation and odor-specificity of habituation in cortical neurons and then incorporate the electrophysiological results into a computational model of the cortex which will be used to make and test predictions about odor habituation and stimulus-background segmentation in an odor environment.  \r\n\r\nThe project combines the expertise of two active research groups specializing in sensory physiology and computational modeling.  This research environment will be used to expose students, high school through graduate from diverse backgrounds to new research techniques and conceptual approaches.\r\n",
