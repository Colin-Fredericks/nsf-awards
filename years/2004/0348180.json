 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Alkalithermophilic, chemolithoautotrophic Crenarchaeota\"is a mouthful to say, but it precisely describes the new types of microbes being sought by Drs. Chuanlun Zhang, Christopher Romanek, and Juergen Wiegel of the University of Georgia.  They have received a grant to study novel thermophilic (heat-loving) microorganisms in Nevada hot springs. Crenarchaeota are members of a poorly surveyed grouped of microorganisms in the domain Archaea.  These investigators will focus on alkalithermophilic Crenarchaeota - those that both grow at or above pH 8 and at or above 60oC.  Most of the known thermophilic Crenarchaeota have been found in low pH environments, while more alkaline habitats such as these have received less attention. Numerous hot springs located in the Sierra Nevada are alkaline and may be unique niches for Crenarchaeota. Based on their preliminary observations, the specific objectives of this project will further focus on the alkalithermophilic Crenarchaeota that are chemolithoautotrophic -which means that they obtain their carbon from CO2, and their energy by transforming inorganic substances such as nitrogen, iron or sulfur.  The team aims to determine the ecological functions and biogeochemical consequences of CO2 fixation performed by these organisms. Research approaches will include novel culturing techniques, gene-sequencing, and integrated lipid biomarker and stable isotope analyses. Short-term kinetic analysis will also be performed using 14C-labeled CO2 or HCO3 for activity measurements under conditions consistent with the in situ environments. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will integrate studies of diversity, physiology, molecular genetics and biogeochemistry of chemolithoautotrophs, and build a strong link between their diversity and function in carbon metabolism in hot spring environments. Results from this study will enable these researchers to develop ideas and strategies for establishing a future long-term microbial observatory to study total microbial diversity and processes in Nevada hot springs, so that they can be compared to hot springs in other habitats with a different geochemistry, such as those in Yellowstone National Park or the Uzon Caldera in the Kamchatka peninsula. Finally, this project will enhance infrastructure for developing genome-enabled geomicrobiology programs at the University of Georgia's Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, with strong ties to academic departments on main campus. Their collaborative efforts will be directed to train graduate and undergraduate students with interdisciplinary skills for solving complex geomicrobiogical problems in the 21 Century.\r\n",
