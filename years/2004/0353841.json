 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mathematical Association of America (MAA), through its Strengthening Underrepresented Minority Mathematics Achievement (SUMMA) program, will  support the participation of mathematics undergraduates from underrepresented groups in focused and challenging research experiences to increase their interest in advanced degrees and careers in mathematics. Our goal is to support a minimum of four students at each of four local sites annually, each site to run for six weeks in the summer. The project will be conducted for two years starting in 2004.\r\n\r\nThe MAA SUMMA program seeks to build on a seven-year history of assisting faculty to provide mathematics enrichment projects for pre-college students from underrepresented groups. By offering small-scale programs at geographically diverse locations, we believe that we can broaden the participation in summer research programs by students from underrepresented groups. The MAA and its SUMMA Program, with a focus on undergraduate mathematics, are uniquely positioned to identify and support faculty to direct such programs. Initially, research will be done in these subareas of mathematics: fair division, combinatorial and cooperative game theory, graph theory, mathematical biology, and knot theory.\r\n\r\nThe need for increased participation of U.S. citizens in the mathematical sciences requires that we identify and nurture students from underrepresented groups, both to serve as professional mathematicians and to serve as role models and mentors for future generations. With support of faculty mentors and the focused peer-group experience shared by students participating in this program, the MAA National Research Experience for Undergraduates Program will encourage and support broadened participation of these students in graduate studies and careers in mathematics. Moreover, by supporting faculty at a diverse group of institutions to direct summer research programs, we are simultaneously supporting the development of a community of skilled faculty mentors which we expect will lead to ever-increasing opportunities for undergraduate research. The 48 participants will significantly increase the pool of minority graduate students.\r\n\r\nProgram Contacts:\r\nWilliam Hawkins, MAA SUMMA\tMichael Pearson, MAA Programs and Services\t\r\nbhawkins@maa.org\t\t\tpearson@maa.org\t\r\n\r\nMathematical Association of America\t\tPh: 202-387-5200\r\n1529 Eighteenth St NW, Washington DC 20036\r\n\r\nRobert Megginson, MSRI\r\nmeggin@msri.org\r\n\r\nMathematical Sciences Research Institute\t\tPh: 510-642-0143\r\n1000 Centennial Drive, Berkeley, CA 94720-5070\r\n",
