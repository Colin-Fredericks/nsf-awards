 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flag varieties form an important class of varieties in Algebraic\r\nGeometry. Schubert varieties form an important class of subvarieties inside\r\nflag varieties. The principal investigator developed a ``Standard Monomial\r\nTheory\" (henceforth abbreviated SMT) in collaboration with Musili and\r\nSeshadri for flag varieties and their Schubert varieties. This theory has\r\nled to very many important geometric & representation-theoretic\r\nconsequences.  The principal investigator's recent research shows that once\r\nthere is a good SMT for an algebraic variety, much information could be\r\ninferred about the variety (using SMT); for instance, SMT throws light on\r\nthe degenerations of the variety. The degenerations of a variety in turn\r\nfacilitate the understanding of the geometric aspects of the variety. This\r\ntechnique has been used very recently in the area of Complexity Theory in\r\nComputer Science, esp., in the context of the ``P not equal to\r\nNP-conjecture\". There is yet another interesting and important class of\r\nalgebraic varieties related to Flag varieties, namely,  the class of  orbit\r\nclosures for the Adjoint action of a semi-simple algebraic group on the\r\nvariety of nilpotent elements in its Lie algebra. While there are very many\r\ninteresting algebraic varieties - the determinantal varieties, Ladder\r\ndeterminantal varieties, quiver varieties - which get identified in a\r\nnatural way with certain open subsets in Schubert varieties, the\r\nabove-mentioned orbit closures (and more generally orbit closures arising\r\nfrom cyclic quivers) get identified in a natural way with certain open\r\nsubsets in affine Schubert varieties, i.e., Schubert varieties in the\r\ngeneralized flag variety associated to a Kac-Moody algebra. The research\r\nproject considered in this proposal aims at developing a SMT for the\r\nabove-mentioned orbit closures via the fore-said relationship with Schubert\r\nvarieties ; it also aims at developing a SMT for other interesting classes\r\nof varieties - large Schubert varieties, Spherical varieties etc., as well\r\nas determining in an explicit way the multiplicative structure of the\r\nequivariant Grothendieck ring and the equivariant cohomology ring of flag\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nModern Algebraic Geometry (developed in the later half of the 20-th century)\r\nhas proved itself (beyond any doubts) to be indispensable in various\r\ndisciplines within Mathematics as well as in other areas outside\r\nMathematics:\r\nExamples: Topology, Representation Theory, Combinatorics (within\r\nMathematics).\r\nThe modern Quantum Theory (especially Quantum & Conformal field theories) in\r\nPhysics.\r\nRobotics, Complexity Theory, Computer vision in Computer Science.\r\nThis proposal is at the cross-roads of  Commutative Algebra, Algebraic\r\nGeometry, Combinatorics & Representation-theory. The varieties studied in\r\nthis proposal form an important class of varieties in Algebraic Geometry;\r\nfor example, the theory of Schubert varieties (over finite fields) is\r\nclosely linked to Coding theory.  The principal investigator believes that\r\nthis proposal is bound to have significant impacts on the above-mentioned\r\ndisciplines.\r\n",
