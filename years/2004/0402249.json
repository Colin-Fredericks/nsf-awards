 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under this award the PIs will use fossil corals from the western Solomon Islands and eastern Papua New Guinea to reconstruct high-resolution Holocene/ Deglacial  paleoclimate  records.  The study area is located near the heart of the Western Pacific Warm Pool  (WPWP),  a  region  that  serves  as  the  heat  engine  of  the  planetary  climate  system  and  a primary source of water vapor to the atmosphere.  Studies of the instrumental record show that variations in the thermal and hydrologic properties of the WPWP have global ocean and atmospheric ramifications.  This project would generate  monthly  resolved,  multidecadal  to century-scale  proxy  records  of  thermal  and  hydrologic  variability  in  the  WPWP  via  paired isotopic (?18O) and elemental ratio (Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca, U/Ca) determinations in fossil corals.  These geochemical determinations will be made after the fossil coral samples have been evaluated for potential diagenetic alteration using petrography and mineralogy criteria and after they have been precisely dated by TIMS U-series analysis.  The coral proxy climate records will be used to 1) identify  and  define  the  timing  and  magnitude  of  abrupt  transitions  and  extremes  in Holocene/Deglacial climate in the WPWP and determine how abrupt changes in the tropics are related to previously defined intervals of abrupt change in the  extra-tropics;  and  2)  determine how  changes  in  the  mean  climate  state  of  the  WPWP  tropical  region  influence  the  nature  of tropical climate variability on interannual to centennial timescales during the Holocene.",
