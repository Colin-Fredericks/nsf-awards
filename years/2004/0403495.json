An common example is muscle tissue, which converts  chemical energy into biological movement. In this research project,  materials will be studied that convert either electrical energy or light  energy into a bending motion. Such devices may have application in areas  such as sensors or switches and can be adapted to the micro- or nanoscale.\r\n\r\nThe electrical actuators are made from nafion sandwiched between layers  of carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotube layers act as electrodes for  electrical input. When current is supplied, the composite bends towards  the positive electrode or can be made to oscillate if an alternating  current is used. The research activities will be aimed at understanding  the mechanism of this behavior so that an optimal structure can be devised and tested. In contrast, the light driven actuator is composed of only two layers: nafion and carbon nanotubes. When light is shined on  this bilayer, the composite bends toward the nafion layer, independent  of the orientation of the light source. Such a mode of action is unprecedented. The research will be designed to begin to understand the \r\nunderlying source for this physical behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
