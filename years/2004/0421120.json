 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for acquisition of a sophisticated confocal-like microscopy system consisting of a inverted fluorescence microscope interfaced with an imaging system that employs a moving grid of illumation that allows identification and rejection of out-of-focus light.  This permits optical sectioning and the assembly of 3-D reconstructions of imaged specimens. Environmental control hardware will permit the imaging of live cells.  The system will be placed in an image analysis core facility, in close proximity to faculty research laboratories and undergraduate teaching laboratories.  The system will be used for research in the following areas:  the role in neuronal differentiation of the Diaphanous-related Formins, a family of Rho GTPase target proteins; the mechanism and regulation of intracellular transport of the multifunctional protein galectin-3; the role of eukaryotic cytokines on growth and structure of bacterial biofilms; the regulation of CD44 receptor expression and trafficking by hyaluronic acid; the cellular localization and functions of a novel cysteine protease in soybean; and 6) the analysis of tissue-specific protein expression in duct cells of the lacrimal gland. In addition to these research uses, the instrument will enhance research training of undergraduate students and will have a prominent role in research design and methods courses whose topics vary depending on the expertise and interest of the teaching faculty. Investigative use of the system will be introduced in various other coursesin the form of training exercises and independent student investigations. Users will include summer research students, students enrolled in upper-division courses, and faculty.",
