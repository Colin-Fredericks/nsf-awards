 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal aims to address some of the most fundamental and challenging issues in the field of nonlinear\r\ncontrol. The main objectives are to develop nonsmooth feedback design approaches achieving global stabilization,\r\nadaptive regulation and output tracking, via measurable signals, for a significant class of nonlinear systems with\r\nunstabilizable/undetectable linearization, which cannot be dealt with by any smooth feedback, even locally. Nonsmooth\r\nfeedback designs ofer the potential to overcome certain topological obstacles that cannot be addressed by smooth\r\ncontrols, for example, to globally stabilize a nonlinear system that is not stabilizable by any linear or smooth state\r\nfeedback, because the linearized system has uncontrollable modes associated with eigenvalues on the right-half plane.\r\nThe basic research components of this proposal are to design nonsmooth partial state or output feedback controllers\r\nthat achieve global strong stability and do so in a robust fashion, that is, in a manner which is not sensitive to\r\nperturbations and parametric uncertainties in the system.\r\nThe other focal points of this proposal will be the development of a new output tracking theory for inherently\r\nnonlinear systems by measurement feedback. The objective is to make the controlled plant track a desired reference\r\nsignal. A key feature of the classical servomechanism theory is the ability to absorb the effect of modeling errors and\r\nto secure asymptotic tracking in the presence of uncertainties. A nonlinear analogue of these robustness properties was\r\ndeveloped via center manifold theory, under the assumption that the linearized system is controllable and observable,\r\nat least partially. However, little result is known on the output regulation of nonlinear systems whose linearization\r\nis unobservable and uncontrollable. Our preliminary analysis suggests that a new formulation to the nonlinear reg-\r\nulator problem is needed. Indeed, some dramatic examples in the proposal indicate that while asymptotic output\r\ntracking is usually not possible, even locally, practical output tracking is achievable. One of important components\r\nof this project will be to establish a general theory for global practical output tracking of nonlinear systems with\r\nuncontrollable/unobservable linearization, in the presence of nonlinear parameterization.\r\nThe theoretical research will be complemented by several novel applications. In particular, the nonsmooth control\r\ntheory to be developed will be used to address diffcult control problems including output feedback stabilization of\r\nunderactuated mechanical systems and output tracking/regulation of antagonistic biomimetic actuation systems, by\r\nnonsmooth measurement feedback.\r\nIntellectual Merits: This program will not only provided a general framework for the control of nonlinear systems\r\nwith uncontrollable/unobservable linearization by nonsmooth measurement feedback, but also make a fundamental\r\ncontribution to a number of important and challenging open problems such as output feedback stabilization, output\r\ntracking and regulation, for genuinely nonlinear systems that cannot be controlled by existing smooth synthesis tech-\r\nniques. The proposed research will yield new insight, advance the state-of-the-art of nonsmooth control theory, and\r\nfurther facilitate the development of nonsmooth design methods and their applications for a large class of inherently\r\nnonlinear systems.\r\nBroader Impact: The proposed research will have enormous impact on developing a new generation of nonlinear\r\ncontrol technologies, with emphasis on the development of computationally efficient and practically feasible nonsmooth\r\ncontrol tools and algorithms, for critical biomedical control applications and for achieving high-performance operation\r\nof engineering systems (e.g. mobile robots, underactuated mechanical systems, and biomimetic or biologically-inspired\r\nsystems). Applications of the nonsmooth control methods to biomimetic systems have the potential to overcome some\r\nfundamental diffculties in designing biologically-inspired robots (e.g. cockroach-like hexapod robots), functional elec-\r\ntrical stimulation muscles, and other man-made devices whose embedded control systems can function autonomously\r\nin the real world, thus improving significantly performance of the first generation biomimetic systems. The outcomes\r\nof this program are envisioned to provide new avenues for a significant improvement of operability and efficiency\r\nof engineering and biologically-inspired systems, to create commercial or biomedical application opportunities, and\r\neventually to result in economic benefits.\r\n1",
