 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, evaluating protocols for wireless networks and developing scaling techniques for physical environments, aims at deploying an anechoic chamber for interference control, forming a testbed, referred to as the Wireless Wind Tunnel. The uses of the testbed focus on:\r\n\tEvaluation of wireless protocols (WP) in controlled environments,\r\n\tDevelopment of channel models suitable for simulation-based evaluation of WPs, and\r\n\tEvaluation of techniques for scaling the physical environment to facilitate realistic wireless experiments.\r\nThe Wireless Wind Tunnel (WWT) addresses some of the limitations based on computer evaluations resulting from the present insufficient understanding of channel and system models for wireless networks. These are not well understood and brute force accurate simulation of the wireless environment are at present too complex. Existing hardware testbeds suffer from one or both of the following shortcomings: \r\n\tExperiments often cannot be repeated due to interference by other wireless devices operating in the same frequency range and \r\n\tThe parameters of the experiment (such as the mobility patterns of the mobiles and scatterers in the environment) are not fully controllable.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  This work impacts the education mission, including course work, laboratories, student projects. The testbed will serve as a demonstration tool. New educational opportunities will open involving experimental research providing better training and motivation. Facilities will be made available to a larger pool of researchers. Additional impact is expected on communications systems in practice.\r\n",
