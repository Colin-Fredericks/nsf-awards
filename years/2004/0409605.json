 "awd_abstract_narration": "0409605\r\nReches\r\n\r\nThis is a project to investigate seismogenic processes at the focal-depth of earthquakes.  This will be conducted in the deep gold mines of South Africa that offer unique advantages:  (1)  Mining operations control the location, magnitude and timing of the earthquakes and the investigation can be focused at sites where earthquakes are guaranteed; (2)  The mine infrastructure allows access to earthquake-producing faults and permits monitoring fault activity before, during and after earthquakes at distances of 1-100 m from the hypocenter;  (3)  The size of mine earthquakes (M = 3-4) bridges the gap between the small samples used in the laboratory (M<0) and large earthquakes along crustal faults (M>6); and (4)  The effects of catastrophic earthquakes on subsurface life (microbial ecology) could be monitored.  The South African mines are, in essence, a natural earthquake laboratory with opportunities to make fundamental contributions to earthquake science by near-field, three-dimensional monitoring of the earthquake process.  There is no other natural environment where this is possible.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project will involve:  (1)  Drilling through three active fault zones at depths of 1.5 - 3.0 km in mines.  The faults will be chosen to optimize the structure and seismic activity for research; i.e. they will have a high probability of generating small to moderate earthquakes during the life of the project;  (2)  A dense array of instruments will be deployed to monitor the three-dimensional, nearfield processes of the earthquakes.  The instruments will include seismometers, strainmeters, temperature sensors, displacement-meters, and devices to monitor strong-ground motion, electromagnetic radiation, acoustic emission, and time-variations of microbial communities and fault fluid and gas chemistry; and (3)  The physical and chemical conditions of the active faults will be characterized by in-situ stress measurements and 3D mapping, and by extensive chemical and rock mechanics\r\n",
