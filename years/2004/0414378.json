The work, which is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses metallic thin film growth and spatial organization of thin films.  The effect of surfactants on heteroepitaxial growth, thin film growth on bimetallic and quasicrystalline substrates, and the ordering of chemisorbed layers on metal substrates are all addressed in this research project.  Experimental information from scanning probe microscopy and high resolution electron diffraction is combined with theoretical modeling of the growth process and calculations of geometric structures and relaxation of thin film morphologies.  Information from this fundamental work helps to understand electronic materials processing and nanomaterials synthesis and preparation. \r\n\r\nIn order to understand the growth processes that form the basis of many important technologies, including electronic device preparation, catalysis formation, and nanomaterials synthesis, fundamental information about the growth and morphological changes of model systems must be obtained.  This research collaboration between Evans and Thiel at Iowa State University provides detailed experimental information about the growth process with state of the art modeling of the growth and relaxation processes.  With the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, this collaboration is examining the effects of surfactants, bimetallic and quasicrystal systems, and ordered chemisorbed overlayers using these approaches. \r\n",
