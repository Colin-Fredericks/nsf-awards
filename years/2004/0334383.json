 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will study the photo-chemistry and neutral-plasma coupling of\r\nEarth and Mars.  The approach is to compare the ionospheres of Earth and Mars using data and theory in order to better understand the basic physical processes that are common to both.  The objectives are to (1) test the predictions of simple photochemical equilibrium models for how peak electron densities in the ionospheres of Earth and Mars vary with solar flux, distance from the Sun, and solar zenith angle using standard terrestrial observations and Martian observations from the radio science experiment on the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft; (2) study the effects of solar flares and coronal mass ejections on simultaneous observations of the terrestrial and Martian ionospheres to understand how Space Weather impacts these different environments; (3) examine the effects of waves and tides in the neutral atmosphere of Mars on the ionosphere, and then compare to predictions from models developed for Earth for ionosphere-neutral atmosphere coupling.  Areas of weakness and potential improvement in the models will be identified.  The research will improve understanding of ionospheric processes by testing predictions derived from terrestrial experience on simultaneous observations of the ionospheres of Earth and Mars.  The coordination of terrestrial and Martian observations is a creative and original concept that will build links between the disciplines of planetary and terrestrial aeronomy.  By studying the effects of solar changes on more than one planet, any shortfalls in models for how the terrestrial ionosphere responds to the Sun will be identified and areas for potential improvement highlighted.  This will facilitate the separation of solar and anthropogenic impacts on the terrestrial atmosphere, a goal of the Global Change Program.  Simultaneous studies of the effects of space weather on more than one planet will similarly benefit the National Space Weather Program.  Since the physics governing ionospheric processes should be the same on Earth and beyond Earth, models based on terrestrial observations should be valid beyond Earth's ionosphere.  These models will be tested, especially in the areas of solar variability and the effects of magnetic fields, by comparing solar-terrestrial interactions on Earth and Mars.  Studies of waves and tides will address how ionospheres couple with lower altitudes and test if waves and tides are as important in coupling different atmospheric regions on Mars as they are on Earth.",
