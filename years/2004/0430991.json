 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies in Computational Complexity Theory: Project Summary\r\nComputational complexity theory focuses on understanding capabilities of resource bounded computations.\r\nComputations are broadly classi.ed as uniform computations (Turing machine based)\r\nand non-uniform computations (circuit based). Typical resources studied are time steps and memory\r\nspace for uniform computations, and circuit size and depth for non-uniform computations. By\r\nlimiting various resource requirements of computations to certain robust bounds we get complexity\r\nclasses, which are the fundamental objects of study in complexity theory. Research in complexity\r\ntheory broadly centers around two themes (1) proving relations, in the form of inclusions and separations,\r\namong various complexity classes (2) quantifying the di.culty/easiness of solving real-life\r\ncomputational problems using a computer. These two themes are interconnected by the notions\r\nof completeness and reductions. The overall goal of this proposal is to advance computational\r\ncomplexity theory along these two themes. The overall goal will be accomplished through three\r\nrelated objectives:\r\nObjective 1: Investigate interrelations among uniformity, nonuniformity, and derandomization.\r\nThe PI will investigate a number of issues in uniform vs non-uniform computations and\r\ntheir relation to derandomization. Speci.cally, the PI will investigate uniform derandomization\r\nof Arthur-Merlin games, some related non-uniformity questions including uniform upper\r\nbounds for languages with high circuit complexity, and certain cover-based approach to resource\r\nbounded measure with applications to lower complexity classes and derandomization.\r\nObjective 2: Investigate computational problems with intermediate complexity. The PI will\r\ncontinue his investigation of problems that are intermediate between P and NP-complete such\r\nas Graph Isomorphism problem and some computational group-theoretic problems. A number\r\nof questions related to lowness properties of these problems will be investigated. E.cient\r\nprogram checkers for a host of computational group-theoretic problems will be designed.\r\nObjective 3: Explore the interconnections between complexity theory and computational\r\nlearning theory. The PI will explore interconnections between complexity theory and learning\r\ntheory. In particular, the PI will investigate learning problems such as learning DNFs and\r\nBoolean Circuits in the Teaching Assistant model, and the applications of learning algorithms\r\nto complexity theory.\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed research activity will have several broader impacts. Complexity\r\ntheory indirectly impacts many areas of computer science. Thus proposed research has potential to\r\nscienti.cally impact these areas. Research results from this grant will be published in peer-reviewed\r\njournals and will be presented in international conferences, thus enabling broad dissemination of the\r\nthe results to enhance scienti.c understanding. New courses will be created and taught along the\r\ntheme of this project, thus integrating teaching and research. The grant will also be used for various\r\nhuman resource development activities such as supporting and mentoring graduate students, and\r\ninviting visitors.\r\nIntellectual Merit: Progress made in complexity theory is essential for furthering the knowledge\r\nof what can and cannot be solved by a computer using reasonable amount of resources. The results\r\nfrom this proposal will extend our knowledge of complexity theory in several directions. Research\r\nin derandomization and non-uniformity will solve some signi.cant open problems in the area and\r\nwill contribute to better understand the role of randomness in computation. Part of the proposed\r\nresearch directly relates to important real-life problems such as Graph Isomorphism problem and\r\nDNF learning problem and has potential to become practically applicable. The research on program\r\ncheckers is expected to have some practical applications.",
