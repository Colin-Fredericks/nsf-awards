 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) We are integrating early undergraduate, interdisciplinary student research into our first semester general chemistry lab and introductory geology courses.  This research centers on the study of environmental problems/concerns in our area.  We are using ion chromatography and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to study both general drinking water quality and lead contamination of soil, the latter being a documented and serious problem in the city of Omaha.  The project is vertically integrated into the department so that students in the upper division chemistry courses have an ongoing role in developing new research questions and projects for use in the introductory courses.  In addition to improving the quality of the upper division laboratory experience, this serves to promote significant student mentoring interactions within the department.      \r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to: 1) improve the crucial first impressions that students form about science at this level; 2) increase the number of chemistry and geology majors; 3) increase student independence, responsibility, and self-motivation; 4) increase retention of students in\r\nintroductory chemistry and geology courses; and 5) increase the quantity and curricular relevance of science studied by pre-service teachers.\r\n",
