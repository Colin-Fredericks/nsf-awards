 "awd_abstract_narration": "0401397\r\nYariv\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses theoretical and experimental investigation of a completely\r\nnew type of optical resonators.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit:\r\n\r\nThe resonator belongs to the class of \"Defect\" resonators in periodic photonic bandgap structures [13, 14, 17]. The \"defect\" consists of a controlled departure from the ideal index distribution of a cylindrical Bragg waveguide [3, 4]. The main advantage of such resonator is the fact that the (annular) defect, and therefore the light confinement, can be placed at will at any radial position and not necessarily at the core or the periphery (like whispering gallery resonators).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the dependence of the modal characteristics on the transverse periodicity (or quasi periodicity) offers a new and major control of the free spectral range which can be increased by, possibly, an order of magnitude. Moreover, by placing the defect, where the light is concentrated, away from the outer boundary, where inevitable scattering due to surface imperfections take place, the new resonator promises to posses, potentially, much higher Q-factor than is possible with the conventional dielectric counterparts. In addition, the interaction of the electrical field with the surrounding medium can be enhanced significantly by the ability to confine the field in an air defect. This is important for applications including optical communication, spectroscopy, detection of chemical and biological agents, quantum communication and encryption which depend on a strong atom (molecule) - light interaction.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact:\r\n\r\nThe Caltech educational environment supports and encourages collaborative work and interaction between experienced researchers (senior graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, faculty) and inexperienced researchers. Programs such as the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) and the Minority Undergraduate Research Fellowship (MURF) enables a diverse group of students, both from within and outside Caltech, to get involved in cutting-edge scientific research under the guidance of faculty and senior researchers. The strong collaborations of their group with industry partners and government laboratories will expose the student to real-world problems and enhance the dissemination of new ideas and technology.  Periodically, results from this work will be presented in a research seminar open to all Caltech students who wish to attend, ensuring knowledge transfer to the community.\r\n",
