 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will identify gene products that function in the free-living roundworm C. elegans germline development which are phosphorylation targets of MPK-1 ERK MAP Kinase.  ERK MAP kinases act at the end of numerous extracellular signaling cascades, such as receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, which have essential functions in animal development and homeostasis.  In many cases, the downstream target proteins that are activated or inactivated when phosphorylated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) are unknown.  In the model experimental organism C. elegans, there is a single gene similar to ERK (ERK ortholog) and is known as MPK-1. This functions in ten different germline processes and the target proteins that are phosphorylated by MPK-1 ERK to mediate these germline processes are unknown.  In this project, a three-part approach will be used to identify MPK-1 ERK phosphorylation targets that function in germline development.  In the first part, docking site sequences will be used to computationally identify C. elegans proteins that are potential targets of MPK-1 ERK phosphorylation.  In the second part, in vivo validation of the predicted target gene products will be performed by RNA mediated interference of the corresponding genes in genetic backgrounds that are sensitized for MPK-1 ERK signaling.  In the third part, selected in vivo validated targets will be confirmed as targets by in vitro phosphorylation using purified mammalian ERK.  The Broader Impact of this project is at three levels: First, the project will provide research training in genetics, genomics and developmental biology for a postdoctoral fellow and a number of undergraduate students.  Second, novel genes that mediate ten different aspects of germline development that are directly regulated by ERK will be identified.  Third, given the conservation of both ERK signaling and germline development, it is very likely that the ERK targets identified in C. elegans will also be ERK targets in other animals.   \r\n",
