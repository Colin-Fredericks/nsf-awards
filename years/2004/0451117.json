 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide travel support for approximately twenty graduate students to attend the First Annual International Conference on Security for Mobile, Wireless and Ubiquitous Systems (MoWiSec) jointly supported by the European Commission (EC) and NSF. This new conference will provide a forum to exchange ideas, techniques, and applications, discuss best practices and future directions, raise awareness and share experiences among researchers, practitioners, standard developers and policy makers in the field of security for wireless/mobile networking based systems including pervasive and ubiquitous systems. The conference will provide for interactive and fruitful discussions on the various topics among participants from the academic, governmental, and industrial sectors. The travel award will target graduate students, since attending conferences is an important part of their educational experience, and they often have limited funds. This travel support thus contributes to initiate, develop, and foster relationships with leading international groups undertaking research in the related technical areas. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
