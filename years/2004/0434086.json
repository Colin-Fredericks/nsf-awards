 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Cincinnati Robert Noyce Scholarship Initiative to Increase Math/Science Teachers in Urban Schools is recruiting, encouraging and supporting talented science, technology, engineering, and mathematics majors and professionals to become K-12 mathematics or science teachers in a high-need urban school district.  The University of Cincinnati/Cincinnati Public Schools (UC/CPS) Initiative provides two avenues for developing teachers: one for recent college graduates and mid-career professionals transitioning into teaching careers in science or math; and another for students with interests in math or science enrolling in the Cincinnati Initiative for Teacher Education and studying to become teachers. Twenty students are being recruited and supported annually throughout the program.  In collaboration with Arts & Sciences and the College of Engineering, candidates are being recruited from among displaced corporate employees, active community members, and minority students at Cincinnati State Technical and Community College and the regional Historically Black Colleges and Universities (Wilberforce and Central State Universities).  Participants are benefiting professionally through interaction with UC and CPS faculty, mentors, and evaluation specialists in a partnership that is linking research, theory and practice to develop strong teachers who are effective in urban settings. This initiative, grounded in strong community connections, is implementing innovative practices tailored to produce teachers who can reach urban youth.",
