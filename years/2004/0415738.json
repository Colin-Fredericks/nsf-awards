Initial attempts to quantify parameter uncertainties will use Bayesian Stochastic  Inversion  based  on  Multiple  Very  Fast  Simulated  Annealing  (Multiple  VFSA),  a stochastic  importance  sampling technique developed and successfully applied to the interpretation  of  geophysical  data.  In parallel, stochastic sampling strategies will be reviewed  from  a  Monte-Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) perspective to advance this theory's applicability to problems that are currently  limited  by  the  number  of  samples  that may  be  feasible  to  consider  either  because  of computational  cost  (e.g.  climate models)  or  the  size  of  data  sets  (e.g.  interpretations  of geophysical  data).  Specific objectives include 1) estimating a multidimensional probability \r\ndistribution for a set of parameters related to clouds, convection, and radiation within the latest version of CAM2 (the climate model developed at NCAR) that are significant sources of climate model prediction uncertainty, 2) evaluate sampling biases within Multiple VFSA and prototype new  efficient  and  robust  methods  of  statistical inference from a MCMC perspective, 3) the calculation of an ensemble of doubled CO2 experiments with a coupled atmosphere-mixed layer ocean  model that is representative of the combined uncertainty in these parameters, and 4) evaluate the climate processes that explain differences in model  response  to  changes  in  CO2 forcing.   \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  Quantifying the main sources of climate model uncertainty  is  the first step toward reducing differences between different models forced by the same inputs. There is potentially useful data from both the instrumental record as well as paleoclimate archives that have not been fully exploited. The proposed research provides a methodological foundation for using these data sources to address these objectives. The results from the proposed research will demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of exploring atmospheric GCM parameter space in a comprehensive and systematic manner. With current inexpensive but powerful distributed computing architectures and the ability to automatically navigate parameter space, parameter choices can be more easily optimized for model performance.  The proposed research activity will also contribute to the training and support of two graduate students.   \r\n\r\n",
