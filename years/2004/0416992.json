 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) in Information Assurance Education, Carnegie Mellon received NSF funding to develop and offer an intensive, month-long, in-residence summer program to help develop Information Assurance Capacity Building Program (IACBP) at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs).  The first offerings were highly successful and made a substantial contribution to the capacity of the partnering Minority Serving Institutions to educate students in the critical field of IA. The response from participating MSI faculty members and from their respective department heads was uniformly and extremely positive, and numerous new IA courses, modules, and plans for degree programs have been produced. In this project, Carnegie Mellon builds upon this program and the partnerships developed through it, and to expand the program to more partnering minority serving institutions. This project funds the next two offerings (summer of 2004 and summer of 2005) of the IACBP, with participation by a total of twenty-four additional faculty members from selected MSIs.",
