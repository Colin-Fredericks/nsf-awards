 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides additional CSEM educational opportunities for students to help meet the demand for scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technicians in order to contribute to the growth of the economy of Mississippi, the surrounding region and the nation. Encouraging students to pursue degrees in CSEM and providing financial support to CSEM majors are two of the major goals of the program. \r\n\r\nObjectives of the project include: 1) to increase participation of academically-talented low income students in CSEM; 2) to increase participation of underrepresented groups in CSEM; 3) to better prepare students for the workforce by enriching the educational experience of CSEM students through connections of academic content to the work environment; 4) to increase awareness of STEM employment opportunities through existing and new industry partnerships; 5) to strengthen existing industry partnerships by creating linkages between students and potential employers; 6) to increase enrollment of academically-gifted students from community colleges in CSEM at Mississippi State University; 7) to encourage scholarship recipients to pursue advanced degrees in CSEM.   \r\n\r\nThirty CSEM Undergraduate and Graduate Fellows are selected from applicants recruited from state and regional high schools and community colleges, Historically Black Institutions, and four-year institutions using connections established during an earlier successful CSEMS project.  The number of applicants from each academic program and level determine the allocation of the 30 scholarships. The majority of the scholarships are awarded to undergraduates, with some graduate student awards made to those who provide evidence of economic hardship. \r\n\r\nThe eight operating departments and two centers in the Bagley College of Engineering and the Department of Mathematics and Statistics in the College of Arts and Sciences participate in the program. Each participating department has a representative to the CSEM program who plays a lead role in coordinating activities and assigning mentors within the department. Fellows are mentored one-on-one by faculty and by their peers. They participate in research and design projects, present results of their research professionally, and interact with industry. MSU's Cooperative Education and Career Services offices aid Fellows in career placement.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project fosters industry/academic relationships that help enhance the future technological competence of the workforce in the state of Mississippi and surrounding region. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The broader impact of this project is to increase the numbers of underrepresented students with the skills necessary to be successful in CSEM areas upon graduation. The success of these students directly impacts the workforce in the state of Mississippi as well as provides role models for future generations. \r\n",
