 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the pathway of protein import into the chloroplast.  The chloroplast is the site of photosynthesis and houses an array of biosynthetic pathways needed for plant growth and development.  A novel genetic screen using Arabidopsis thaliana will be initiated to broaden an understanding of what determines the regulation and specificity of protein import.  The study will:  1) Identify mutant plants that show a loss of herbicide tolerance, resulting in an herbicide sensitive phenotype, providing an initial indication of an import defect.  Herbicide tolerance can be conferred by a special EPSP synthase, a key enzyme required for synthesis of essential aromatic amino acids in the chloroplast.  The precursor of EPSP synthase is normally imported from the cytosol.  An herbicide sensitive phenotype will indicate that a mutation in the import pathway has prevented the correct localization and function of the enzyme.  2) Identify the location of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the same transgenic plants that exhibit an herbicide sensitive phenotype.  Localization of GFP fused to a chloroplast targeting signal will establish if the mutants identified in the herbicide screen are defective in an import step.  3) Characterize the mutant plants at the genetic and phenotypic levels.  Comprehensive morphological, cellular and molecular analyses of the mutant phenotypes will be carried out. 4) Identify the gene responsible for the mutant phenotype through genetic mapping experiments.  Given the central role of the chloroplast, elucidating how it is assembled and functions is a goal of fundamental importance.  This project will provide research training for post-doctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduates.",
