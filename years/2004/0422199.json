 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project of scholarship support and student services that increases the number of low-income computer science, engineering and mathematics undergraduate majors who complete their baccalaureate degrees at Colorado State and prepares them to make a smooth transition into the workforce or graduate school. Colorado State coordinates its existing science and engineering student services resources and its resources in the industrial sector in Northern Colorado creating a comprehensive program to support scholarship recipients. This project assists industries and current initiatives such as\r\n29 CO-AMP, McNair, Women and Minorities in Engineering Program and AGEP project to recruit and enroll underrepresented and low-income students including women and persons with disabilities in CSEM fields. This project not only impacts the lives of scholarship recipients and strengthens Colorado State's ability to train its students, it also demonstrates that students from low-income populations, given appropriate support, can help to meet the critical need for well-prepared technology workers in the U.S. \r\n",
