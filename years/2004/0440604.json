The workshop will focus on scientific areas that present an opportunity for new and continued theoretical and computational research using a wide range of tools and approaches.  The workshop will highlight areas identified by the materials theory community as having high potential for significant progress and impact.  The topical areas will cover the breadth of materials theory including condensed matter theory, theoretical materials science and theoretical solid-state chemistry.  A session on NSF funding opportunities and proposal writing and evaluation will also be held.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the workshop is on young investigators and travel stipends will be provided to assist pre-tenure faculty and postdoctoral associates in attending.  As part of the workshop, there will be a public lecture at Georgetown University to convey to the general public the excitement in this field.\r\n%%%\r\nThis grant supports the fourth biannual Workshop on Opportunities in Materials Theory to be held on October 25-27, 2004, at the National Science Foundation in Arlington, VA, and at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.
