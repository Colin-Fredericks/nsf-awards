 "awd_abstract_narration": "0437920\r\nChen\r\n\r\nFuture optic networks for information technology and defense require signal switching at each network node not only at the fiber level, but also as a function of wavelength. A new class of wavelength selective NxN switches based on micro-ring resonators and electro-optic polymers is proposed to address these challenges. The objective of the proposed research is to demonstrate a new class of fast and compact wavelength selective switches that bring the performance and integration to the next level. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The compact size enables large-scale integration and a large switch array for a given chip size.  More importantly, their small size matches IC chip size and makes fast NxN optical switches integratable on silicon CMOS chips for the first time. In addition, adding the wavelength selectivity to NxN switch arrays opens up another dimension of optical switching and may revolutionize optical component technology. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The new switches may enable high bandwidth data routing, network management, system failure protection and recovery. The technology may also enable robust, reliable and secured network operation, which is vital to the nation's communication system, advancing the security of the critical national infrastructures that support both general public and defense. The outcome of the research can produce valuable intellectual property that contributes to the technological leadership of the nation.  In addition, the project creates research opportunities and financial support for graduate and undergraduate students, and cultivates the interest of students of different levels and of diverse ethnic backgrounds in science and engineering career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
