 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. James Phillips of University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire (UWEC) will conduct experimental and theoretical research on the spectroscopy of donor-acceptor complexes produced in low-temperature, inert matrices (matrix isolation spectroscopy).  The details of the experimental spectra, combined with theoretical studies, will be used to gain an understanding of the bonding in these complexes, and the subtle influences that the matrix has on the bonding.\r\n\r\nThis research project will make a positive impact on the science program of UWEC in that the research program is geared towards studying significant scientific problems and is carried out entirely by undergraduate students.  The work will expose UWEC students to modern spectroscopic and theoretical techniques.  Prof. Phillips has also developed collaborations with industrial and research university colleagues that help to enrich the experiences for UWEC students.  Additionally, the majority of the students at UWEC are female and roughly half are low-income/first generation college students - groups that are historically underrepresented in the sciences, and roughly half of UWEC's students matriculate to PhD programs.",
