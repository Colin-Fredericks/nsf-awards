 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Minorities Striving and Pursuing Higher Degrees of Success (MS PHDS) in Earth System Science Initiative was developed for and by underrepresented minorities (African American, Hispanic and Native Americans, hereafter referred to as minorities) to address critical gaps in preparation, representation, and full participation of minorities in Earth system science. Utilizing insight gained while conducting the 2003 Ocean Sciences Program (a pilot project) the MS PHDS in Earth System Science Initiative Professional Development Program is designed to provide minority undergraduate and graduate students with valuable long-term mentoring opportunities, as well as multiple exposures to, interaction with, and increased participation in the Earth system science community.\r\n\r\nThe Professional Development Program represents a unique opportunity for the professional community to partner with MS PHDS for the purpose of increasing minority participation in Earth system sciences. In recognition of the potential value of the MS PHDS in Earth System Science Initiative's Professional Development Program activities, the PI's college (University of South Florida College of Marine Science), NASA Headquarters and 5 professional societies have pledged human, physical and financial resources in support of the programmatic activities. The MS PHDS in Earth System Science Initiatives Professional Development Program was crafted utilizing community input, evaluation findings, and insight gained from a relatively small-scale discipline-specific pilot project.\r\n\r\nThe Professional Development Program engages MS PHDS participants in a series of actual and virtual activities designed to promote students' long-term participation in the Earth system sciences. Participants are provided with both broad and in-depth science exposure, mentoring opportunities and professional development activities that equip them in making informed post-baccalaureate, academic and professional career decisions. Students will be 1) exposed to leading-edge Earth system science research, 2) given opportunities to interact with scientists responsible for recent research advancements, 3) engage in mentor-mentee partnership activities and 4) receive information regarding current and future Earth system science-related opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe proposed activities address many aspects of NSF's Criterion II, including the advancement of discovery and understanding in the course of promoting training and learning, broadening the participation of underrepresented minorities, enhancing research and education, and the broad dissemination of lessons learned. Outcomes of the Professional Development Program will be disseminated throughout the Earth system science and education community via annual evaluation reports (available on-line), manuscript publications and presentations at professional society meetings.",
