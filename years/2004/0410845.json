The course is being adapted from educational materials developed for graduate students and working engineers by the faculty at a nationally recognized electromagnetic compatibility laboratory at the University of Missouri, Rolla.  In order to allow the students to develop useful and flexible knowledge, the course is exploring the impact that electromagnetic compatibility and signal integrity have on the performance of real systems.  The PIs are creating a learning environment in which students gain conceptual and theoretical understanding as they develop laboratory and measurement techniques.  A review board of nationally-recognized experts in electromagnetic compatibility and educational assessment is helping to assure that the materials developed are of excellent quality, that the assessment plan is well-conceived and fully implemented, and that the materials are disseminated in a form that can be readily adopted by faculty members at other colleges and universities.  The evaluation effort is examining the effects of the course on cognitive skills and affective outcomes using surveys, focus groups, and concept and laboratory inventory tests, which the project team is developing.  The dissemination plan includes publications and presentations in both educational and disciplinary research venues.  The PIs are exploring the inclusion of some of their material in an existing textbook and the publication of a new textbook.\r\n",
