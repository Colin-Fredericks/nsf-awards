 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nHall-effect accelerators (HEA's) are plasma fluid devices that utilize crossed electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields to eject a low-density ionized gas. HEA's are used primarily in two applications: (1) as highly efficient plasma thrusters for spacecraft and, (2) as broad-beam gridless ion sources for material processing. Historically, electron mobility in HEA's has been shown to be 1,000 times greater than predicted by classical plasma theory, yet an explanation for this discrepancy is absent. It is the hypothesis of this project that the widely accepted view of electron motion in an HEA is fundamentally flawed, and that recognition of this flaw may shed light on the mobility anomaly. The PI has undertaken an exhaustive set of fundamental electron fluid dynamics experiments to be conducted in a novel electron-plasma trapping apparatus with the goal of understanding the fluid motion and cross-field mobility in HEA-like field configurations.\r\nThe program is training graduate students for careers as international science leaders through collaboration with Russian and US partners: two graduate students will spend one-month in Moscow performing research with Russian collaborating partner TsNIIMASH, and will spend one-month at the Redmond, WA, research facilities of industry collaborator Aerojet-General Corporation developing an improved HEA device. \r\n\r\nThis project has a high potential for broad impact.  Successful elucidation of the observed anomalous electron mobility in HEAs could have significance in technological areas ranging from materials processing to spacecraft propulsion and in new applications, such as controlled nuclear fusion.  The program also provides a range of educational contributions; it involves graduate students supervising undergraduate students, who in turn supervise high-school students. Placing participants in supervisory roles intrinsically draws them into a deeper understanding of the research, while motivating their in-class studies. This mechanism enables the broadest  participation of educational groups in a hierarchical learning environment and can affect many students. The research proposed will form long-lasting partnerships between collaborators in Russia, US industry, university and high-school staff, and the larger professional community through conferences and dissemination of results at local, national, and international venues.\r\n",
