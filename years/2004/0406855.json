The proposed research program will combine experimental and theoretical modeling activities to fabricate and characterize high quality nanotube/polymer composite membranes.  Recent theoretical work by Sholl has predicted that carbon nanotubes, if used as membranes, have the flux/selectivity properties that far exceed those of any other known inorganic or organic material.  Currently gas separation membranes are fabricated from polymeric materials that are typically processed as hollow fibers. However, despite the ability to produce robust, large-area membranes at relatively low cost, a wider implementation of polymer membranes is hindered by their intrinsic permeability and selectivity limitations. In this exploratory research project the development of novel nano-composite membranes could overcome such limitations. The PIs propose to fabricate and characterize nano-composite membranes, consisting of open-ended carbon nanotubes incorporated in specifically designed polymer matrices. Atomistic and multi-scale modeling of the nano-composite system will provide a fundamental feedback towards understanding and optimization of the transport properties of the nano-composite systems.  The assembled team combines research expertise in molecular modeling, interfacial characterization and nano-composite processing, which will allow the PIs to effectively carry out the activities outlined in the proposal.  In terms of the broader impacts, the research program may lead to the development of robust, highly permeable membranes for selective gas separations, as well as to the introduction of new chemistries and methods, which can be employed in the fabrication of high performance composites, sensors and other chemical devices incorporating carbon nanotubes. The research program has a strong educational component aimed at both graduate and undergraduate students, including unique interdisciplinary and inter-university research experience, inclusion of research examples into the undergraduate curriculum and other educational outreach activities.\r\n",
