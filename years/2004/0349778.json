 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase II research project develops personalized user-interfaces for location-based services. This adaptive proximity-based personalization algorithm recommends nearby venues based on predicted user interest and distance. It will further develop a highly distributed algorithm that allows handsets to perform part of the calculation, dramatically reducing computation costs that central servers would otherwise bear. This context-based user-interface allows users to chain operations, concentrating activities by proximity, and avoiding retyping. This project will expand the user- interface advancements to include personalizing categories, and a user-interface approach that mixes categories with individual venues. In addition it will explore algorithms that mix different types of venues on the same screen. Identity federation will help retailers and portals more readily deal with intermediary services. Self-service retail interfaces can allow traditional \"brick-and-mortar\" retailers to cost-effectively provide \"click-and-mortar\" services to consumers. A SOAP-based web-service will allow portals to filter data and configure look-and-feel more precisely. However, the proposed  <object>  tag mechanism will likely be good enough for most portals, as the output format can be configured easily through CSS, and filtering can be performed through the company's self-service portal interface\r\n\r\nThe end result of this project is a product that can be incorporated in enterprise logistics applications that help field personnel find, reserve, use and store resources while being able to improve the speed that consumers navigate user-interfaces, even when location is irrelevant. The in-handset personalization may ensure better privacy and security, even in non-location based applications. The product will use proximity to maximize value: building business-consumer relationships, enhancing social harmony and strengthening communities, as a result.\r\n",
