 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nLow-Cost Distributed Solar-Thermal-Electric Power Generation\r\n\r\nWe discuss the technical and economic feasibility of a low-cost distributed solar-thermal-electric\r\npower generation technology based on the use of a solar thermal collector (STC)in conjunction with\r\na free-piston Stirling engine.The solar thermal collector is to be comprised of low-concentration\r\nnonimaging concentrators and absorbers with spectrally selective coatings.The Stirling engine\r\nconverts moderate temperature heat to electricity by way of integrated electric generation.In spite\r\nof its relatively low conversion e .ciency,the proposed system can be a cost-e .ective alternative to\r\nsolar photovoltaic (PV)modules,as discussed in the project description.\r\nThe system is conceived to operate with collector temperatures in the range of 125 .C to 150 .C,\r\nwhich is consistent with the use of stationary solar thermal collectors employing low-concentration\r\nnonimaging re .ectors.Thus,the system avoids the costs and maintenance issues associated with\r\ntracking collectors based on high concentration ratio concentrators.\r\nWe take the view that cost e .ectiveness of solar electric technologies should be judged by\r\noutput power per dollar rather than by e .ciency or other technical merits.This view re .ects the\r\nobservation that there are vast untapped siting opportunities in both urban and rural regions of\r\nthe world.Research into photovoltaics has been focused on improving e .ciency because there\r\nhas been no signi .cant decrease in the inherent cost of silicon wafer area.However,the proposed\r\nsolar-thermal-electric system is designed for fabrication out of low-cost materials.A collector is\r\nbuilt of glass,aluminum,copper,and insulation,while engines and generators are primarily steel,\r\naluminum,copper,and plastics.In high-volume manufacturing,the cost of the proposed system\r\nwill be determined by the weight of its bulk materials.This study of solar-thermal-electric systems\r\ninvolves searching for a more cost-e .ective balance between system e .ciency and materials cost.\r\nBroader Impacts Energy independence and diversi .cation through the use of renewable dis-\r\ntributed sources is essential for the future of our society.In the project description,we make a case\r\nthat the proposed technology will cost on the order of $1 per Watt of peak output power.As such,\r\nthis technology would represent at least a .ve-fold improvement over photovoltaic technology in\r\nterms of cost.A simple estimate of energy cost using the proposed technology based on an average\r\nof only four hours per day of operation over a modest ten year lifetime indicates a cost of about\r\n$0.066/kW-hr.Although not equal to the lowest costs for electricity,this is certainly an energy\r\ncost that makes the technology very valuable when considering the additional advantages of its\r\nnature.Namely,this is a distributed renewable energy source with an availability that is fairly well\r\nmatched to peak demand times.Further,this technology is well suited to distributed deployment\r\nin an analogous manner to that of photovoltaic generation.As such,it will be valuable for remote\r\nsites where utility infrastructure is non-existent or too costly as well as for residential and business\r\nsites as an alternative to photovoltaics.\r\nThe PI has been active in integrating research into new and existing classes,and plans to con-\r\ntinue this in conjunction with the proposed work.The PI also actively seeks to include underrep-\r\nresented student groups in his projects.UC Berkeley hosts the SUPERB (Summer Undergraduate\r\nProgram in Engineering Research at Berkeley,http://www.coe.berkeley.edu/cues/superb/index.html)\r\nprogram which targets underrepresented and minority students.The PI plans to actively recruit\r\nin the SUPERB program for students to participate in the proposed project during the summer\r\nperiods.\r\nIntellectual Merit A direct strategy for enabling a renewable energy source by seeking to min-\r\nimize the cost-to-output-power ratio is outlined.We analyze the cost of an integrated system\r\nincluding a solar thermal collector and a low-temperature Stirling engine.Novel multi-phase free-\r\npiston Stirling machine designs are proposed along with rigorous analysis techniques for their design\r\nand evaluation.Speci .cally,a Stirling machine with no mechanical linkages and only three moving\r\nparts is discussed.This is a design that inherently permits for a long maintenance-free lifetime and\r\nfor very low frictional losses.\r\n1",
