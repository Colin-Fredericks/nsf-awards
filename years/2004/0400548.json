An important object of study \r\nwill be support varieties which provide a bridge linking  \r\nthe representation theory, cohomology theory and the structure \r\ntheory (involving conjugacy classes) of Lie algebras. \r\nComputations of such varieties will be considered as well \r\nas generalizations of the theory to quantum groups and affine \r\nLie algebras. The investigator will also look at \r\ncomputations of cohomology groups/rings of finite Chevalley groups\r\nand Frobenius kernels especially for primes less than the Coxeter \r\nnumber. It is anticipated that the use of extensive \r\ncomputer calculations might be necessary for several of these \r\nprojects. \r\n\r\nAlgebraic structures such are groups, rings and Lie algebras \r\narise naturally, and the basic understanding of these objects have been \r\nused in applications involving biology, physics and chemistry. \r\nThese algebraic objects have complicated internal symmetries. \r\nInformation about the representation and cohomology theories \r\nallows one to organize and extract vital information that can \r\nbe used in these various applications. The principal investigator \r\nhas been actively promoting the working knowledge of these \r\nmethods. He is currently organizing several conferences in \r\nrepresentation/cohomology theory and is a co-organizer \r\nof the VIGRE (Vertical Integration of Research and Education) Algebra \r\nGroup at the University of Georgia which promotes learning through \r\nactive faculty and student participation. \r\n\r\n",
