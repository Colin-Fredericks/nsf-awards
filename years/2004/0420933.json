 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal, acquiring a high-end scanner device for high-precision mapping and visualization applications, supports research in various projects in civil engineering and architecture ((re-)engineering in as-built environments), computer graphics (body motion), robotics (humanoid robotics locomotion), and haptics (force-based manipulation) among others. The research constitutes a substantial change in approaching disciplines where the loss of information (due to current-generation site) and equipment form major barriers. Improving the accuracy and quantity of information capture for direct applications in construction management, for object recognition and classification, and for model building more broadly, the work addresses the following projects:\r\nInformation technology enabled construction management with research on early detection and management of defects at construction sites, and utilization of advanced technologies in dynamic service networks,\r\nComputational building evaluation in architecture with simulation of building designs and visualization of as-built environments,\r\nComputer graphics and humanoid robotics with specific research on high fidelity animation, perception/performance experiments in virtual environments, humanoid locomotion among obstacles and force-based manipulation, and\r\n3D perception with specific on-going and future research on model building, object recognition, and classification.\r\nBroader Impact:  The infrastructure, supporting research across multiple departments, includes improvement on 3D scanning technology and 3D content acquisition, and offers education and training in the use of the new scanning technology and its applications. The involvement of undergraduates appears particularly suitable due to the promise of new engineering approaches.\r\n",
