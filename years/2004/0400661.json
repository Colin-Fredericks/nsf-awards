 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spintronics is an emerging area in solid state science and engineering.  Its broad goal is to utilize carriers' spin to realize novel electronic devices that rely on the creation, manipulation, and detection of spin and spin-currents.  If successful, such manipulation of spins can also have impact on another emerging, and perhaps even more exotic, field of quantum computing, as spin is the leading candidate for registering the quantum bit of information in the proposed quantum computers. The goal of this project is to explore ballistic spin transport in clean, two-dimensional carrier systems in AlAs quantum wells where, thanks to their large effective g-factor, the electrons can be spin-polarized with a modest magnetic field (~ 1T). The project involves the crystal growth of the basic materials, via molecular beam epitaxy, the fabrication of various devices using optical and electron-beam lithography, and transport measurements.\r\n\r\nThe project incorporates a high quality and comprehensive educational component.  The PI is dedicated to the education of both graduate and undergraduate students, and the project will result in the education of students in critical, state-of-the art areas of science and technology, including the fabrication, characterization, and physics of high quality layered semiconductor structure.  The PI is also committed to a broader education of the public in science and engineering.  He participates in various K-12 teacher training programs in electricity and magnetism, general areas that are linked to the topic of this proposal.  The programs include training sessions, kit development, and demonstrations at regional schools.\r\n",
