 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is the development of theory, statistical \r\nmethodology, and computational\r\nmethods for use in mixture models in high dimensional data. In the \r\ntheoretical portion, the investigator\r\nenhances the potential statistical applications of these models by \r\nexamining their topographical structure and their relationship to other \r\nhigh-dimensional methods such as local linear regression and\r\nhierarchical trees. New kernel densities are being constructed by the use \r\nof the idea of\r\ndiffusion processes. New methods to assess the important aspects of \r\nidentifiability in these models\r\nare under development. In addition to these basic theoretical developments, \r\nthe investigator is creating a set of methods designed to fit diffusion \r\nmixture models, and to assess their fit,  in high dimensions. A key part of \r\nthis methodological development is occuring in computational enhancements.\r\n\r\nThe statistics community is faced with a great challenge by modern science, \r\nand that is to\r\ndevelop new tools for scientific inference in the aftermath of the data \r\nrevolution.  Modern data is potentially high in dimension, and massive in \r\nthe number of collected units. The probability models called mixture models \r\nhave had a long history of use in describing heterogeneity in data samples. \r\nThey are extremely flexible, and provide a compact picture of the key \r\nfeatures of the data structure. Unfortunately, limited theoretical \r\ndevelopments in this difficult area have held back their use in high \r\ndimensional problems. This research project targets a number of the key \r\ndifficulties remaining in this area, including the integration of this \r\nmethodology with other existing ones, the expansion\r\nof this methodology into new data types, and a better understanding of this \r\nmodel's structure in\r\nvery high dimensions. The methods that arise from these developments are \r\nbeing turned into computational packages so that they can be used by \r\nscientists.\r\n\r\n",
