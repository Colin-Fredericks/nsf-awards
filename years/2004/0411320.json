 "awd_abstract_narration": "UTEP is increasing the success rates of undergraduate engineering students by adapting methods from the New Mexico State University. The methods address multiple intelligences and are\r\nimplemented in a peer facilitator environment. The project integrates hands on demonstrations, computer simulations, and other learning aids into a collaborative undergraduate engineering classroom to produce deeper understanding of the basics of engineering. Expectations include higher pass rates and better longitudinal performance as compared to historic data.\r\n\r\nConsider for example, the scenario in which a group of students studying dynamics are shown a vibratory feeder in which screws seem to magically walk themselves up a ramp into a predetermined location where they are picked up by a robot. The phenomenon is a simple application of stick/slip friction. The students experiment with the device to discover how it works, use a simulation to determine the effect of changing parameters, then design a new vibratory input to move the screws as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nFormative assessment measures are being used to direct the curriculum development. Summative assessments are being used to test the efficacy of the interventions in both the short and long term.\r\n",
