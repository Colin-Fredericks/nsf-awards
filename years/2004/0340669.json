 "awd_abstract_narration": "0340669\r\nZhu\r\nThis award supports Xiaoyang Zhu and students from the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities in a collaboration with Martin Wolf of the Department of Experimental Physics at the Free University of Berlin, Germany.  The overarching goal of this collaboration is to develop model molecule-silicon interfaces and to carry out dynamic measurements on interfacial electron transport using femtosecond two-photon photoemission and sum-frequency generation spectroscopies.  Building electronic devices from single or a small group of molecules has taken the center stage in diverse research fields, including chemistry, physics, and engineering.  While it is exciting to note the increasing number of demonstrations of molecular electronic devices, our present understanding of molecular electronics remains at a phenomenological and qualitative level.  This award supports a spectroscopic approach to probe the fundamental mechanisms underlying molecular electronics using model system.  While the German group is expert on ultrafast dynamics, particularly electron dynamics, at molecule-solid interfaces, the US group has expertise in characterizing electronic structure at metal-molecular junctions and in developing chemical processes for the synthesis of molecule-silicon interfaces.  The two groups will combine their expertise and address fundamental questions relevant to molecular electronics using model molecule-silicon interfaces.  Currently, Zhu is funded by an NSF grant (DMR-0238307) to address electronic structure and dynamics in organic semiconductors and at organic-metal interfaces.  Adding an international dimension to this project will significantly enhance the research capabilities of Zhu's group and extend the exploration to include organic silicon interfaces.  The attractiveness of integrating molecular electronic components to silicon surfaces can be realized from the prominent status of silicon in electronics technology and the availability of vast knowledge on the physics and chemistry of silicon surfaces.\r\n\r\nAs in many fields of modern science/technology, molecular electronics is inherently multidisciplinary.  This collaborative project will allow Chemistry graduate students in Zhu's group to obtain training in cutting edge experimental methodology and techniques in the Physics laboratory of Prof. Wolf.  Similarly, Physics students/posdocs from the Wolf group will gain experience in designing and synthesizing model chemical systems.  In addition, these students will also gain valuable experience in cultural aspects of scientific research.  Thus, the synergy from such collaborative effort goes well beyond scientific output.\r\n",
