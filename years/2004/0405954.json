Secondly, we will also study possible topologies of closed\r\ngeodesic nets on surfaces. Thirdly, we will try to resolve the\r\nfollowing problem posed by M. Gromov: Is it true that all closed\r\ngeodesic nets on a compact surface always form a dense subset?\r\nFourthly, we will be interested in curvature-free bounds for the\r\nsmallest area of a non-trivial minimal surface in a closed Riemannian\r\nmanifold. In another direction we will be studying Morse landscapes of\r\nRiemannian functionals and functionals on spaces of\r\nsubmanifolds. Earlier we developed methods based on recursion theory\r\nthat enable one to prove that Morse landscape of many interesting\r\nfunctionals on these spaces are extremely complicated. Now we will try\r\nto develop methods yielding quantitative information about graphs of\r\nthese functionals and to extend our approach to a wider class of\r\nfunctionals that includes Sobolev norms of various curvatures\r\nnormalized by a power of volume.\r\n\r\nWhen one studies the geometry of the round sphere one naturally\r\nnotices the equator, meridians and other ``big\" circles on it. These\r\ncurves are examples of closed geodesics. Now let us deform the sphere\r\nso that it is not round. Remarkably, there still will be closed\r\ngeodesics on this surface, and the shortest of them will not be too\r\nlong. We would like to know how exactly its length is related to the\r\narea and the diameter of the deformed surface.  We will also study\r\nsimilar questions for Riemannian manifolds that are higher dimensional\r\ngeneralizations of surfaces.  On the other hand note that the round\r\nsphere has the nicer shape than all deformed spheres. It is less clear\r\nwhat is the nicest shape of the torus (the ``pretzel\").  We are going\r\nto investigate what happens in higher dimensions where typically there\r\nare infinitely many competing ``nice\" shapes and a lot depends on what\r\nexactly do we mean by ``nice\".\r\n\r\n",
