 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business  Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project addresses a scanning thermal microscope (SThM) system, which can be used for measuring thermal parameters such as temperature, thermal conductance, and heat capacity in nanotechnology, semiconductor, and biological applications. The SThM system consists of a micromachined scanning probe, an interface  circuit, a scanning stage,  and instrumentation to synchronize and control the individual components.  This proposal addresses critical issues regarding its feasibility as a commercial product by evaluating the manufacturability, robustness, accuracy, repeatability, and ease of use of the SThM system as a whole and by extending the potential applications.\r\n\r\nThe tool  is  intended  for  use  not  only  by researchers, but also for pre-college education in nanotechnology and microelectronics. It is also intended for use in process monitoring for yield and reliability in manufacturing applications.  Since the technology being evaluated for commercialization originated in an educational institution and will be licensed from it, this effort will indirectly serve to support higher education if successful. This  effort  will  also  provide  an  avenue  for  undergraduate  student  involvement  in  a variety  of  areas  ranging  from microfabrication  to  circuit  design  to  testing  the  scanning \r\nthermal systems.",
