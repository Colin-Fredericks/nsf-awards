 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose organizing a workshop on Supply Chain Management with specific focus on green supply chain management, international supply chain management, and auction and pricing strategy at the University of Florida.  The objective of this workshop is to bring together experts from academia and business practice to engage in a discussion on the state-of-the-art in supply chain management and the critical problem areas and future directions within this field.  Specifically, the four main goals of this workshop are, through the participation of academic and industry participants, to: characterize the problems and challenges facing leading-edge manufacturing and service firms in the areas of green supply chain management, international supply chain management and online auctions;  define the state-of-the art technological and decision support capabilities currently available to industry;  identify the new technological and decision support solution capabilities needed for both meeting newly arising challenges faced by industry and for driving new sources of strategic and competitive advantage; and identify and define academic research opportunities and challenges for developing new technological and decision support solution capabilities sought by industry.\r\n\r\nRecent advances in information technology and the growth of electronic commerce activity over the Internet have reduced barriers to globalization, and as a result, competency in on-line procurement and international supply chain management are becoming critical success factors.  At the same time, organizations have found that the benefits of green supply chain management extend far beyond simply meeting regulatory requirements and can lead to improved sources of efficiency and cost reduction. We propose to focus on these three important emerging trends in supply chain management practice during this workshop. In particular, we will discuss innovative solution approaches to overcome the significant complexities within these areas.\r\nThe goal of our workshop is to bring together leading-edge researchers and practitioners in order to define the critical research problems within the three focus areas for the next decade. We plan to solicit papers from both academic and industry participants and publish workshop proceedings. The proceedings should contain a set of papers written by presenters that both captures the content of the presentation and summarizes the major points made during the discussions.\r\n",
