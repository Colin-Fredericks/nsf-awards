 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal seeks funds to evaluate alternate routes to teacher certification in Missouri.  The policy dilemma that drives the study is: How to address teacher shortages in secondary mathematics and science, without sacrificing high teacher quality.  The proposal is designed to provide a knowledge base from which to consider policy options. Methodology includes clarification of alternative routes to certification, examination of classroom practices of teachers in the programs, and comparison of characteristics and program outcomes of teachers in the different certification patterns. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe application of a theory-based approach in this field is unique and will provide valuable new information to the field. A general model of ATCPs has been developed to guide instrument development or adaptation. The goals and general strategy for addressing this important problem is a multi-measure multi-method study focusing on the alternative certification programs preparing the greatest number of mathematics and science teachers. Both case studies and comparative outcome research studies are planned. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe study has local practical importance but also has potential for generating guidelines for practice and hypotheses for further study. The use of an external group of scholars to address the study outcomes in an invited forum is one of many dissemination approaches that combine critical analysis with informing a broader audience of the contemporary findings. The combination of deep description with comparative analyses provides the kind of knowledge that can inform practice in different settings. \r\n",
