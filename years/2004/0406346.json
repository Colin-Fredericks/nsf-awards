T. Yau conjectured that the existence of \r\nKaehler metrics with constant scalar curvature is related to the stability of \r\nthe underlying polarized manifold. In recent years, striking progress has \r\nbeen made in this direction. In 1997, G. Tian proved that any \r\nKaehler-Einstein manifold with positive scalar curvature is K-Stable. In\r\n2001, S. K. Donaldson proved that an algebraic manifold with discrete \r\nautomorphism group and Kaehler metric of constant scalar curvature is Chow stable.\r\nVery recently, in a joint work with G. Tian, the proposer proved that \r\nthe existence of Kaehler metrics of constant scalar curvature implies Semi-K\r\nStability of the K energy with respect to the given cohomology class. \r\nInspired by these results, the proposer wants to study a network of problems \r\ncentered around the existence of extremal Kaehler metrics (which includes \r\nconstant scalar curvature metric as a special case), stability of polarized Kaehler \r\nmanifold, and other related problems. The main ideas of solving these problems\r\nconsist of improving regularity for geodesics in the space of Kaehler metrics in \r\nthe sense of T. Mabuchi, of understanding the long-time existence of the Calabiflow, \r\nand of the convergence of the Kaehler-Ricci flow. These ideas are related to different \r\nmathematical fields but the proposer believes that they are all very promising to solve the Conjecture of  Yau (in particular to solve the problem of the existence of Kaehler-Einstein \r\nmetrics on Fano manifold). The proposer is going to work on the problems through \r\nthese ideas.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the existence of Kaehler metrics of constant\r\nscalar curvature, being the key problem in differential geometry, has \r\nstrong impact to other fields of sciences like physics. According to Albert\r\nEinstein, the theory of gravity can be interpreted as the geometry of \r\nspace-time. Thus the research in differential geometry is crucially important in \r\nphysics and cosmology. The research proposed also has impact in string theory, \r\nwhich is the theory of unifying all four basic forces of the Nature. The \r\nproposer's work, together with the works of other mathematicians and physicists, \r\nhelps in understanding our Universe.\r\n",
