 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Izumi Shimada and his team of\r\nspecialists and students will conduct two seasons (2004 and 2005) of\r\narchaeological fieldwork at the famed pre-Hispanic religious center of\r\nPachacamac just south of the city of Lima on the central coast of Peru.\r\nPachacamac was one of the most revered and durable prehistoric\r\nreligious/pilgrimage centers in the Andean region, arguably the Mecca of\r\nthe Americas. Today, along with Macchu Picchu, it is one of the best-known\r\nand oft-visited monuments of Peru. The powerful patron deity of this center\r\nwas much feared even by the mighty Inkas, who often consulted its oracle.\r\nFollowing Spanish conquest of the Andean world and the imposition of\r\nCatholicism, the deity was transformed into the Purple Christ and\r\ncontinues today to command the fervent devotion of millions of modern\r\nresidents of Lima and surrounding areas. \r\n\r\nWith the participation of archaeologists, botanists, chemist, historian, and zoologist from Germany,\r\nJapan, Peru and the U.S., this research aims to clarify the (1) identity,\r\norganization, and roles of the residents of this center, and (2) the role\r\nenvironmental conditions played in its remarkable longevity, resilience and\r\npower. To attain the first goal, we will excavate three areas near the base\r\nof the sacred Temple of Pachacamac. The 2003 survey of this area using\r\nground-penetrating radar (GPR) revealed the presence of superimposed remains\r\nof what are thought to have been residences and workshops down to depths of\r\n6 to 7 m below surface that were built over the 1500 plus years of nearly\r\ncontinuous prehistoric occupation. In 2004, the team will conduct a supplementary\r\nGPR survey to improve understanding of buried architecture. The second\r\naim will be achieved through analysis of sediment cores to be extracted from\r\nthe two small ponds situated within and just outside of Pachacamac.\r\nComposition and relative frequencies of pollens, diatoms, sediments, and\r\nanimal and plant remains in the superimposed layers of sediments should\r\nallow reconstruction of local climate and ecology, including the effects of\r\ndroughts and El Nino events. \r\n\r\nThis research is important for a number of\r\nreasons: It will (1) advance our understanding of the role of ancient\r\nreligious centers in social integration and political centralization, (2)\r\nrefine approaches to understanding their operation and maintenance, and (3)\r\nelucidate the relationship between the ebb and flow of religious centers and\r\nassociated ideology, on the one hand, and environmental conditions, on the\r\nother. The research is also critical in promoting international and\r\ninter-disciplinary collaboration, as well as the training of American and\r\nforeign students.\r\n",
