 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to aid and expedite the development of optimally designed\r\nnanoscale double-gate (DG) FinFETs for integrated circuit (IC) applications beyond the gatelength\r\nscaling limit (Lg < ~45nm) of today's conventional, or classical CMOS technologies.\r\nAlthough FinFET technology is related to conventional MOSFET technology, the nonclassical\r\nDG device is quasi-planar with the channel and source/drain extensions formed in an ultra-thin\r\nvertical silicon (Si) fin. Thus, the device processing is complicated because of uncertainties in\r\nhow dopant impurities diffuse in such thin fins, and the device design is complicated because of\r\ncomplex physics underlying the electrostatics and carrier transport in such thin fins. The research\r\nwill address these complications in both device processing and device design, as well as project\r\nperformances of nanoscale-FinFET CMOS. It will be based in large part on a physics-based\r\ncompact model (UFDG) for generic DG MOSFETs, having a small number of process-based\r\nparameters that relate directly to the device structure as well as the underlying physics. The\r\nprocess/physics basis of UFDG renders it quasi-predictive and, when implemented in a circuit\r\nsimulator, capable of projecting nonclassical CMOS performance and its sensitivity to expected\r\nfluctuations in the fabrication process. The research will comprise three stages, all of which could\r\nnecessitate UFDG upgrades. First, UFDG, supplemented by a suite of numerical device\r\nsimulators, will be used for inverse modeling of FinFETs fabricated at Freescale Semiconductor\r\n(formerly part of Motorola) to learn how to effectively dope the Si fins, e.g., the source/drain\r\nextensions, and how to characterize doping profiles in the fins. Second, UFDG and the\r\nsupplemental tools will be used to optimally design FinFETs, e.g., with regard to gatesource/\r\ndrain underlap (and bias-dependent Leff > Lgate) and its control of short-channel effects\r\nand the Ion/Ioff ratio. Third, UFDG/Spice3 will be used to project CMOS performances with\r\noptimal FinFET designs. Technological support from Freescale will aid, verify, and demonstrate\r\nthe optimal designs.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the research is reflected by its two main contributions: (1) physical\r\ninsights and guidance regarding the optimal design and fabrication of nanoscale FinFETs,\r\nincluding experimental demonstration, and (2) a reliable physics-based compact model that could\r\nbe used for future design of CMOS circuits comprising nanoscale FinFETs, in addition to aiding\r\nthe device technology development. The broader impacts of the research will be on the\r\neducation of students and engineers in the area of nonclassical nanoscale device technologies and\r\nphysics, with emphasis on FinFETs but with a broad basis for application to other, potentially\r\nviable IC technologies that can be scaled beyond the limit of conventional CMOS. New graduate\r\ncourses will be defined based on the research. And, by promoting the continual advancement of\r\nnanoscale IC technologies, the semiconductor industry and its customers will be impacted\r\npositively.",
