 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of this Nanoscale Exploratory Research (NER) project is to develop a general method capable of synthesizing nanoparticles and assembling them into extended regular, single and crossed, linear arrays, and to gain insight into why the alignment phenomenon takes place. The approach is to combine two main techniques: thin film deposition and laser irradiation, in a manner designed to avoid the use of masks and minimize multi-step processing.  As the atoms are being deposited, laser light will force them to joint into nanoparticles in well ordered lines. The spacing between lines can be changed by changing the angle of incidence of the light. \r\n\r\nThe development of a processing method for generating and manipulating nanostructures that is simple, very general, very fast and well suited for building devices represents a significant advance. It could become an important tool to enable the integration of nanoscale manufacturing with existing technologies, for many applications. In foresight, the development of powerful and versatile means for producing and assembling nanoparticles will encourage the design and testing of devices.  The integration of research and education will be strongly implemented, in harmony with the mission of the University of Tennessee. The specific educational planning includes the training of two students, one graduate and one undergraduate, to conduct focused research on materials in the forefront of engineering applications using state-of-the-art equipment and appropriate scientific methodology.  A web site will be developed where the research performed will be described for instructional and information purposes.",
