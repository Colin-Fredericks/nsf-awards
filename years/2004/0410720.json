This CCLI Adaptation and Implementation project supports biological literacy through the infusion of problem- and case-based lessons in a non-majors biology course.  The project adapts curriculum materials from SENCER, BioQuest and Workshop Biology, utilizing Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and inquiry-based laboratories to teach the core concepts of biology from the perspective of civically engaging issues or problems.  Introducing problems of timely importance and local interest provides a context and reason for learning.  Using a constructivist approach, students participate in semi-weekly assemblies, and are challenged to propose solutions to science-related societal problems. Related inquiry-based laboratories are designed to engage students in the process of scientific discovery within the context of real-world problems.  The project also provides training for teaching assistants and for other faculty members at the institution, so that the reform effort may be applied to other courses. Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALG) is used to examine students' pre- and post-course views about various aspects of science-technology-society. This project has the potential to improve scientific literacy among students not planning to major in science.",
