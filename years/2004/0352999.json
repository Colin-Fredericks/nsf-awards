 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is in the spirit of Hilbert's Eighteenth problem, to\r\nstudy the symmetries of the optimally dense packings, by spheres or\r\npolyhedra, of Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces of general dimension.\r\nVery few particular such packing problems have ever been solved, but\r\nour goal is more directed to study such problems as a class, to\r\nspecify them so that they are well-posed, with reasonable conditions\r\nfor existence and uniqueness, and in particular to then study the\r\nsymmetries of the solutions. This work is motivated in part by the\r\ndiscovery of aperiodic tilings, such as the Penrose tilings of the\r\nplane by the kite and dart polygons, tilings which can be understood\r\nas solutions of such a packing problem. The symmetries of aperiodic\r\ntilings have long been connected with the mathematics of ergodic\r\ntheory, using either the translation group or the full congruence\r\ngroup of the space being tiled as the dynamics. The symmetry of the\r\ntilings has then been related to the conjugacy class of the associated\r\ndynamical system. Several questions are proposed here about the\r\nsymmetry of packing problems, some directed at general qualitative\r\nbehavior and some directed at important special cases. For instance,\r\nit is proposed to show that the symmetry of the densest packings of a\r\nhyperbolic space by spheres of fixed radius is different for different\r\nradii. (It is already known that for most radii the densest packings\r\nare aperiodic - they cannot have crystallographic symmetry.) And more\r\ngenerally it is proposed to show that a \"generic\" packing problem, in\r\nEuclidean or hyperbolic space, only has optimal solutions which are\r\nnot crystallographic.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has tried to squeeze as many pennies as possible onto a\r\ntabletop has seen that the most efficient arangement is also very\r\nsymmetrical, with six pennies surrounding each. The similar problem\r\nfor efficient packings of spheres in space also leads to high\r\nsymmetry. But there is almost nothing known about precisely why, in\r\ngeneral, efficiency leads to symmetry, and what kinds of symmetry are\r\npossible. Twenty years ago a new metallic alloy was discovered, a\r\nphysical solution to a closely related optimization problem, and the\r\nalloy was found to possess a symmetry the nature of which is much less\r\nobvious, or, put another way, in which the mathematics of the symmetry\r\nis less well developed. This proposal concerns the study of the\r\nsymmetries of efficient arrangements in space of spheres and polyhedra\r\nand in particular the development of a mathematical formalism in which\r\nsuch symmetries can be usefully analyzed. Particular questions about\r\nthe nature of efficient packings of spheres are also specified.\r\n",
