Many of\r\nthese problems concern Thompson's group, a fascinating group which\r\nappears in varied branches of mathematics, from logic to algebra\r\nto homotopy theory and group theory.  The principal investigator\r\nplans to explore questions ranging from amenability to\r\nquasi-isometries of this group.  Additionally, the investigator\r\nproposes to extend prior work on quasi-isometries of lattices,\r\nworking with colleagues to finish a quasi-isometry classification\r\nof s-arithmetic lattices.  This would complete a project worked on\r\nby many geometric group theorists that has led to the introduction\r\nof interesting new techniques. Finally, the principal investigator\r\nplans several projects concerning convexity properties of groups.\r\nWhile almost convexity is well understood, there are few examples\r\nof groups which are not almost convex but satisfy weaker convexity\r\nconditions.  She also seeks to expand the list of classes of\r\ngroups which are known to be almost convex.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator proposes several projects in the area\r\nof group theory. A group is a mathematical structure, often\r\nintroduced in the context of symmetries of a particular object.\r\nCertain properties of a set of symmetries can be extrapolated to\r\ndescribe abstract mathematical sets.  In her research, the\r\ninvestigator studies groups as geometric objects, using the\r\ngeometry to give greater insight into abstract properties. The\r\ninvestigator studies closely one particular group, named\r\nThompson's group after the researcher who first defined it.\r\nThompson's group can be understood geometrically using pairs of\r\nbinary trees, an approach which relates this group to questions in\r\ntheoretical computer science. Thus it provides an interesting\r\ninterdisciplinary application of abstract mathematics.\r\nAdditionally, Thompson's group is a favorite example or\r\ncounter-example to many questions in mathematics. There are many\r\nopen questions about this group which interest an international\r\ngroup of mathematicians.   In particular, the geometry of this\r\ngroup is not well understood, a question which interests the\r\ninvestigator greatly.  Mathematicians have a standard way of\r\ndescribing a \"picture\" of a group, which is sometimes difficult to\r\nconstruct. For certain groups, it is possible to ask a computer to\r\nconstruct this picture.  The principal investigator is interested\r\nin exploring an algorithmic property of some groups, called almost\r\nconvexity, which allows computer construction of the group.\r\n",
