 "awd_abstract_narration": "0403696  Akhatov  The proposed NER seeks to demonstrate the technical feasibility of a novel approach to the production of nano-sized particles with a relatively narrow size distribution and to evaluate its potential advantages and limitations. This vibrating nanotube-based nano powder production approach entails directing the flow of a stream of precursor vapor atoms into a temperaturecontrolled zone in which carbon nanotubes serve as sites of heterogeneous nucleation of nano particles. The vibration amplitude and frequency of the nanotubes are variably controlled to limit the growth of the droplets condensed on the vibrating nanotubes. The nano droplets grown to a controllably specified size are continuously shaken off the nanotubes. The shaken-off droplets are optionally directed to flow through a cooling or passivating zone to further prevent agglomeration. \r\nThe intellectual merit: The technological goal of the proposed exploratory research is to develop a method of using carbon nanotubes to produce nano particles of controllable sizes with a relatively narrow size distribution. In powder sintering, mono-dispersed particles are known to form a more uniform green microstructure, which allows for a better control over the resulting microstructure during densification. Size uniformity is also an important feature in many of the\r\nrealized or potential applications of nano particles, including a more uniform and bettercontrolled drug-release rate, more reliable catalytic effect, more reproducible membrane filtration result, and improved sensor selectivity. \r\nThe broader impacts: The present research will generate interesting results, which will be incorporated in a SBIR/STTR proposal as a further step toward commercialization of the proposed nano powder technology. The proposed technology could potentially lead to the establishment of a high-tech enterprise in the state of North Dakota.  Materials science and nanotechnology has been identified by NDSU as a priority research area targeted for growth.  The Provost of NDSU strongly supports a current effort to establish a campus-wide interdisciplinary BS/MS/PhD program in materials science and nanotechnology. The proposed research is in line with this mission and will have a significant impact on the initiation and growth of this important educational program.\r\n",
