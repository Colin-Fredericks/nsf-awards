 "awd_abstract_narration": "The subject area is in the area of multilinear singular integrals,  and some related maximal operators, with a particular emphasis on those  with some invariance properties with respect to modulations.   This is a new branch of Harmonic Analysis that has arisen within the last  decade.\r\n\r\nA distinguishing feature  of this area is the use of wave packet techniques which have  roots going back to seminal  work on convergence  of Fourier series by L. Carleson, and C. Fefferman about 40  years ago. Yet the use of these techniques was hardly felt outside the  subject of convergence of  Fourier series until 1995.   It was then that  M. Lacey and C. Thiele used related techniques to a long standing  conjecture of A. Calderon concerning  the bilinear Hilbert transform.\r\n\r\nIt is now understood, through the efforts of a sizable number of mathematicans, that these techniques are crucial to the study a wide  class of multilinear singular integral and maximal operators. The timing of these lectures occurs when there is already a body of sophisticated results, from  which are emerging signs of a beautiful theory.   Connections to other fields of mathematics are at the horizon.\r\n\r\nProfessor Thiele's will present this recent development in a series of lectures and there will be a few additional lectures by leading researchers in the subject.\r\n",
