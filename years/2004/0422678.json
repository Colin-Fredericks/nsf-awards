 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is the systematic exploration and characterization of low degree-of-freedom parallel kinematics schemes for manufacturing applications across multiple length scales. The approach to exploration will employ type synthesis and inversions of known and new schemes. The characterization will concentrate on kinematic analysis of the schemes, the results of which will be encoded in software tools to aid in the advancement of analysis techniques, design methodologies, and experimental techniques for machine tools based on such kinematics schemes. Proof-of-concept analysis will address two specific applications: a) high-bandwidth meso-scale stages and b) conjugation of low degree-of-freedom stages for flexible transfer line machining stations. In addition to addressing specific research goals, this project will undertake activities to involve undergraduate engineering students in the design, analysis and characterization of parallel kinematics stages for various manufacturing applications. Also, the project will provide opportunities for underrepresented high school students to experience research through summer programs.\r\n\r\nUpon successful completion, this project will have identified new and novel parallel kinematics schemes for high performance machine tools. The high-bandwidth meso-scale stages are expected to immediately contribute to high performance stages for the growing family of scanning probe instruments that are used in micro- and nano-technology. The software tools and analysis techniques will provide machine-tool designers and builders with the means to synthesize and analyze new machine-tool concepts that use parallel kinematics schemes. Finally, future scientists and engineers will have gained experience in research and development of advanced manufacturing machinery.",
