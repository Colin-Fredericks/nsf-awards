 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of the joint NSF/NASA High-Dependability Computing and \r\nCommunication\r\nSystems Research effort, this project is developing, adapting and \r\nintegrating a variety of program analysis techniques for the Real-time\r\nSpecification for Java (RTSJ). RTSJ is an emerging language extension\r\nfor Java that is designed for implementing concurrent time-critical\r\nembedded software, for example, the control software on NASA's\r\nrobotic Mars rovers. This type of software is notoriously difficult to\r\ntest and debug, and the model-checking, light-weight static and dynamic\r\nanalysis techniques being developed as part of this project promise to\r\nidentify bugs before software is deployed to the field and to produce\r\nsystems that function more reliably.\r\n\r\nA cornerstone of this project is the use of controlled experimentation \r\nto judge the effectiveness of new analysis techniques. As part of this \r\neffort, RTSJ programs and experimental frameworks will be developed that support\r\nrepeatable experimentation for determining analysis performance and the \r\nprecision of analysis results. Experiment findings will drive the refinement of\r\nanalysis techniques. Case studies using NASA testbed software will serve\r\nto evaluate the scalability and applicability to NASA-relevant software\r\nchallenges.\r\n\r\nIf successful, this project promises to provide developers of next \r\ngeneration real-time embedded software, both at NASA and throughout the embedded\r\nsystems domain, with a suite of powerful quality-assurance tools that \r\nwill allow them to more cost-effectively produce higher-quality systems.\r\nGiven the pace at which software is being embedded in our society's\r\ninfra-structure, this could have broad impacts on the degree to which \r\nwe can rely on such systems.\r\n",
