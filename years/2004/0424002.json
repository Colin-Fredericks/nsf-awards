The collaborators are US PI James Wild, Texas A&M University and Professor Dayananda Siddavatam of Sri Krishnadevaraya University in Anantapur, India.  The researchers propose to isolate different strains of organophosphorus pesticide degrading (opd) bacteria from several regions of the world.  This study will address questions about the function of the opd gene cluster and provide a bacterial model system for studying horizontal gene transfer.  It could result in very pertinent data on the opd gene cluster, horizontal gene transfer and the role of these genes in the growth of bacteria.  In addition to its contribution to fundamental understanding of the regulation and organization of bacterial opd genes, this research will have implications for the bioremediation of pesticides that are used worldwide to control major insect pests.  \r\n    \r\nScope:  The US investigator has chosen to collaborate with an Indian scientist that has substantial experience in bacterial genetics, regulation, and diversity of opd genes.  Combining the complementary intellectual resources of both US and Indian laboratories will greatly contribute to the eventual success of this project.  This is a new collaboration that will create an international relationship between the two groups and provide a fruitful training opportunity for young scientists.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
