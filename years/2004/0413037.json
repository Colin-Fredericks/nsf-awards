 "awd_abstract_narration": "Apart from deforestation, the over-hunting of game species is \r\nconsidered the greatest threat to tropical biodiversity.  Much of this \r\nhunting is conducted by rural people who rely on hunted game to meet their \r\ndaily subsistence needs.  This dissertation research by a cultural \r\nanthropologist at Penn State University examines the economic, nutritional, \r\nand environmental effects on hunting decisions in the Bosawas Biosphere \r\nReserve, Nicaragua.  The researcher will accompany indigenous Mayangna and \r\nMiskito hunters on their forays into the forest, and local field assistants \r\nwill concurrently collect data on unobserved hunts and alternative economic \r\nactivities.  These data will be used to test hypotheses about the ways in \r\nwhich hunters respond to household needs, climatic fluctuations, and \r\nwildlife abundance.  In addition to furthering the education and training \r\nof a young social scientist, this project will contribute to theoretical \r\nissues in human ecology, particularly issues related to human adaptive \r\nstrategies in tropical rain forest environments.\r\n             Broader impacts: This research has practical applications for \r\nconservationist agendas throughout Latin America.  Results of this research \r\nwill enhance the feasibility of scientifically-based wildlife management \r\nplans for rain forest inhabitants, thereby promoting the long-term \r\nconservation of tropical forest ecosystems.",
