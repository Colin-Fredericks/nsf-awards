Many\r\napplications are expected to the analysis of various families\r\nof L-functions\r\n\r\n  The theory of L-functions of one complex variable is\r\ncentral in modern number theory. Special values of\r\nL-functions have provided links  between such diverse\r\nareas of mathematics as algebraic geometry, topology,\r\nprobability and statistics,  the representation theory of\r\ninfinite dimensional Lie  groups,  and mathematical\r\nphysics. In contrast, the theory of L-functions of\r\nseveral complex variables (multiple\r\nDirichlet series) is still in its infancy. A large part of the\r\nfoundational  theory was developed\r\nby the PI's and Postdocs of this proposal, who have\r\nbeen collaborating in teams, over the\r\nlast twenty years. The accumulated scientific results,\r\ncombined with a mass sustained  joint effort of the\r\nPI's, now point to the possibility of  major breakthroughs.\r\nThere is also  an additional\r\ntraining component.  Workshops will be held each year\r\nas well as short courses aimed at attracting graduate\r\n   students, postdocs, and\r\nmathematicians in related fields. The motivation\r\nwill be to categorize and advertise\r\nthe major accessible problems in the field, to\r\nmap out progress made, and to prepare the\r\nparticipants for research projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
