 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe research and educational objectives of this CAREER project focus on the reaction-based processing of multi-phase materials designed for use at elevated temperatures.  Four different research projects have been outlined to investigate different aspect of reaction-based processing:  1) use of in situ reactions to tailor the interfacial chemistry in ceramic-metal systems; 2) determination of reaction mechanisms in ceramic-metal systems; 3) calculation and experimental verification of phase equilibrium diagrams in ultra-high temperature ceramic systems; and 4) development of new routes for the processing of Zr-based ceramics.  Taken together, these projects will provide new processing routes, better control of microstructure, improved knowledge of reaction mechanisms, and a fundamental understanding of phase stability in high temperature materials.  The results will benefit government and industry development of new aerospace vehicles and other systems that operate in extreme environments.  High temperature materials will also serve as the focus for educational activities that include the direct training of four graduate students and up to ten undergraduates as well as professional development activities for all Ceramic Engineering undergraduates at University of Missouri-Rolla.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of systems that convert heat into useful work (e.g., electrical power plants, internal combustion engines) can be increased by increasing the operating temperatures.  The materials used to construct these systems limit the maximum operating temperature.  When used at elevated temperatures, materials must be stable against reaction with other materials and must be resistant to internal physical changes that can alter performance over time.  This project will address the critical need for improved high temperature materials by increasing the fundamental understanding of processing-microstructure-property relations in high temperature systems.  The project will also facilitate the training of undergraduate and graduate students for potential careers in this field.\r\n",
