 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to Dickinson College supports Professors R. David Crouch and Cindy Samet to incorporate nanoscience and nanotechnology topics into the existing undergraduate Chemistry curriculum. The project involves three parts: development of a new laboratory course in nanoscience for non-science majors; integration of elements of nanoscience into the first three chemistry courses that science majors take; and implementation of a workshop on nanoscience for secondary science teachers in central Pennsylvania.  Objectives of the award include the development of new activities and the adaptation of previously reported experiments to provide science and non-science majors with hands-on exposure to nanoscience, to illustrate the role of chemistry in the emerging fields such as nanoscience, and to support science education in the local school districts.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education announcement, NSF 03-044, category NUE and was jointly funded by Divisions of Materials Research and Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Directorate for Geociences.",
