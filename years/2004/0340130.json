 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project involves the confinement of activator ions in nanocrystalline quantum dots to enhance the brightness and efficiency of LED-white lamps.  These quantum confined atom (QCA)-nanophosphors involve a single activator ion confined within a 2-7 nm nanocrystal host (quantum dot) of semiconductor and insulator.  The project objective involves the fabrication of the nanophosphors and characterization of their optical and thermal properties.  The project will demonstrate that the enhanced luminescent and thermal properties of the phosphors can be applied to high brightness white LEDs and conventional lighting products.  The improvements in lamp efficiency should be in the 15-50 percent range depending on the specific lamp.  The project will also study the dependency of light generation on temperature.  This would be of importance not only for the high-flux and high temperature operation of LEDs and arc lamps but would help in a basic understanding of the thermal properties of nanophosphors.\r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this technology is in the replacement of incandescent lamp lighting with solid state LEDs.  The cost of producing electricity is $60 billion annually in the US and lighting accounts for 20 percent of the consumption. Replacing incandescent lamps with efficient solid state LED lamps could result in huge savings and a significant reduction in electric consumption.",
