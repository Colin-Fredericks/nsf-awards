 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ian A. Gravagne, Baylor University, Real-Time Distributed Networks:  Dynamics Bandwidth Allocation via Adaptive Sampling \r\n\r\nThis research applies an emerging field of mathematics\r\nknown as Dynamic Equations on Time Scales to the problem of bandwidth\r\nutilization in real-time distributed control networks. Time scales\r\ntheory allows for the seamless analysis of dynamic processes on\r\ncontinuous, discrete, or mixed time domains, including non-uniform\r\ndiscrete time domains. Recent advances in time scales show that periodic\r\nservo control processes on distributed networks can adapt their timing\r\ncharacteristics in the presence of aperiodic high-priority traffic\r\nbursts without losing control of their plants. The adaptive servo timing\r\nmethod results in an increase in the effective available bandwidth for\r\naperiodic traffic and better integration of the overall\r\nplant/processor/network system. Study of the theory of time scales is\r\nleading to further advances toward the unification of continuous and\r\ndiscrete systems as well.  This unique application\r\nof an area of mathematics previously unknown to the computer science and\r\nengineering communities has the potential to stimulate external\r\nresearch into related topics such as network scheduling and real-time\r\ncontrol performance.\r\n\r\nThe project will pursue empirical validation of the new theory on a 40-node\r\nController Area Network of embedded processors developed at Baylor\r\nUniversity.  Successful research in this area has immediate\r\nutility and potential economic impact for a large industrial base\r\nemploying distributed control networks, notably in the automotive,\r\naerospace, and manufacturing industries.  Baylor's\r\nrelatively new graduate engineering programs will continue to support\r\nthe educational needs of engineers employed by local industries in the underserved Central Texas area. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
