 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Small Grant for Exploratory Research to assist in the development of a portable, lightweight version of the New Mexico Tech Lightning Mapping Array (LMA).  The LMA is a network of twelve VHF receivers employing GPS timing to measure the time of arrival of signals from lightning flashes with high precision.  Triangulation enables the 3-D mapping of the flashes in the vicinity of the network with extremely high resolution in space and time - information not otherwise available.  LMA data, especially in combination with radar storm patterns and in-situ measurements of the electric field with airborne instruments, have greatly advanced the understanding of thunderstorm electrification in the past few years.  This grant supports the development of a smaller version of the LMA that will be easily portable and quickly deployable for storm studies.  The portable version is feasible because of continued improvements and miniaturization of the individual receiving stations.  It will be small enough to enable lightning measurements in locations and situations that would not be possible otherwise because of logistics or other considerations.  Examples of the potential uses of the system are mobile deployment ahead of storms or from moving vehicles or aircraft, using battery-operated arrays with wireless communications for real-time lightning observations at sporting events or other situations where lightning hazards are a concern, or responding to unexpected opportunities, such as studying the lightning associated with volcanic eruptions.  Accurate triangulation of VHF signals, which is the operating principle of the LMA, opens the door to innovative and exploratory applications apart from lightning mapping.  These include locating faults on power transmission lines by the electrical discharges they produce, locating personnel carrying small \"pulser\" units, tracking balloons or airplanes carrying pulsers, and locating and characterizing radio frequency noise emissions from buildings.",
