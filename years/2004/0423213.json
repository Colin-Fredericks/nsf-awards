H. Lehman College and Gadadhar Misra, Poornaprajna Institute of Scientific Research, Bangalore.  They will address a number of open questions on homogeneous operators, including the classification of Cowen-Douglas operators.  Combining Koranyi's expertise in representation theory with that of Indian collaborator Misra on homogeneous operators has considerable potential for solving basic problems in a difficult, high-risk, high-gain area of investigation.  This collaboration could contribute significantly to fundamental knowledge and lead to substantial progress in solving well-known problems in operator theory.    \r\n\r\nScope:  The US and Indian investigators are distinguished mathematicians with complementary backgrounds and will join forces in trying to solve difficult technical problems.  The collaboration is likely to advance operator theory and broadly impact those working in the field.  It will have a beneficial effect on the teaching and research activities at both the CUNY Graduate Center and at the Poornaprajna Institute in Bangalore\r\n",
