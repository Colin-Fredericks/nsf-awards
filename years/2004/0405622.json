Many problems in differential geometry, optics,\r\nand other areas of mathematics and engineering are in\r\nthis class. Recently discovered deep connections between such equations\r\nand Monge-Kantorovich optimal mass transfer theory in Euclidean space\r\nand on manifolds will also be studied.\r\nAmong the topics that will be considered are the following.\r\n(1) Development of geometrical and analytic techniques for solving \r\nproblems requiring determination of reflecting and refracting \r\ninterfaces with capabilities to transform intensity\r\ndistributions in a prescribed manner. \r\n(2) Investigation of geometric problems involving hypersurfaces \r\nwith prescribed curvature functions and geometric inequalities \r\nwith emphasis on variational methods, especially,\r\nthose connected with Monge-Kantorovich theory; applications \r\nof these variational methods to problems in convexity, \r\nin particular, to the Minkowski problem and\r\nits various generalizations,  will be studied as a part of this program.\r\n(3) Development of geometrically motivated, provably convergent and \r\nefficient multi-scale numerical methods for solving nonlinear \r\nsecond order PDE's arising in reflector/refractor problems of optics \r\nand in geometric problems involving curvature functions and maps with \r\ncontrolled volume. \r\n\r\nNonlinear partial differentials equations expressing energy conservation \r\nlaws as a constraint on the Jacobian of a map describing a physical\r\nphenomenon are very common in science and engineering. For example,\r\nin optics such equations arise naturally in problems\r\nrequiring determination of interfaces with prescribed\r\nrefractive and/or reflective properties; in astrophysics these equations\r\nhave to be solved when the shape of targets in the solar\r\nsystem must be determined from indirect and limited set of measurements;\r\nin weather prediction models based on quasi- and semi-geostrophic\r\napproximations of atmospheric motion such equations describe\r\nenergy conservation laws; in computer science the same type of\r\nequations arise in problems connected with radiosity estimates.\r\nTypically, the theoretical analysis and numerical solution of\r\nthese equations is very difficult because of their highly nonlinear\r\nstructure. Fortunately, the geometric content common to all these problems\r\nprovides important insights leading to effective methods for their\r\ninvestigation and numerical solution. Development of such methods\r\nis the main goal of this research.\r\n\r\n",
