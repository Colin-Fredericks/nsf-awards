 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site program at Wellesley College for 10 students in a 10-week program for 3 summers.  The program will focus on the exploration of the social roles of women, and will expand the current undergraduate research program to include students from other institutions.  Undergraduates will collaborate on research projects with faculty from all the social science departments (anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology), the Women's Studies Department, and members of the Wellesley Centers for Women.  The students will engage in research projects with faculty in which they collect and analyze data from various sources, and prepare reports.  They will present the results of their work at weekly seminars.  The students will also attend a series of workshops on statistical analysis, obtaining and presenting electronic data, public speaking and poster presentations, and participate in a campus-wide poster session at the end of the program.\r\n\r\nThis program will advance our knowledge of the role that gender plays within our society.  The Wellesley faculty has led the way in providing insights on the many ways that gender affects social dynamics.  The secondary impact of the program will be the development of the students' critical thinking and research skills.  The acquisition of these intellectual skills will complement their classroom experiences, and broaden their ability to work independently.\r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
