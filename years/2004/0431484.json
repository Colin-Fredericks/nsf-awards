This proposal will cover the program from 2004 through 2006.\r\nSix successful New Mexico Analysis Seminars have been held in Albuquerque and Las Cruces over the last six years. After successful conferences funded by local sources, the\r\nlast three conferences have been sponsored by NSF.\r\nWe have reached a stage where outside funding is necessary to sustain the growth and quality of the seminars.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first conference will be held simultaneously with an AMS meeting in Albuquerque in October 2004. The main speakers are P. Bauman and L. Capogna. The second conference will be joint with\r\na CBMS-NSF conference to be held Las Cruces in May 2005, and have as centerpiece the lectures of T. Tao. In Spring 2006 we will return to our regular schedule.\r\n\r\nA large portion of the funds will be used to pay for the travel expenses of the participants attending the conferences, and for the lecturers. \r\n\r\nThe seminar has provided an invigorating but not intimidating atmosphere for young researchers. It has helped foster interactions among mathematicians in the area and beyond. Participating graduate students have been encouraged to pursue studies in areas related to analysis. The\r\nnetwork of Southwestern analysts has grown as a result of\r\nthese annual meetings. One of the main objectives is, and has been, to provide  graduate students\r\nwith exposure  to the forefronts of research in analysis, and to make the\r\nseminar a vehicle for them to present their work.\r\nThe organizers are deeply committed to encourage graduate students, female, and minority participation in the mathematical sciences in future seminars.\r\nThe list of past and future main speakers as well as the topics of the short talks demonstrate the vitality of Analysis taken in a broad sense and the\r\ndetermination of the organizers to make this conference a forum for the presentation of the latest significant results in the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
