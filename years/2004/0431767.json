 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intellectual merit of the CBSSS(Computing Beyond Silicon Summer School) program lies in fostering the development of this kind of researcher. The CBSSS program will bring together a unique collection of pedagogical and novel research materials representing the fundamental background knowledge necessary to work in this area and the fundamental challenges this area presents. 40-50 students, mostly undergraduates, will be fully funded to spend 4 weeks at Caltech hearing lectures from leaders in the emerging fields of quantum computation, biomolecular computation, and molecular electronics. Students will also hear\r\nlectures on core computer science and information theory which is directly relevant to these areas\r\nof research. The students will work in small teams on projects in this area and be able to turn to the\r\nlecturers and the broader Caltech physics of information community for project guidance. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of exciting students about these new areas and giving them the intellectual tools and pointers they need to properly get started into these research paths. We expect most students have been educated in their respective disciplines.  However, few undergraduates would currently be\r\nexposed to these novel substrates, much less cross-educated to think about them. Very few would\r\nhave adequate exposure to contemplate graduate research in this area, much less the confidence to\r\nwrite a credible statement-of-purpose for graduate study. Students completing this program should\r\nbe prepared to write such a Statement of Purpose and get involved with research in this area.\r\n\r\nAs a further benefit, materials for the program will be posted on the web, providing a central resource\r\nfor other students and for educators who wish to develop courses in this area at their own university.\r\nCBSSS will also have an impact on the participating faculty who have a unique opportunity to\r\ninteract with each other and share ideas. The program will help them better see common problems\r\nand possible solutions and identify collaboration opportunities.",
