 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) This project is providing effective undergraduate education in molecular biology using an integrated research-problem-based approach in an advanced, undergraduate course.  The entire course is presented within the framework of a research cloning experiment that the students complete in the laboratory.  At the end of the course the students generate their own research proposals with experiments that they can subsequently pursue.  The material for the course is being adopted from the NSF-sponsored Unraveling DNA text, and adapted to serve a student populace dominated by rural, first generation college students with significant numbers of female and African American students.  Adaptations include integration of the laboratory and classroom experience and modification of all laboratory exercises.  This project is increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in molecular biology, enhancing scientific literacy among the students, and integrating research and education by enhancing the institutional research and educational infrastructure.",
