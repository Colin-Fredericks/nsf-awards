Cecil\r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to study submanifolds of Euclidean\r\nspace and the unit sphere which have special curvature\r\nproperties.  Of particular interest are isoparametric\r\nhypersurfaces, which have constant principal curvatures, and\r\nDupin hypersurfaces, which have the property that each principal\r\ncurvature is constant along each of its curvature surfaces.\r\nAlthough these important classes of hypersurfaces have been\r\nstudied since the nineteenth century, many natural problems\r\nremain open at this time.  The principal investigator and his\r\ncollaborators, Quo-Shin Chi and Gary Jensen of Washington\r\nUniversity, will employ the method of moving frames on Legendre\r\nsubmanifolds in Lie sphere geometry in their research on these\r\nproblems.  This method is applicable to the study of any\r\nsubmanifold in Euclidean space, not just to those mentioned here,\r\nand it has been used successfully by the principal investigator\r\nand his collaborators in previous research.\r\n\r\nDupin hypersurfaces have been studied extensively since the\r\nintroduction of the cyclides of Dupin in 1822, and great progress\r\nhas been made over the past 25 years in their classification.\r\nDupin hypersurfaces have played a major role in various\r\nmathematical theories, such as the theory of taut embeddings, the\r\nstudy of Hamiltonian systems of hydrodynamic type, and the theory\r\nof higher-dimensional Laplace invariants. The cyclides of Dupin\r\nhave also apperared in recent papers on computer aided geometric\r\ndesign.  The study of isoparametric hypersurfaces in spheres was\r\ninitiated by the renowned French mathematician, Elie Cartan, in\r\nthe 1930's, and many mathematicians have made significant\r\ncontributions to this beautiful theory.  Included in the class of\r\nisoparametric hypersurfaces and their focal sets are many famous\r\ngeometric objects, such as the Veronese surface and the\r\nClifford-Stiefel manifolds, which have been studied by research\r\nmathematicians from several different points of view.  In terms\r\nof Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) activities and\r\nthe broader impact of the proposal, the principal investigator\r\nplans to continue his successful program of new course\r\ndevelopment and mentoring of individual students. Over the past\r\nfifteen years, this has resulted in 13 honors theses and a total\r\nof 25 students in geometry courses, who have attended or plan to\r\nattend graduate school in mathematics or related fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
