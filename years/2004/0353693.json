 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Thaddeus of the Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory will conduct a research program for the investigation of rotational and electronic spectra of postulated carbon and silicon molecules by means of laboratory Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy, in combination with a supersonic molecular beam, long-path millimeter-wave spectroscopy, and laser spectroscopy.  Previously unobserved species, such as silicon clusters and silicon hydrides, and reactive ring compounds, e.g., meta-benzyne, cyclopentadienylidene and tetradehydrobenzenes postulated by ab initio theory will be searched for and investigated.  In addition, investigations will be carried out on complex molecular ions, such as protonated ring-chains, ring-chain carbenes, and weakly polar molecules and complexes.  Many of these molecules are expected to play a role as reactive intermediates in industrial processes such as combustion and semiconductor growth processes, as well as in astronomy.  The work will serve to answer basic questions about the structure and bonding of carbon and silicon molecules of the same size.\r\n\r\nThe research will be conducted with the assistance of graduate and undergraduate students and post doctoral research associates.  These participants will acquire advanced training in contemporary physical chemistry in preparation for advanced studies or employment in the industrial, academic, or government sectors of our economy. Collaborations with experimental and theoretical groups in the USA and elsewhere will contribute to the conduct of the research.\r\n",
