 "awd_abstract_narration": "A continuing project relating to applications of pseudoframes for \r\nsubspaces (PFFS) is proposed. Pseudoframes are frame-like systems for \r\nthe linear analysis and synthesis of a subspace X.  They differ from \r\nframes in that both analysis and synthesis sequences are not necessarily \r\ncontained in X.  Theme 1 of the project studies constructions of \r\nbiorthogonal wavelets (via PFFS) that incorporate the regularity \r\nrequirement and the perfect reconstruction principle with practical \r\noptimal design criteria. Theme 2 studies the application of the \r\ngeometrical properties of PFFS in simultaneous noise removal and signal \r\nreconstruction. PFFS generate non-orthogonal projections onto X along \r\nany complementary subspace of X. This enables a technique of noise \r\nremoval by having the null space of the projection to contain the noise \r\nsubspace.  Studies in theme 3 will be on the applications of PFFS to \r\nsampling and linear inverse problems in noisy environments.  Given a \r\nconvolution or (non-ideal) sampling operation, one can apply PFFS to \r\nspecify an available reconstruction subspace X for the best \r\n(reconstruction) result. We will study examples of how accessible \r\nreconstruction subspaces X should be selected and how reconstruction or \r\ndeconvolution is carried out via PFFS. Performance of these techniques \r\nwill also be studied.\r\n\r\nAll signal analysis systems break a signal into components. The \r\nprincipal novelty that we introduce to signal analysis is the idea of \r\nPFFS systems. PFFS is a tool to analyze a subspace X while standing \r\noutside of X.  In doing so, one is given the freedom and additional \r\n\"room\" to perform signal decomposition and analysis in X by using \r\nadvanced means not available in X.  Consequently, PFFS systems are more \r\nflexible than most others in that they can be designed to produce the \r\nmost useful components for denoising and signal reconstruction purposes. \r\nThis study will develop multiple PFFS systems designed to solve a number \r\nof different signal analysis problems in broadband communications, \r\ntarget recognition, and signal/image restoration/de-blurring, etc. In \r\nparticular, we hope to advance the art of image compression to achieve \r\nhigh compression rate with the least artificial distortions such as \r\ncheck-boarding effect (showing checkerboards on the decompressed image) \r\nand ringing effect (showing blurring on the edges). Similarly, we expect \r\nto develop tools for improving speech signal compression by reducing \r\nleakage from one frequency band to another. More generally, the methods \r\nwe will develop can be tailored for noise removal and accurate \r\nreconstruction of digital signals in a number of different signal \r\nprocessing environments.\r\n",
