 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to harness mesoscale assemblies of organized mesoscale architectures of highly oriented multi-walled CNT's actuation and sensing using the microelectromechanical systems MEMS platform. In particular, we will create a new class of devices and microsystems using preferentially grown CNTs on Si-based MEMS structures. The CNT-MEMS hybrid structures will be fabricated by a combination of Si/SiO2 processing and a unique multidirectional CNT growth process.  We will then measure the mechanical actuation and response dynamics of a wide variety of structures including cantilevers, torsion beams, membranes of various shapes in inert and electrochemically active environments for applications such as electrical-pulse based triggering and sensing. transduction schemes in mechanical systems.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of this work enable the translation of the attractive properties of individual CNTs into a completely new \"break-through\" technology of nanotube-mesostructrure-based microdevices on silicon via standard micro and nanofabrication.  The proposed research has the potential to demonstrate a completely new \"break-through\" technology that will pave the path for integration of CNTs into MEMS platforms, yielding a variety of new nanotechnology-based microdevices actuators and sensors. The broader impacts involve interaction at many educational levels. Through connections previously established with the support of MESA(CA Science outreach program), the PI and the graduate students and/or REU's supported by this grant plan to visit science classes in the Junior high, and conduct science experiments related to nanoscale research.  This newly emerging and exciting area will serve as a medium in our outreach activities to attract bright high-school students to science and engineering.    \r\n",
