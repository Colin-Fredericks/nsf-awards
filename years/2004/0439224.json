The research is (1) to determine and compare the molecular basis for lubrication properties of bovine fetal and calf articular cartilage, and (2) to determine if mechanical loading modulates the content of adherent Lubricin/Superficial Zone Protein (Lub/SZP) at the articular surface of fetal and calf cartilage by affecting Lub/SZP synthesis, adhesion, or loss.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the biological and engineering mechanisms underlying the development of the low-friction surface of normal articular cartilage through a combination of biological, molecular, and biomechanical analyses. The experimental design is based on compelling preliminary data from prior research supported by NSF award BES 9987353. The educational component provides training to undergraduate and graduate students, and, through outreach activities, to students in grades 7-12.\r\n\r\nWork activities will enhance an existing liaison between academia (University of California San Diego) and industry (BREG, Inc.), drawing on the resources of both partners. The project integrates research, education, and industry in science, math, and engineering by directly engaging undergraduate and graduate students as well as industry engineers in this GOALI research project. The work plan provides a bridge of opportunity for early transfer of knowledge and technologies between academia and industry in the rapidly developing field of tissue engineering.\r\n",
