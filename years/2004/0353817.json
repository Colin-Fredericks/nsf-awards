 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systematics and evolution are central concepts in biological disciplines. Knowledge of the manner in which species are related to each other and the mechanisms by which they become distributed across the globe provide a framework (in evolutionary trees for example) for organizing and communicating ideas regarding biodiversity or comparative genomics. Our program provides students with a coherent, hands-on introduction to research in systematics and comparative evolutionary biology, and serves a critical role in attracting, inspiring and educating undergraduate students in the fundamental importance of these biological disciplines. Students enrolled in the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) REU program have at their disposal world-class collections of fishes, dinosaurs, reptiles, amphibians, mammals and invertebrates, as well as cutting edge research facilities in the Molecular Genomics laboratories, and the museum's research library. Projects are mentored by museum curators and variously include use of genetic, histological, anatomical or paleontological data and range from primary taxonomic to integrative phylogenetic studies.  Students will also be provided opportunities to immerse themselves in the richness of New York City's cultural institutions and summer venues. Eight students will be selected for a 10 week summer program at American Museum of Natural History REU program in Systematics and Evolutionary Biology. For more info, contact: Mark E. Siddall, 212 769 5638, siddall@amnh.org or visit http://research.amnh.org/grants/underprog.html.",
