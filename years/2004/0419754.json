Specifically, the instrumentation will be utilized as a key component of  materials design and discovery efforts in a) hybrid uranium oxide materials synthesis; b) templated metal-organic framework materials; c) electroactive and crystalline porous solids; d) lanthanide and ferrite nanoparticles; e) solution processable semiconductive solids. These areas have particular relevance to gas sensing, hydrogen storage, catalysis, electroactive materials, molecular recognition, magnetics and environmental stewardship/remediation of spent nuclear fuel. The dual nature of this instrumentation will allow dynamic, in situ studies of these systems (via powder diffraction) under controlled atmospheres as well as structure determination of novel synthetic products (via single crystal diffraction). Further, courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels will be enhanced and/or introduced to make use of this equipment and hence facilitate training for a range of students.\r\n\r\nWith support from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (NSF-MRI), the Chemistry Department at the George Washington University (GWU) will acquire an imaging plate (IP) based, dual purpose powder/single crystal X-ray diffractometer to promote research and education in the areas of organic, inorganic and materials chemistry. Targeted research areas include the synthesis of novel hybrid- and nano-materials with relevance to gas sensing, hydrogen storage, catalysis, electroactive materials, molecular recognition and environmental stewardship/remediation of spent nuclear fuel. Acquisition of this instrumentation will have an immediate and tangible impact on our ability to educate and train students in x-ray crystallography as we intend to develop courses for both graduate and undergraduate students. Specifically, novel experiments for our undergraduate Physical Chemistry Laboratory sections will be introduced, as will an advanced materials characterization course with x-ray diffraction as the central technique.\r\n",
