 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research focuses on imputation and variance\r\nestimation after imputation for survey data with nonresponse.\r\nThe investigator will study different models that relate auxiliary variables and \r\nthe variable to be imputed (e.g., parametric, non-parametric, \r\nand semi-parametric models); different response mechanisms\r\n(ignorable or non-ignorable); various imputation techniques (e.g., regression,\r\nnearest neighbor, and random imputation);\r\ndifferent types of estimators (e.g., sample mean and\r\nsample quantiles); and different types of data\r\n(e.g., cross-sectional, clustered, or longitudinal data).\r\nThe investigator will also study a pseudo empirical likelihood\r\nimputation method that provides more efficient survey estimators\r\nthan other imputation methods.\r\nFor each imputation method, variance estimation that takes \r\nnonresponse and imputation into account will be studied, using \r\na direct derivation approach or a replication method (such as \r\nthe jackknife, the balanced half samples, and the bootstrap)\r\nthat contains a re-imputation component to assess the variability\r\ncaused by imputation. \r\n\r\nMany statistics and government agencies collect data through surveys. \r\nMost surveys have nonresponse. Item nonresponse occurs when \r\nsome sampled units cooperate in the survey but fail to \r\nprovide answers to some questions. Imputation techniques, \r\nwhich insert values for nonrespondents, are commonly \r\nused compensation procedures for item nonresponse. In \r\nsome cases, when auxiliary information is properly used, \r\nimputation increases statistical accuracy. An essential \r\nrequirement for an imputation method is that one can \r\nobtain unbiased (or approximately unbiased) survey \r\nestimators and their variability estimators \r\nby treating the imputed values as observed \r\ndata and using the standard estimation formulas designed \r\nfor the case of no nonresponse. This requires developments\r\non imputation methodology and statistical analysis procedures\r\nto take nonresponse and imputation into account. Since \r\nmost of the proposed research topics are motivated by \r\nproblems in survey agencies such as the Census Bureau, \r\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics, Westat, and Statistics Canada, \r\nresults obtained from the proposed research will have \r\nsignificant impacts on the imputation and variance estimation \r\nmethodology for these survey agencies.\r\n",
