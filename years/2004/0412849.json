 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Physics at Fisk University will host a National Conference of Black Physics Students February 5-8, 2004 at Fisk University in Knoxville, TN.  This will be the 18th such annual Conference.  The goal of the meeting is to increase the diversity of physics.  The focus is on providing undergraduate physics majors and graduate students stimulation, motivation, and practical skills to further their education, as well as foster entry into and productivity in the scientific and technical professions.  As part of the meetings, numerous technical talks will be given, and students will have some course work in advanced physics problem solving.  Students will have informal meetings with university faculty and researchers, as well, to provide them with a view of physics from the professional perspective.  Funds are provided to cover the costs of student participation.  Many subfields of physics and related fields are to be represented.  Approximately 200 students will attend.",
