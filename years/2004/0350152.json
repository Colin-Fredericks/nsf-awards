 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is funding to partially support a research symposium that is expected to attract approximately 100-150 participants.  The behavior of social insects is a growing source of inspiration for computer scientists, especially those investigating algorithms for multi-agent systems and robotics.  The goal of the workshop, which will be the second in the series but the first to be held in the United States, is to bring computer scientists, biologists, robotics researchers, mathematicians and engineers together to share ideas: on how mathematical and algorithmic models of insect behavior might inspire solutions to problems in computing, planning and logistics; and on how methodologies and techniques from computing and engineering might be applied to the problem of understanding social insect behavior.  The PI's hypothesis is that such collaborations among computer scientists, roboticists and biologists may well lead to a cascade of new science in all these disciplines.  To this end, the PI intends to make special efforts to foster diversity among the participants, and to include a mixture of senior and junior researchers, practitioners, and students.  In particular, because it is likely that there will be some graduate students who may find it hard to justify the cost of attending a non-mainstream workshop to their departments or advisors, or who simply do not have the funds to attend, a large chunk of the funds will be earmarked for supporting participation by bright, interdisciplinary students and members of under-represented groups, who might not otherwise attend but who may have a significant impact upon the delegates.  The PI is soliciting funding from industry and from European agencies; the PI expects NSF funding will be used to support attendance by approximately 15 faculty and 20 students.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The workshop will help shape ongoing and future research projects in several disciplines, and will support timely cross-fertilization among them.  In particular, the meeting will help expand the involvement of graduate students in this synergistic effort, by providing them an opportunity to gain wider exposure in the community for their innovative work and to obtain feedback and guidance from senior members of the research community.  It will further help foster a sense of community among these young researchers, by allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality/cultural and scientific discipline, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the various fields.",
