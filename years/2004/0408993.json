Melrose and Victor Guillemin\r\n\r\nThe principal investigators propose to study a variety of basic\r\nquestions relating analysis, differential geometry and topology\r\nand especially concerned with the appearance of singular\r\nphenomena.  In various collaborations, they plan to study the\r\nsolvability properties of elliptic differential and\r\npseudodifferential operators on manifolds with singularities and\r\nto calculate the topological obstructions, particularly through\r\nK-theory, to invertibility. Jointly, and in other collaborations,\r\nthey also intend to continue the study of the propagation of\r\nwaves, typically in the form of singular fronts, on manifolds\r\nwith singularities and the relationship between these two\r\nproblems.  Projects in Kaehler and symplectic geometry emphasize\r\nmoment maps for groups acting on these spaces and constructions\r\nsuch as cutting, gluing, and reduction by groups of symmetries.\r\n\r\nOne of the features of several of these projects is the\r\nexpression of analytic objects on a global scale through the\r\ndifferential topology of the underlying space.  For example, many\r\ngeometric spaces carry versions of the equation describing wave\r\nmotion, and aspects of the shapes of the spaces are recorded in\r\nthe decay and scattering properties of waves on them.  This work\r\ntends to bring together various strands of research in\r\nmathematics and physics, in particular quantization theory and\r\nsymplectic geometry, the study of spaces on which Hamiltonian\r\nmechanics can be defined.\r\n",
