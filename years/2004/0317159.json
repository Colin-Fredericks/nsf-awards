This biennial conference is the primary international gathering of scientists focusing on the ecological correlates of behavior. The meeting brings together workers from approximately 30 countries and offers an unparalleled opportunity for behavioral ecologists from the United States to meet new colleagues and share their work with an international audience. The conference is organized by the International Society for Behavioral Ecology, a relatively young organization founded in 1986 that publishes the scientific journal Behavioral Ecology, now in its 14th year. The awards will specifically target younger, less established scientists lacking access to other funding sources, and thus will help to increase participation by recent Ph.D.s initiating their careers in this field. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
