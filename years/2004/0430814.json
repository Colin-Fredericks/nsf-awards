It spans the gamut from\r\nnuclear structure to astrophysics, tests of fundamental laws of nature,\r\nand myriad applications.  Nevertheless, it is characterized by several\r\nencompassing themes that reflect the major challenges facing modern\r\nscience today, and it has deep links to many other fields.\r\n\r\nThe scientifing challenges discussed at ENAM will include the\r\nfollowing compelling questions:\r\n* How are the heavy elements created and how do nuclear properties\r\n  influence the stars?\r\n* What is the structure of atomic nuclei and how do complex systems derive\r\n  their properties from their individual constituents?\r\n* How can complex many-body systems display such astonishing regularities\r\n  and which new symmetries characterize exotic nuclei?\r\n* What are the fundamental symmetries of nature?\r\n\r\nWorldwide, the study of exotic nuclei is in rapid advance. With the\r\nlarge number of radioactive ion beam facilities that are operating,\r\nunder construction, and proposed, ENAM is a unique forum to discuss the\r\nexciting developments in the field, including experimental discoveries,\r\ntheoretical modeling, technological advances, and applications. The\r\nFourth Conference will be at Callaway Gardens in Pine Mountain, Georgia\r\nUSA.  The timing of the meeting is excellent.  The recent Nuclear\r\nPhysics Long Range Plan has identified the Rare Isotope Accelerator as\r\nthe highest priority for new construction in nuclear physics for the\r\nUnited States.  For the RIA community in the USA, and for the RIB\r\ncommunity worldwide, ENAM is the single most important meeting.\r\n",
