 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to support the research and development of a multi-user virtual environment (MUVE) to support science content learning and environmental awareness among students ages nine to thirteen.  Leveraging an existing platform developed through previous National Science Foundation support and a 2000+ user-base, it will develop an educational gaming context in which children will be engaged in investigating the socio-political and environmental dynamics surrounding the creation and maintenance of a game reserve located in Tanzania.  Children learning from the Black Rhino Unit will travel around a virtual environment where they can collect environmental data and interview experts to develop an understanding of the game reserve and black rhino, learn about the reasons for the animals' near extinction, its biology, its habitat, and additionally develop an understanding of the Tanzania (climate, population, terrain, political situation, etc).  However, the primary learning goal of the Black Rhino unit goes beyond learning about the black rhino with students also having to identify an issue in their local community that they will investigate and report on.\r\n     With a fully developed online education game made possible through National Science Foundation support and expected supplemental funding, the firm, One Planet Education Network (OPEN), would have a unique and powerful online education-based 3D gaming application and product to sell or license to schools and homes online around the world.  This education game development would align with and extend the firm's current portfolio of online science curriculum programs and result in a product that could have worldwide practical impact\r\n",
