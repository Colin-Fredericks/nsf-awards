Michael Christ- University of California, Berkeley\r\n\r\nTitle: Topics in Mathematical Analysis\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nResearch will be conducted on a broad array of problems\r\nin harmonic analysis, linear and nonlinear partial differential equations,\r\nseveral complex variables, Schroedinger operators,\r\nand ordinary differential equations.\r\nIn harmonic analysis proper, the decay properties of multilinear oscillatory\r\nintegral operators will be investigated, and Lebesgue space mapping properties\r\nof generalized Radon transforms will be analyzed in terms of underlying geometry. \r\nTechniques from harmonic analysis\r\nwill be used to develop a theory of almost everywhere WKB asymptotics for solutions\r\nof ordinary differential equations depending on a parameter. \r\nIn complex analysis, compactness of the d-bar Neumann problem, the\r\nanalytic hypoellipticity of related operators, and Toeplitz operators will be investigated. \r\nThe Cauchy problem will be studied for nonlinear evolution equations, with the aim of\r\nclarifying phenomena involving instablility and growth of norms of solutions. \r\nThe spectra and generalized eigenfunctions of time-independent Schroedinger operators,\r\nin one and higher dimensions, will be investigated.\r\n\r\nThe most fundamental laws of physical science are formulated as partial differential\r\nequations. These equations are sometimes linear, and sometimes nonlinear, modeling\r\nvarious types of self-interaction. The nonlinear Schrodinger equation arises in\r\nconnection with Bose-Einstein condensates, fiber optics, and assorted other physically\r\ndifferent phenomena. Time-independent Schrodinger operators with long-range potentials\r\nmodel the quantum properties of disordered electrical media. \r\nOther sources of problems concerning differential equations are internal to mathematics,\r\nsuch as complex analysis in several variables. \r\nOne of the most basic tools for the analysis of differential equations is harmonic\r\nanalysis. This research will focus both on the use of harmonic analysis methods to\r\nfurther the understanding of the nature of solutions of differential equations,\r\nand on the development of new tools within harmonic analysis which may ultimately provide\r\nfurther insight into differential equations, as well as solving problems within harmonic\r\nanalysis itself. \r\n",
