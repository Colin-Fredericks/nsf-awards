 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scanning electron microscope system will be used to carry out a wide range of innovative research projects ranging from the understanding of nanomaterials to the fine structures inherent in biological systems. In the nanomaterials research, the instrument will be used to examine the structure of thin films and extended hierarchical structures. These studies will lead to the development of new catalysts and membranes, photovoltaic and thermoelectric devices, and in the development of lightweight composite structures. The studies will also lead to new avenues to manufacture nanostructured materials. In biology, the research will help define the fine structures of freshwater fishes, such as tail neuromasts in darters and lip-surface anatomy in suckers, in order to refine their taxonomy and systematics. This work will lead to a better understanding of freshwater fish biodiversity in North America.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed instrument acquisition will greatly improve the infrastructure for research and education at Tulane University. It will be housed in the Coordinated Instrumentation Facility (CIF) at Tulane, which is a facility that operates and maintains university-wide shared instrumentation. The instrument will be available to the entire university community and will enhance excellence in graduate and undergraduate education at Tulane.  The proposed instrument will be used in training and class demonstrations and will provide research opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students. This acquisition will play an important role in encouraging the participation of underrepresented groups in the areas of science and engineering, through such existing programs as the Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LAMP), the Tulane/Xavier combined degree program, and the Graduate Alliance Program (GAELA). In addition, this acquisition will help to attract high-quality students and faculty to Tulane University.\r\n",
