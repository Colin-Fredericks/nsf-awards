 "awd_abstract_narration": "University of Maryland Baltimore County is studying the interrelationships among gender, digital media technology usage and perceptions, self-efficacy, and career intentions.  The following nine questions are examined through a combination of individual interviews, naturalistic observation, focus groups, and surveys involving approximately 2500 middle school  (6th -8th grade)  students attending Baltimore County and Howard County Maryland Public Schools: \r\n  \r\n1.  Are there gender differences in how technology is defined? \r\n2.  Do gender differences exist in the level of usage of digital media technologies? \r\n3.  Are there gender differences in how digital media technology is used? \r\n4.  Are perceptions of digital media technology different for boys versus girls?  \r\n5.  How does use of digital media technology influence perceptions of IT? \r\n6.  How do perceptions and use affect self-efficacy in IT career intentions? \r\n7.  How do perceptions, use, and self-efficacy influence decisions related to taking elective IT courses? \r\n8.  Are gender differences in IT career intentions mediated  by digital media technology  perceptions, usage, and self-efficacy? \r\n9.  Understanding the influence of these factors, what digital media or digital  media  technology  would beeffective in positively impacting these perceptions? \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\n\r\nThe social cognitive career theory (SCCT) of Lent et al. serves as a foundation for this project.  SCCT builds upon Bandura's social learning theory, and holds that career interests develop over time, and are, in part, determined by individuals' self-efficacy and outcome expectations.  We expand SCCT by incorporating the potential mediating effects of digital media technology usage and perceptions as we suggest that they should impact self-efficacy and ultimately the relationship between gender, self-efficacy, and career outcomes.  This research will provide a better understanding of these interrelationships, drawing on a diverse research team representing computer science, gender studies, industrial engineering, information science, media, and sociology.\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes include:   (1) An understanding of the interplay between experience with and perceptions of digital media technology, students' self-efficacy, and early IT career decisions.  (2) A prototype survey tool to predict levels of interest in IT courses, programs, and, potentially, careers, based on current digital media technology use and perceptions.\r\n\r\nWhile there have been Human-Computer Interaction and sociological studies tangential to this research, the focus on relationship between technology and gender and future career decisions is innovative.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\n\r\nFindings and the resulting survey tool can provide guidelines for educators and researchers developing behavioral interventions or digital media applications of technologies that will attract both girls and boys to IT career fields.  The research addresses the under-representation of women in IT and the needs to increase interest in IT in all students, to promote computer literacy, and to increase the numbers of degrees in IT generally, by offering insight about students at the middle school level.  \r\n",
