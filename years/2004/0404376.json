 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 03-043, category NIRT. Zeolites and zeolite-like materials are crystalline oxides with uniform nanometer-scale pores; they have been commercially used with remarkable success as catalysts and separation media for the past several decades in the form of microparticles formed into pellets or granules. This research will focus on the use of zeolite nanoparticles in a thin film configuration which are very promising for a number of new applications including low dielectric constant (low-k) films that are critically needed for the future generation computer chips, and high performance polymer-zeolite nanocomposite membranes that are key to the commercialization of proton exchange membrane fuel cells. A number of long-term fundamental issues still exist, and will be addressed in this proposed project: (i) synthesis of dispersible zeolite nanoparticles with small diameter, designed pore size, cavity, composition, and organic functional groups, (ii) theoretical calculation of zeolite properties such as k, elastic modulus, and heat conductivity, and (iii) development of methodologies for incorporation of zeolite nanoparticles into high performance low-k films and fuel cell membranes. \r\n\tThe scale-down of zeolite particles from micrometer to nanometer and the addition of the designed properties to the zeolite nanoparticles will bring revolutionary solutions to many critical problems in the fields of energy, environment, and microelectronics, and will represent a paradigm shift in zeolite science and technology. Synthesis of zeolite nanoparticles with designed properties and their successful demonstration as an enabling nanotechnology will become the new frontier for zeolite science and technology. The basic sciences developed in this proposal will have far reaching implications for other technologies e.g., corrosion-resistant coatings and nanocomposite membranes for air/liquid separation that are important to pollution prevention and energy conservation. A unique team environment has been established that will help train graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in a multidisciplinary fashion. Education and training for under-represented minority undergraduate students, and outreach to K-12 school students and teachers are also an essential part of the project plan.\r\n",
