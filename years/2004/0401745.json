 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project establishes a broad-based renewable energy education and training program in collaboration with nearby four-year institutions and with two technical high schools. Educators and industry experts are developing an undergraduate certificate in renewable energy. Train the trainer workshops prepare industry experts with classroom skills to teach credit and non-credit renewable energy courses.  Two summer institutes prepare teachers to integrate renewable energy concepts into their existing science courses.  Segments of the summer institutes promote the understanding and application of renewable energy for businesses and homeowners.  Area research personnel consult on technical issues, guide the curriculum development process, and provide workshop instruction.  The eight-course certificate is adapted from the renewable energy curriculum developed by Partners in Environmental Technology Education (PETE), Advanced Technology Environmental Education Center (ATEEC) and the Department of Energy.  Four courses are offered at CCCC and four are offered at the high schools. High school students earn Tech Prep college credit eligibility for high school renewable energy courses. Module format allows multiple exit and re-entry points for trades-people with industry experience.  Renewable energy instrumentation provides hands-on real world experience for students. Internships are required. Graduates from the certificate program are ready to enter the emerging renewable energy industry in southeastern Massachusetts or complete an AS degree or AA degree that prepares them for transfer to a four year BS degree program.",
