 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal divides into three projects in the related fields of two \r\ndimensional dynamical systems and geometric group theory.  The first is a \r\ncollaboration with John Franks to study smooth group actions on surfaces.  \r\nOne goal is to understand when an action by an abelian group must have a \r\nglobal fixed point.  Another is to prove that certain lattices have \r\nessentially no non-trivial actions on the two dimensional sphere.  The \r\nsecond project is joint work with Benson Farb.  One part of this project \r\nis to study lifts of the mapping class group of a surface to the \r\ndiffeomorphism group of that surface.  The third project continues joint \r\nwork with Lee Mosher.  The action of the mapping class group on \r\nTeichmuller space is paralleled by the action of the outer automorphism \r\ngroup on Outer Space.  The goal of this collaboration is to formulate an \r\nanalogue in Outer Space of Teichmuller geodesics.\r\n\r\n     The mapping class group of a surface, the diffeomorphism group of a \r\nsurface and the outer automorphism group of the free group are related in \r\nfundamental ways.  Classification theorems for elements of the mapping \r\nclass group yield information about the algebraic properties of subgroups \r\nof the diffeomorphism group and so yield restrictions on the kinds of \r\ngroups that can act on surfaces and on the ways in which groups can act.  \r\nOne of the main motivations for studying the outer automorphism group is \r\nits very close connection to mapping class groups.  One part of the \r\nproposal focuses on finding global fixed points of actions; i.e. points \r\nthat are stationary for every diffeomorphism associated to the group.  \r\nAnother is to understand actions of the mapping class group of a surface \r\non that surface.   To understand the geometry of a group one must \r\nunderstand its geodesics; i.e. what the shortest paths are between any two \r\npoints.  The geodesics of the mapping class group have been well \r\nunderstood for some time.  A third goal of the project is to  generalize \r\nfrom what is known about the geodesics of the mapping class group to \r\nidentify and study geodesics for the outer automorphism group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
