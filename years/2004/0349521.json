 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Carl Pollard will\r\nconduct two years of research on the specification and implementation\r\nof Higher Order Grammar (HOG), a new formal framework for theoretical\r\nand computational linguistics intended as a successor to Head-Driven\r\nPhrase Structure Grammar (HPSG). The research is also expected\r\nto have significant consequences for other formal linguistic\r\nframeworks such as lexical-functional grammar (LFG), type-logical\r\ngrammar (TLG), and possible-worlds semantics. HPSG, developed by\r\nPollard and others in the 1980's and 1990's, is still one of the most\r\nwidely employed formal linguistic framweworks, but has many\r\nundesirable features that arise from its highly nonstandard and\r\nidiosyncratic mathematical foundations, which make it unnecessarily\r\ndifficult for nonspecialists to learn and use, and which create a\r\nbarrier to collaboration with colleagues in adjacent disciplines\r\n(especially mathematics, logic, and computer science). While\r\npreserving the underlying model-theoretic (or constraint-based)\r\napproach characteristic of HPSG, HOG seeks to eliminate these problems by shifting to more established and better understood mathematical\r\nfoundations, namely intuitionistic propositional logic (IPL) and its\r\nassociated proof theory.\r\n\r\nOf particular interest in connection with meaning is the fact that the\r\nnotion of POSSIBLE WORLD is definable in the HOL, enabling\r\npropositions to be treated as primitives and worlds as defined (the\r\nreverse of the situation in the standard Carnap-Kripke-Montague\r\ntradition); this setup gives us all the worlds we need (but no\r\nimpossible worlds), while at the same time leading to novel and\r\nsurprisingly simple solutions of longstanding semantic conundrums\r\nfamiliar to philosophical logicians (such as the logical omniscience\r\n(or granularity) problem and the Hesperus-Phosphorus problem). Attention will also be given to the syntax-phonology interface, working from the hypothesis that phonological interpretation can be treated as\r\nformally on a par with semantic interpretation (in terms of categorical\r\nlogic,the syntax-semantics and syntax-phonology interfaces are both\r\npartial logical endofunctors).\r\n\r\n",
