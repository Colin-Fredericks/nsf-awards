 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY\r\nPage A\r\nMany hypotheses have been proposed for the response of the land plants, insects, and\r\nvertebrates to the P/Tr boundary extinction event. Many of these hypotheses are based on\r\npoorly unconstrained spatial and/or temporal data. Most lack any contextual constraint\r\nof the paleontological data used in the analysis used to support the interpretation.\r\nHence, it is not possible to know if the ?trends? or ?changes? seen to occur from the\r\npreboundary assemblages into the transitional and post-boundary assemblages are a true\r\nreflection of the ecosystem or are biased taphonomically.\r\nThis proposal hypothesizes that an isotaphonomic data set of pre-boundary,\r\ntrans-boundary, and post-boundary plant-fossil assemblages will allow for the emergence of\r\na credible characterization of the response within this part of the terrestrial ecosystem\r\nat this critical point in Earth history. Will the isotaphonomic plant-fossil record\r\nparallel or be tangential to the well established response in the marine realm? Or, will\r\nthere be no change in biodiversity; might the replacement and/or turnover occur earlier or\r\nlater in time than directly at the P/Tr boundary?\r\nResearch conducted, to date, in KwaZulu Natal Province, South Africa, in the northeastern\r\npart of the Karoo Basin indicates that Late Permian megafloral assemblages are preserved\r\nin four different sedimentologic and taphonomic conditions. Each megafloral assemblage\r\ntype preserves a very different signature of the vegetation contributed to the fossil\r\nrecord. These are: (1) parautochthonous assemblages within abandoned fluvial channel fill\r\nsequences, similar to modern and other ancient oxbow lakes; (2) dispersed and isolated,\r\nallochthonous assemblages preserved on foreset beds and reactivation surfaces within\r\nlarge, fine-grained fluvial regimes; (3) concentrated, mat-like allochthonous assemblages\r\nwithin bedload dunes of coarse siltstone channels; and (4) dispersed, sorted assemblages\r\nin turbidites. Data presented in the text concerning two localities ? Bulwer and\r\nWagendrift Dam ? demonstrate that previous interpretations of the fossil assemblages in\r\nthese sites are incorrect. And if these data are used from the literature as the basis\r\nfor interpretation, the resulting suppositions are inappropriate.\r\nWith an increasing continentalization of the sedimentary package in the Karoo into the\r\nTriassic, all but the last taphonomic assemblage type should be encountered in the\r\ntransitional and post-boundary sections. Seven cross boundary and post boundary sections\r\nhave been identified in which plant fossils and/or vertebrates are preserved, and will\r\nserve as the basis for the 2004 field season. It is anticipated that identification of\r\nisotaphonomic assemblages in this part of the stratigraphy will allow for direct\r\ncomparison of biodiversity indices with those presently being determined by other members\r\nof an international research team, involving U.S., Dutch, and South African scientists.\r\nThe present proposal requests funds to support undergraduate student research designed to\r\nassist in the acquisition of an isotaphonomic data set in the Karoo Basin, South Africa.\r\nThrough the next two years of field work and laboratory analysis, P/Tr and early to middle\r\nTriassic localities will be assessed to identify and characterize those depositional\r\nsequences as found in the latest Permian.",
