Stoffel will organize a series of after-school science clubs in eight middle schools in demographically diverse Western Washington. She will also recruit and train pre-service teachers and chemistry majors to lead these science clubs. This Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\nThe Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service.  Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need.  Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation.  The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.\r\n",
