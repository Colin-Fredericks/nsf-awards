 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Rajendra Rathore of the Department of Chemistry at Marquette University is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program to perform research that integrates the disciplines of synthetic organic chemistry, molecular recognition, and material science with the aim of studying and exploiting new cofacially-stacked benzenoid structures that can be potentially utilized for the development of various electronic and optoelectronic devices in the emerging field of nanotechnology. In his proposal, he has outlined the design and synthesis of a variety of new cofacially-stacked benzenoid structures bearing multiple redox-active chromophores for the preparation of (advanced) nanomaterials for practical usage. Some of the examples include: suitably tailored redox-active polyaromatic hydrocarbons for self assembly, cofacially-stacked (poly)stilbenoid hydrocarbons, and (poly)fluorene derivatives for the preparation of wire-like materials. He will demonstrate the functioning of various covalently linked polychromophoric molecules with cofacially-stacked benzenoid spacers for the potential utilization for the design and construction of molecular wires that will find widespread applications in the area of molecular electronics.  The study of the proposed novel molecules, using various spectroscopic techniques including time-resolved spectroscopy, will expand the understanding of the nature of through-space and through-bond electronic interactions between various organic redox centers linked via cofacially-stacked benzenoid spacers.  \r\n\r\nWith the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Rathore will design and synthesize new cofacially-stacked benzenoid structures. This is an important step that will allow the development of a variety of new molecular and supramolecular nanostructures in order to achieve photoinduced charge separation over long distances and with high quantum efficiency. His work will create exciting challenges for future research. Moreover, these fundamental studies of the electron transport through cofacially-stacked p-systems will also be highly relevant to the understanding of the (controversial) electron-transport phenomenon observed in DNA through p-stacked bases. Ultimately, the easy fabrication of organic molecules and the high degree of synthetic flexibility in the preparation of these molecular assemblies will allow their ready modification and eventual incorporation into polymers and thin films for potential practical applications in the field of nanotechnology. Finally, the research proposed herein will also promote multidisciplinary research programs that offer high quality training and research facilities for both undergraduate and graduate students within the university.\r\n",
