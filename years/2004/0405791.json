 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Principle Investigator proposes to continue his research program \r\non efficient estimation in semiparametric models with an emphasis \r\non non- and semiparametric regression models, on bivariate models with \r\npartial knowledge about the marginals, and on time series models.\r\nSpecial attention will be paid to the possibility of \r\n(efficient) root-n consistent estimation \r\nof curves such as stationary densities and conditional expectations in \r\ntime series models with independent innovations.  \r\nWork on regression models will focus on diagnostics and \r\non imputing when responses are missing at random.\r\nIn connection with the latter fully imputed estimators will be studied.\r\nSuch estimators impute not only the missing but also the observed responses.\r\nCurrent work by the Principal Investigator suggests that the \r\nfully imputed estimator is typically better than the partly imputed estimator, \r\nwhich only imputes the missing responses. \r\nOne goal of the research is to prove this conjecture and \r\nto show that fully imputed estimators can even be made to be efficient. \r\nThe work on bivariate models will deal with \r\nfine-tuning results for known and equal marginals obtained so far,\r\nand on extending such results to more general models \r\nincluding those in which the marginal distributions are \r\nlinked through a parameter. \r\nWork on two monographs, one on efficient estimation in regression models\r\nand the other on efficient estimation in time series models, is also planned.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will advance the theory of efficient estimation in \r\nsemiparametric models and will provide more efficient ways of analyzing \r\ndata in many concrete problems.  Since semiparametric models are \r\nwidespread in many fields that use statistics, the proposed research will \r\nhave an impact on all these fields.  For example, results on time series \r\nand Markov chain models have applications in econometrics and mathematical \r\nfinance; results on bivariate models have applications in actuarial sciences \r\nand in medical research; results on imputing are useful in medical studies.\r\nThe planned monographs are intended to disseminate some of the research \r\nfrom the proposed research to a wider audience.\r\n",
