 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will study the physics of plasma injections into the inner magnetosphere during magnetospheric substorms and storms.  The project will use a newly coupled model consisting of the UCLA global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model and the Rice Convection Model (RCM).  The coupled model will eliminate the shortcomings that are currently inherent to the models: the lack of a ring current and correct particle drift physics in the MHD code, and the dependence of the RCM on empirical submodels and ad hoc assumptions.  The coupling process will be done by using a novel data structure to exchange information between the models at certain times during the calculation, allowing the models to run in parallel, and not necessarily on the same computer.  The data exchange will be in the form of a protocol, similar to the protocols that are used on the World Wide Web, which will allow for maximum flexibility, extensibility and openness.  Coupling of the models will proceed in six stages of increasing complexity.  As each coupling stage is completed the investigators will model a set of selected substorm and storm events and perform comprehensive comparisons with in situ observations.  The comparisons will yield information about the relative importance of different processes.  The goal is to develop a global magnetosphere model with much improved capabilities compared to contemporary models, and a much more thorough understanding of substorm and storm time injections.",
