 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Scholarships (CSEMS) project aims to continue helping financially needy computer science, engineering, and mathematics students to obtain their baccalaureate degrees. It provides a total of 30 scholarships to 20 undergraduate and 10 graduate students within the CSEM disciplines.   \r\n \r\nThe objectives of this project include: \r\n1.  Recruit, identify, select and evaluate potential students entering CSEM fields. \r\n2.  Provide adequate services so that CSEMS students maintain satisfactory academic progress. \r\n3.  Provide adequate support, financially and otherwise, to CSEMS scholars so they may complete their educational goals. \r\n4.  Connect participants with their faculty advisors \r\n5.  Encourage undergraduate students to experience research either at UNM, other universities or to experience internships at private and governmental research institutions.  \r\n \r\nStudents are selected on the basis of financial need, academic merit, and potential for professional success.  The program utilizes UNM financial aid office procedures and regulations to establish financial need of students. Academic merit is determined by students' grade point average, the quality of the recommendation letters, the students' resume, and the goal setting essay submitted by every applicant. A committee reviews applications.   Tutoring, mentoring, and professional development are an integral part of the program since these services foster students' growth and interest in their field of study. Students are referred to the UNM Career Services office for career placement.   \r\n \r\nThe broader impact of this project is that it provides opportunities for students, especially minority students, to succeed in the CSEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is in the strength of the CSEM academic programs, the close interaction between students and faculty in the CSEM fields, and the ability of graduates to obtain good jobs in the CSEM fields.",
