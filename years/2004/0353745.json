 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Molecular Physics Laboratory (MPL) of SRI International continues to host a site for the National Science Foundation's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program.  The MPL has a worldwide reputation for its fundamental and applied research in atomic, molecular, and laser physics. During the past 11 years, 106 undergraduate students have participated in MPL's REU program, collaborating with Ph.D. mentors from the MPL staff on a wide variety of experimental and theoretical research problems in these areas. \r\n\r\nThe program recruits highly qualified undergraduate students; helps them identify the best match of student, mentor, and research project; and strives to provide a rewarding summer research experience. MPL staff provide each student with both formal and informal opportunities to perform exciting research, discuss their work, present project results, and explore career possibilities in science. We expect this REU program to continue to produce student/mentor co-authored presentations and publications, undergraduate students who have a better sense of the work of Ph.D. scientists at a research institute, and our research staff renewed by the energy and fresh perspective of young scientists.\r\n",
