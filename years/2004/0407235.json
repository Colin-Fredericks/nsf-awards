Ozisik, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute\r\n\r\nThe Division of Polymer Chemistry of the American Chemical Society is sponsoring a meeting entitled Molecular Modeling of Macromolecules in Hilton Head Island, SC, on March 17-20, 2004.  Prof. Rahmi Ozisik of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Prof. Gregory Rutledge of Massachusetts Institute of Technology are organizing the workshop, which is the third in a series of highly successful events that brings together leading scientists from the U.S. and abroad for a serious exchange of ideas concerning the specialized area of modeling of macromolecules including both synthetic polymers and biomaterials  (proteins).  The international program will feature 45-minute talks addressing many aspects of the modeling of materials such as nanocomposites, biomaterials, multiscale modeling, and thin films and glass transition temperature.  The program will begin on Wednesday evening with an opening reception and a plenary overview lecture, followed by two and a half days of invited lectures.  The conference will also feature an extensive poster session on Thursday evening, which will permit even more individuals to present their latest research and stimulate further interactions between the academic and industrial participants.  There will be opportunity for the attendees to use commercial modeling software.  With 15 invited speakers and 60-100 registrants expected, this workshop represents an important and timely effort to address needs for continuing education geared towards the scientific and technical community involved in or interested in learning about the state of the art in modeling of macromolecular systems.  The web site of the workshop is at the following addresses: \r\nhttp://www.polyacs.org/ http://www.polyacs.org/arcmeetings/molecularmodeling.404.shtml \r\n\r\nThe format of the workshop is similar to that of the Gordon Research Conferences, with morning and evening technical sessions, afternoon informal discussions and poster session, and common meals.   Attendance is open to the community, and participants are encouraged to contribute through discussion and poster presentations.  All 15 invited speakers are leaders in their fields.  Majority of the speakers are from academia and two of these speakers are from France and Greece.  In addition, one speaker is from the Air Force Research Laboratory and one speaker is from the industry (DuPont).  Students and post-doctoral researchers are particularly encouraged to attend, as this will give them an opportunity to meet the leading scientists in the field and establish relationships that they can use in their future career.  The participants will also be able to present their work through a poster session, which will enable further discussions between the speakers and the students and junior faculty/researchers.   The workshop is open to all individuals and every effort is made to accommodate persons with disabilities. \r\n\r\n",
