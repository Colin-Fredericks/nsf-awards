Another goal is to study the existence,\r\nuniqueness, and stability of solutions (like strong detonations)\r\nto the Chapman-Jouget and ZND models of combustion, and to clarify\r\nwhen and how well solutions to these simplified models approximate\r\ntrue exact solutions of the full Navier-Stokes-combustion system.\r\nThe proposed research will also examine the neutral stability\r\nregime for both shocks and vortex sheets, and in particular will\r\nattempt to provide a rigorous foundation for the theory of Artola\r\nand Majda which describes the development of kink modes leading to\r\nroll-up in supersonic vortex sheets.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposer intends to carry out a rigorous investigation of the\r\nexistence and nonlinear stability of certain important\r\nmultidimensional structures arising in the mathematical study of\r\ncompressible fluids.  These structures include shock waves,\r\ndetonation fronts, and vortex sheets.  There is a vast applied\r\nliterature on these topics, but until relatively recently they\r\nhave resisted rigorous mathematical analysis, particularly in the\r\nmultidimensional case.  In recent work by the proposer, his\r\ncollaborators, and others new tools have become available that\r\npermit a rigorous study of the highly singular perturbation\r\nproblems that arise in investigating the stability of such\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
