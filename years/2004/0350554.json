 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit. Funding is requested to continue community structure and\r\nbiogeographic analysis of organisms associated with hydrothermal vents. Work\r\ncompleted to date has led to the acquisition of a unique, quantitative assessment of\r\ndiversity and faunal similarities and differences among vent and seep mussel beds from\r\nvent sites along the East Pacific Rise and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and seep sites in the\r\nAtlantic and Gulf of Mexico. These samples provide a rich context within which to\r\ninterpret the faunal composition and structure in mussel beds in an area south of the\r\nEaster Microplate (38S) and in the Lau and Fiji back-arc basins. Specimens will be\r\ncollected using our standard gear from two discrete mussel beds at each of the 3 primary\r\nsites. Once collected, samples will be processed using the standard protocol established\r\nin our lab, and identified with the help of the extensive voucher collection maintained at\r\nThe College of William & Mary, and with the aid of taxonomic specialists as necessary.\r\nA subset of appropriately preserved sorted samples will be made available for molecular\r\nanalyses, which will be undertaken in collaboration with R. Vrijenhoek. Molecular\r\nanalyses will focus on taxa where there is a need to test for cryptic species or phenotypic\r\nplasticity and selected other taxa of interest to Vrijenhoek and Van Dover, in addition to\r\nthe suite of taxa that Vrijenhoek is separately funded to analyze (primarily tubeworms,\r\nmussels, crabs, clams). The proposed community structure and faunistic analyses will\r\ncontribute to our understanding of the degree of evolutionary alliance of vent faunas\r\nwithin the Pacific Ocean basin and to potential barriers or conduits to dispersal. The\r\nwork is of particular interest because the study sites have been strategically chosen to\r\naddress biogeographic issues relating to the degree of isolation of adjacent back-arc basin\r\nsystems, the relationship of these back-arc faunas to the most-southern-known vent\r\nfaunas on the mid-ocean ridge (at 38S), and the relationships among these faunas and\r\nsites already studied north of the Easter Microplate on the East Pacific Rise.\r\nBroader Impact. Numerous undergraduates and graduate students will benefit from\r\nparticipation in field programs and analysis of samples. Aspects of the research are\r\nincorporated into the PIs undergraduate and graduate teaching. Results will be published\r\nin the professional literature and will be made available to the public through web-based\r\nresources and through public lectures by the PI and her students.\r\n\r\n",
