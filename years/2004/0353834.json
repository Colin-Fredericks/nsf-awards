This award provides support for an REU Site at the University of Tennessee Knoxville (UTK). Nine students will be recruited from throughout the U.S. for a ten-week summer experience in research related to wireless biosensors. Students will have an opportunity to engage in research projects in the interdisciplinary field of wireless biosensor technology as a part of research collaborations established between the UTK and Oak Ridge National Laboratories. The program will help students recognize their academic potential and encourage them to attend graduate school in order to be poised to take advantage of career opportunities in research. It is anticipated that this program will have a Broader Impact on the nations need to increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents engaged in research-related careers at U.S. universities, government agencies, and private-sector organizations.",
