 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Christian Wolf of the Department of Chemistry at Georgetown University is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program for his research on developing molecular sensors exhibiting a C2-symmetric 1,8-dihetarylnaphthalene framework for stereoselective recognition of organic compounds. He will prepare and employ stereodynamic 1,8-diquinolylnaphthalenes and conformationally stable 1,8-diacridylnaphthalenes in stereoselective sensing studies and investigate the chiral recognition mechanism. In pursuing new directions toward static and dynamic sensors that utilize fluorescence or induced circular dichroism, this study is expected to significantly advance the current scope of stereoselective sensing of fine chemicals.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program in the Chemistry Division, Dr Wolf is increasing participation and involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in chemical sciences through the integration of discovery and learning. Selected research projects mentored by Ph.D. students provide undergraduate students with hands-on research experience while graduate students gain important teamwork and training skills. The introduction of computer-based learning exercises and research activities into an undergraduate laboratory course is exposing students to the excitement of discovery at an early stage in their careers. A new initiative at the graduate level is aimed at helping Ph.D. students in identifying career opportunities in chemical sciences prior to graduation.\r\n",
