 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Coppin State College Stem Project (C-STEM) under the NSF Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), is to broaden minority participation in the national STEM workforce by recruiting, retaining and graduating increased numbers of STEM students who are prepared for entry into graduate programs and employment in STEM fields. This will be accomplished through the implementation of prescriptive objectives and strategies in faculty and curriculum development and through student outreach and support in mathematics and the sciences and technologies.  Project goals include: 1) enrolling 300 freshman students interested in STEM; 2) increasing the number of STEM entering freshman students with high SAT scores; 3) increasing pass rates by 50% over five years in bottleneck courses; 4) increasing retention rates of STEM students to 60%; 5) increasing the number of STEM graduates from 43 to 150 over the five year project period; 6) increasing the number of STEM graduates admitted to graduate programs; and 7) conducting an ongoing evaluation of the C-STEM Program.   \r\n\r\nFour major strategies will be implemented in order to meet the project goals include: 1) enhancing, developing, and implementing STEM curricular offerings utilizing pedagogy that is effective with disadvantaged and minority students; 2) developing and implementing an aggressive college and community outreach effort to recruit students into STEM programs and increasing student support services to increase retention and graduation rates; 3) integrating research-based teaching and internships throughout the STEM Program, using the successful McNair Post Baccalaureate Achievement Program at Coppin, and through partnerships with educational and research institutions; and 4) implementing a plan for continuing faculty development. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the C-STEM activities includes advancing knowledge regarding curricular, instructional and support strategies effective with minority and/or disadvantaged undergraduate populations, and measurable strategies that improve matriculation, retention and graduation. \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the C-STEM project activities includes higher graduation and employment in STEM fields of the target population.  C-STEM will integrate research and education by infusing learning with discovery, and integrate diversity into faculty and curriculum development, student outreach, and support activities.  \r\n",
