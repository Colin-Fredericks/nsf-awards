 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support for the International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE) International Symposium on Fluctuations and Noise, to be held at Maspalomas,  Gran Canaria Island, Spain, May 26-28, 2004. The Conference Chairwoman is Professor Dragana Popovic, Florida State University. This is only the second conference of its type, which addresses the study of materials by noise and stochastic techniques. Areas of interest include noise as a probe of glass transitions and glassy states, noise in metal-insulator transitions, shot noise as a probe of conduction mechanisms, and noise in domain dynamics, Barkhausen noise.  A session on soft materials will also be included. The European venue ensures strong participation by European scientists who have been leaders in this emerging research field. The NSF support will assist the attendance of approximately 10 graduate students, postdocs, or junior faculty. Participation in the Conference will expose these young scientists to unique information and techniques that allow the dynamics of materials, particularly strongly correlated electron materials to be characterized.",
