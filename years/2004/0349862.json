Mayer\r\n\r\nThe Department of Mathematics of the University of Alabama at\r\nBirmingham proposes to host the Spring Topology and Dynamical\r\nSystems Conference (STDC), March 25-27, 2004.  The STDC\r\nencompasses most of the areas of topology and of topological\r\napproaches to dynamical systems.  We expect the conference to\r\nattract over 200 participants, nationally and internationally.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed activity lies in the broad\r\nand deep interaction among the participants.  To ensure strong\r\nand balanced representation in each of the areas central to the\r\nconference, we propose to have four special sessions running in\r\nparallel: Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, General and\r\nSet-Theoretic Topology, and Geometric Topology.  To promote unity\r\nand interaction, there will be 12 invited talks of 25-minutes in\r\ntwo parallel sessions, and 7 plenary talks of 50 minutes. Ample\r\nopportunities for formal and informal interaction among\r\nparticipants will be provided.  This will include a session\r\ndevoted to the state of the arts in the conference areas, current\r\nfruitful directions, and new opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe STDC conference brings together mathematicians and\r\nmathematics students working in two core areas of mathematics:\r\ntopology and dynamical systems.  The broader impact of the\r\nproposed activity lies in the advancement of knowledge, including\r\neducation of students, through communication of recent results in\r\nthese two core areas.  We expect that many of the invited talks\r\nwill emphasize interaction of the research agendas of the central\r\nconference areas.  Successful conferences in core areas are an\r\nimportant part of mathematical infrastructure, supporting\r\nresearch, training new mathematicians, and developing a\r\nfoundation for applications in related fields of mathematics and\r\nscience. Every effort will be made to provide for the substantial\r\nparticipation of under-represented groups, graduate students, and\r\nactive researchers in these areas.\r\n\r\n",
