 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the workshop is to bring together\r\nthe leaders of the fields of knot theory and 3-manifold topology to\r\ndiscuss the state of the art of the subjects (currently in a state of\r\nrapid change).  A second purpose is to introduce young mathematicians,\r\ngraduate students and postdoctoral fellows to the subjects. The workshop\r\nwill begin with minicourses followed by individual lectures on the later\r\ndays.\r\n    The mathematical theory of knots is currently a very active area of\r\nmathematics.  Knot theory has found application in molecular biology, for\r\nexample in testing models of the action of certain recombination enzymes\r\non DNA.  The study of knotted orbits gives a powerful tool in the theory\r\nof 3-dimensional dynamics.  Knot theory is connected intimately with\r\nquestions such as \"what is the shape of our universe?\"  Our space, which\r\nappears 3-dimensional and flat (or 4-dimensional with time) may be curved\r\nin on itself and form what is known as a closed 3-manifold.  The deep\r\nconnection between the theory of 3-manifolds (and 4-manifolds) with knot\r\ntheory is the special focus of this workshop.  It is timely, as many\r\nlong-standing problems in the subjects have recently been solved, giving\r\nrise (of course) to new and deeper problems.\r\n",
