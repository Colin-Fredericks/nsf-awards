 "awd_abstract_narration": "RNA viruses include significant pathogens of plants and animals.  Pathogenesis of these viruses requires the replication of the viral genome, which is predicated upon specific recognition of portions of the viral RNA (RNA promoters) and the multi-subunit enzyme complex, the replicase. Analysis of the specificity in this interaction would benefit tremendously from knowledge of the structures of the RNA motifs and the protein enzymes.  While the structures of a number of viral replication proteins have been solved, knowledge of the viral RNA promoters is limited.  In fact, the high-resolution structure of only one RNA promoter has been reported.  This research focuses on the structure and function of RNA promoters of Brome mosaic virus (BMV), with the goal of solving the high-resolution structures of all of the promoters. Furthermore, the structure of a promoter from Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) will be solved to allow comparison of the recognition motifs used by two related RNA viruses.  Effort will also be made to identify additional RNA sequences/structures that bind to the BMV replicase.  Anticipated results from this research will deepen our basic understanding of RNA-dependent RNA synthesis and will identify novel targets that can be manipulated to limit viral infections. This research is a collaboration between researchers at California State University at Hayward, an undergraduate and masters institution, and Texas A&M University.  At CSU-Hayward, a talented team of undergraduates and masters students will participate in the research and thus learn concepts and techniques at the interface of biology and structural studies.  \r\n\r\nA more thorough understanding of the replication of RNA plant viruses will not only add to our basic knowledge of nature but also help us devise ways to control plant diseases.\r\n\r\n",
