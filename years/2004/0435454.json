 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: \r\n\r\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) will benefit society by accelerating scientific research, increasing productivity, and enhancing security. Candidate solutions to particular scientific challenges, ranging from device design to distributed algorithms, exist with various assumed requirements, constraints, and relationships between the components. However, there is no consensus on an overall sensor network architecture.  Deployments take a narrow vertical slice to achieve a operational network.  The objective of this project is to formulate and evaluate a comprehensive WSN systems architecture, encompassing general design principles, broad functional decompositions, and detailed interfaces by which pieces fit together.  \r\nThe approach recognizes that the ``narrow waist\" of this architecture -- playing the role of IP in the Internet architecture -- is a best-effort single-hop broadcast.  The primary method for articulating the essential abstractions is iterative cycles of (candidate collection, design, integration, evaluation) with the outcome presented to the community for analysis to establish the right compromises between generality and performance.  This process will articulate consistent programming interfaces that encompass collection, aggregation, dissemination, neighborhoods, data centric storage, and attribute-based routing over multiple link layers.  The architecture will be tested on cross-cutting aspects of efficiency, coordination, power, management, and security.  It should embrace heterogeneity and allow for application-specific optimization within a consistent framework.  \r\nCreating a successful architecture for WSNs will reduce development effort, allow greater synergy and interoperability, enable more rapid innovation, and greatly broaden the sphere of applications from national security to scientific research and ecosystem management. \r\n\r\n",
