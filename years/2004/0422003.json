 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project creates a merit-based scholarship program for talented but financially needy students in computer science and mathematics. These scholarships will be known as the NSF - John von Neumann Scholarships. Each year the project awards twenty scholarships to beginning students, fifteen scholarships to advanced students, and one scholarship to a graduate student. These scholarships increase the numbers of students who excel in beginning courses, increase the amount of time students can spend each week on their study, reduce the number of students who suspend their education for financial reasons, and retain more students to graduation. Ultimately the project increases the number of students graduating in four years in computer science and mathematics. The project includes a learning community for incoming freshmen, faculty mentors for scholarship recipients, tutors in computer science and mathematics, and career placement services on graduation. The intellectual merit of the project lies in giving students more time for academics, improving mentoring and support services, and encouraging creative work. The broader impacts of the project lies in project broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in computer science and mathematics by improving their access to higher education.",
