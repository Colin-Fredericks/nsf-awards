Leading scientists and researchers from the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, and Asia will be participating in this workshop. The objectives of this workshop are to assess the state of practice and research priorities in the area of geopolymers and geopolymer concrete; to provide researchers, engineers and scientists the opportunity to interact and develop a cooperation network; to identify major barriers to the effective utilization of geopolymers and geopolymer concrete in the engineering field; and to prioritize and document the needs for effective research policies and programs. Particular attention will be given to the identification of research projects of mutual interest to participating researchers and countries. Ten researchers and scientists from the US will be invited to participate and contribute to this workshop. The general theme of the workshop will be the Utilization and Manufacture of Geopolymers and Geopolymer Concrete for a Sustainable Development of\r\nInfrastructures for the Community. Specific topics to be covered include: Mixture Proportions, Waste Utilization, Short-term and Long-term Properties, Effect of Exposure to Adverse Environment, Chemistry of Geopolymers, Rheology of Mixtures, Behavior and Strength of Structural Elements and Non-structural Applications.\r\n\r\n",
