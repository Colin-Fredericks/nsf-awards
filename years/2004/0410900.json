 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discipline: Interdisciplinary (99)\r\n\r\nThis project is integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology into five (5) courses of study (business, criminal justice/security, fire science, nursing, and public health) in the College of Professional Studies, as a means of facilitating the improvement of critical thinking, quantitative reasoning, and technological competencies across the curriculum at New Jersey City University, a Hispanic-Serving Institution in the heart of the New York City metropolitan area.  Five new, 1-credit, discipline-specific exercise modules are being developed to augment a current 3-credit core course, creating a single 4-credit (3+1) sequence that will serve all five degree programs.  The discipline-specific exercises originate from GIS courses taught by disciplinary experts, and are being adapted and implemented to fit the economic climate, demographic distribution, and urban environment of northern New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this activity is in marrying the strengths of generalist and specialist approaches to GIS training by integrating exciting, relevant exercises into an introductory course.  Students immediately see relevance in these exercises and take ownership of their learning experience.  This produces high motivation, which results in improved persistence and retention.  The increased motivation and self-esteem that result from surmounting GIS-related challenges are reflected in improved competency in other areas, especially technology, critical thinking and quantitative reasoning.  Improved competency in these areas is being identified and measured with NJCU rubrics derived from national models. The broader impacts of this project are that improvements in core competencies, coupled with improved motivation, retention, and persistence to graduation, enable NJCU students, many of them members of under-represented minorities, to compete successfully in the 21st century workforce.\r\n",
