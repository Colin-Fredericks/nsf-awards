 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 19th North American Meeting of the Catalysis Society will be held May 21-28, 2005 in Philadelphia. These meetings of the Catalysis Society are held biannually and are recognized as premier events for catalysis researchers in North America and throughout the world.  Symposium topics will include recent advances in many areas of catalysis such as: petroleum, environmental, chemical, fuel cells and fuel processing, and emerging catalytic technology.   Keynote speakers will provide overviews in these areas.  The objective of this proposal is to maximize meeting attendance by graduate students by defraying the costs of participation.  With co-funding from other sources, support for about 80 students will be provided.  The overall technical impact of the Catalysis Society meetings is high due to the wide interest in current topics in catalysis and reaction engineering. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the conference include the exchange of scientific information among the 800-1000 faculty, governmental laboratory scientists, postdoctoral students, and graduate students who are expected to attend.  This grant will enable a diverse group of students to attend, including women and minorities from varied geographical locations in the United States.   The poster presentations (over 300) and informal interactions permit students to gain a much broader perspective of catalysis research.    Career development of these young investigators will be significantly enhanced by participation in the meeting.  \r\n",
