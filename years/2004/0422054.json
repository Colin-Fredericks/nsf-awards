 "awd_abstract_narration": "Each year, for four years, this project provides scholarships to 25 academically talented, financially needy, Bennett College students majoring in CSEM disciplines. Scholarship recipients should either receive a baccalaureate degree in mathematics or computer science in four years, or transfer after 3 years to an engineering school to earn an engineering degree within 2 years. Recruitment, retention and academic support are critical components of this project. In conjunction with Bennett College's Office of Enrollment Services, an aggressive recruitment campaign is used to attract CSEM majors to Bennett College.  For retention, Bennett College provides a quality curriculum, excellent teaching, mentoring, academic enrichment experiences, and exceptional academic support. Bennett College works closely with their Center for Teaching, Learning, and Technology (CTLT) to ensure that students are provided necessary counseling, tutoring, and skills building sessions. Bennett College also collaborates with academic and industry partners on cutting-edge curriculum enhancements, career planning and placement, and student internship opportunities. \r\nIntellectual Merit Statement: Infrastructure enhancements for research and education are realized through the industry and academic partnerships.  In addition to career planning and curriculum review, the industry partnerships lead to future support through scholarships, internships, recruitment and capital campaign involvement. \r\nBroader Impacts Statement: PASS scholarship recipients are Bennett College students, mostly African American women from across the USA. The participation of underrepresented groups is broadened in terms of gender, ethnicity, and geography.   Societal benefits include the production of highly qualified high tech professionals and leaders; and, through the inclusion of minorities and women, a more diverse and nationally representative workforce.  \r\n",
