 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tight contact structures are closely related to the topology of the\r\nunderlying 3-manifold.  They provide bounds on the genus of the surface\r\nrepresenting a homology class, are related to taut foliations on\r\n3-manifolds and to the topology of symplectic 4-manifolds, to\r\nSeiberg-Witten theory and Floer homology. Matic proposes to further\r\nanalyze contact manifolds using cut-and-paste techniques developed in\r\ncollaboration with Honda and Kazez.  The main part of cut-and-paste\r\ncontact topology are gluing theorems.  Matic proposes to keep studying\r\nthe gluing techniques and to apply them to various open questions, like\r\nthe existence of tight contact structures on Haken homology spheres.\r\nHere the techniques from foliation theory fall short.  There are in\r\nfact recent examples of Haken homology spheres that do not carry taut\r\nfoliations.  As a result of her investigations she hopes to be able to\r\nbetter understand a basic question: what information about the topology\r\nof the 3-manifold can we get from existence of a tight contact\r\nstructure.\r\n\tThree-dimensional manifolds are modeled on the three dimensional space\r\nwe live in.  Questions in symplectic and contact geometry were\r\noriginally motivated by dynamical questions in physics and contact\r\nstructures arise naturally in hydrodynamics.  The proposed research has\r\nthe potential to produce new results applicable to these questions.\r\n",
