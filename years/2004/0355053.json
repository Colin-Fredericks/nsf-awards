 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ocean.US was created by the National Oceanographic Partnership Program in late 2000 as a National Office to promote and facilitate the establishment of an integrated and sustained ocean observing system. \r\nIn March 2002, a planning workshop was held to create a design and implementation plan for an integrated and sustained observing system for the United States. Some 110 attendees participated in discussions, the results of which are summarized in the report titled \" An Integrated and Sustained Ocean Observing System (IOOS) for the United States: Design and Implementation\" (Ocean.US, 2002). \r\n\r\nThe PI has played an important role in coordinating these community-planning efforts. His continued participation in the Ocean.US activities will provide the continuity necessary to keep the initiative moving forward. \r\n\r\nThe main effort in the coming year will be to provide representation at Ocean.US to ensure that basic research remains an important element of the integrated ocean observing system implementation planning process;fFunction as liaison between IOOS and the new OOI Project Office; act as an interface between federal planning and the academic and user communities; stay abreast of the DAC activities at Ocean.US; continue to interact with scientists active in the forming of the regional associations; explore issues associated with the transition of techniques and technology from research to operations; continue working on the development of an implantation plan for HF Radar for measuring surface currents in US Coastal waters; and keep abreast of current and emerging biological and chemical technology for Observing Systems.\r\n\r\n",
