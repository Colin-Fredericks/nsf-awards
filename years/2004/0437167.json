The main focus is\r\nanalysis of data with nonignorable nonresponse, using\r\nstructural equation models and methods that take into account the\r\nmissing data mechanism. The investigators study and develop (1)\r\nselection and pattern mixture model approaches to jointly model\r\nthe missing data mechanism and the variation in the observed data,\r\n(2) methods to segment the data into groups having the same\r\nmissing data mechanism via development of statistical tests of \r\nhomogeneity of mean and covariances, utilization of clustering \r\nmethods as well as latent variable regression models, (3) multiple \r\nimputation methods that use predictive models for nonignorable \r\nnonresponse data to impute missing data, and (4) application of \r\nvarious types of bootstrap methods that take into account missing-\r\nness. The investigators develop theoretically sound statistical methods, \r\ntheories are assessed by extensive simulation studies, and methods \r\nare examined by application to real data, specifically the data from the\r\nUniversity of Notre-Dame Adolescent Parenting Project, an on-going \r\nlongitudinal study of teen parenting. \r\n\r\nThe investigators develop statistical methodology for analysis of data\r\n that are not complete. In social and behavioral sciences, data are \r\noften collected in longitudinal studies and through questionnaires. Lack\r\n of compliance of subjects (e.g., dropping out of studies and/or \r\nincomplete responses) that leads to incomplete data is commonplace.\r\nThis project focuses on analysis of data that are missing not at random \r\n(MNAR). MNAR occurs when a case of a variable is not observed due to\r\n the value of that variable being atypical;  for example, a subject does not \r\nsubmit to a measure of the level of her depression because she is \r\nunusually depressed. To-date, adequate statistical methodology to analyze \r\nMNAR data has not been explored in SBS. The investigators formulate new \r\nmodels, develop inferential and computational methods for MNAR data, and \r\nillustrate the methods with social and behavioral science data sets. In the latter \r\nrespect, the investigators concentrate in applying the methodology to analyze a \r\nset of data collected by University of Notre Dame which studies teen parenting. \r\nThe analyses are carried out  in the context of structural equation modeling \r\nwhich has been widely used in a variety of disciplines including education, \r\nmedicine, psychology, sociology, and other areas related to human behavior.",
