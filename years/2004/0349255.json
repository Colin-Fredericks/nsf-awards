 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Boyd Goodson of Southern Illinois University at Carbondale will engage in NMR and optical/nuclear double resonance (ONDR) studies of the structure and dynamics of molecular and (bio)macromolecular complexes in liquid-crystalline matrices.  The goal is to bring about an improved understanding of host-guest interactions, protein-ligand binding events, and other biological phenomena involving weak but specific interactions.  In a second part of this project he will incorporate these research initiatives into the undergraduate physical chemistry curriculum while mentoring undergraduate students in independent research.  \r\n\r\nThe research part consists of three related components: 1) the preparation and NMR investigation of inclusion complexes and xenon-protein complexes oriented in various crystalline matrices; 2) the use of laser-polarized xenon to probe interactions with complex-forming molecules and proteins via spin-spin cross-relaxation; and 3) the combination of these two components, whereby the interactions will be amplified by both the optical enhancement of xenon nuclear magnetization and the restoration of  dipolar couplings between xenon and host molecules using liquid crystals.  The research will be conducted with graduate and undergraduate students.  The integration of research into the undergraduate curriculum will emphasize depth over breadth, inquiry-based learning, and exposure to state-of-the-art methods.  \r\n\r\n",
