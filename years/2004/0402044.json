 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for award  DMS-0402044 of Ramakrishnan   \r\n\r\n The general theme of this proposal is the study of the ubiquitous cusp\r\nforms in various contexts. The four specific problems proposed deal with the\r\narithmetic, analytic, geometric and group theoretic\r\naspects of these fundamental objects. To elaborate, the first problem asks\r\nif certain four dimensional Galois representations attached to cusp forms\r\nare irreducible, and such results are unknown in dimensions bigger than 3.\r\nThe second problem deals with obtaining *exact* averages of twisted L-values\r\nof holomorphic cusp forms, and the ensuing implications for class numbers\r\nand a diophantine question. The third problem suggests that in special but\r\npervasive instances (like for the Delta function), there should be\r\nCalabi-Yau varieties which geometrically realize the associated motives and\r\nhence  the L-functions, which encode the statistical properties of Frobenius\r\ntraces. The fourth problem is concerned with the *-selfdual representations\r\nof reductive groups G admitting involutions *, and asks for a study of a\r\ncertain sign attached to cusp forms on G.\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate certain mysterious and deep relations\r\nBetween automorphic functions, which are continuous and pulchritudinous, and\r\ndiscrete objects like the integers and their building blocks, namely the\r\nprime numbers, which exhibit haunting statistical properties. Automorphic\r\nfunctions encode enchanting symmetries occurring in nature like the\r\nwaveforms on a disk. The discrete tones therein have alluring arithmetical\r\nmeanings. Often mathematicians and physicists build generating functions\r\nout of discrete collections of numbers, and the pressing problem is to know if\r\nthese functions admit hidden symmetries, that is, if they are describing\r\nthe tones of automorphic functions. If they do, then miraculous benefits emerge.\r\nExploiting them is a worthy endeavor, and there are many gold mines yet to be discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
