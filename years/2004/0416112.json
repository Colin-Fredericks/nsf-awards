 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Paul Barbara of the University of Texas at Austin will conduct research with his student and postdoctoral colleagues on the development of Fluorescence-Voltage Single Molecule Spectroscopy (F-V SMS) as a powerful tool for probing the molecular level properties and processes of nanomaterials and nanomaterials-based devices.  The specific techniques, methods and theoretical models developed in this research will provide a powerful new tool for the investigation of technologically-important materials to be used in future electronics applications, including OLEDs, medical sensors and solar cells.\r\n\r\nBesides the broader scientific impact of the research, the research will result in the training of two female postdoctoral researchers in the Prof. Barbara's laboratory, as well as the training of graduate students.  Prof. Barbara and his postdoctoral and graduate student colleagues will also be participating in the \"Nano at the Border\" program, which provides research and educational opportunities to disadvantaged Hispanic students.  This program was co-founded by Prof. Barbara in 2002.\r\n",
