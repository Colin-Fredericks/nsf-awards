 "awd_abstract_narration": "0339310\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to develop an ultrasensitive, real-time, laser-based explosives sensor. The novel, all solid state, laser-based system can be configured in numerous embodiments for use in walk-through, baggage, and cargo screening portals and can potentially be manufactured in man-portable versions for mine sweeping applications. The proposed sensor\r\nwill combine a new laser technology with a new detection method to exceed the detection limits of presently employed ion mobility mass spectrometry based systems by orders of magnitude. The proposed sensor will be capable of rapidly detecting and discriminating among ultratrace levels of different explosives in real time with unparalleled sensitivity. The sensor will be capable of detecting common explosives such as TNT, RDX,\r\nand PETN at parts-per-trillion concentration level with high chemical specificity in less than 10 seconds.\r\n\r\nThe commercial markets for such a sensor system are enormous and the need immediate. The proposed instrument will enable explosives to be detected in real-time with unparalelled sensitivity and selectivity. The same instrument can also be used for the trace detection of chemical warfare and potentially biological warfare agents. In addition to security applications, the same sensor can be used for applications in industrial process control, environmental monitoring, and natural gas sensing.",
