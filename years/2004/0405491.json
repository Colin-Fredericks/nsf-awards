 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our project will study the role of monotonicity in low dimensional \r\ngeometry and topology, in the context of a number of specific problems. \r\nFirstly, we will study actions of (topologically natural) groups \r\non 1-dimensional manifolds, especially actions on the line and the circle, \r\nbut also on non-Hausdorff 1-manifolds. Such actions are closely related \r\nto the theory of foliations and laminations in dimension 3. Our tools \r\nwill include the theory of foliations and laminations, recent results \r\nin gauge theory, computational tools, and constructions of new topological \r\nobjects associated to such actions. We will also study the question of existence\r\nand classification of such actions when one passes to finite index\r\nsubgroups, in analogy with the Virtual Haken conjecture. Related to\r\nthis, we will investigate the problem of whether a random 3-manifold\r\ngroup has a faithful action on the line. Finally, we will expand the\r\nrange of these techniques from dimension 3 to dimension 4 by studying\r\n4-manifolds with pairs of transverse 2-dimensional foliations. By \r\nvarying the analytic quality of these foliations, we hope to arrive\r\nat a different point of view on some of the mysterious geometric\r\ninequalities arising from gauge theory. We will do this by exploiting\r\nold and new results about bounded cohomological properties of groups\r\nacting on the plane with good analytic qualities.\r\n\r\nMonotonicity is an important principle in analysis, geometry and topology.\r\nThe best known examples are essentially 1-dimensional in origin;\r\nmonotonicity lets one define such objects as the real numbers in terms\r\nof the order structure of its elements. More generally, such order\r\nstructures provide a bridge from geometric problems to algebraic language,\r\nand permit one to perform experiments and construct certificates with\r\nthe use of computers. Monotonicity becomes increasingly hard to apply\r\nas dimension goes up; consequently it is most powerful when used in\r\nthe context of certain dynamical systems which reduce the study of the\r\nmanifold to two complementary problems of smaller dimension: the study\r\nof the orbits of the system, and the study of the parameter space of\r\nthe orbits. \r\n",
