 "awd_abstract_narration": "The pace of urbanization is accelerating in many parts of the world, leading to rapidly changing environmental conditions along urban-rural interfaces.  In turn, these changing conditions are creating new ecological and societal challenges and opportunities.  In March 2005, a major conference on \"Emerging Issues at the Urban-Rural Interface: Linking Science and Society\" will be held in Atlanta, Georgia.  The conference will bring together researchers, practitioners, and policy makers from around the globe to share current research results and to identify knowledge gaps regarding the interaction between urbanization and natural resources.  Special attention will be focused on approaches that integrate socioeconomic and ecological research.  Topics to be explored at the conference include human dimension issues along urban-rural interfaces, urbanization and the sustainability of ecological functions, effects of urbanization on rural areas, the impact of urbanization on the supply of and demand for environmental services, the eco-politics of urbanization, urbanization impacts on species fragility, species protection, and biodiversity, how communities successfully deal with urban/rural issues, and restoring ecosystem integrity in response to urban impacts.  This award will provide funding to enable about three dozen graduate and undergraduate students to attend and participate in this conference.\r\n\r\nExpected contributions of the conference include enhancement of communications among researchers, practitioners, and policy makers.  This award will provide about 35 graduate and undergraduate students with the opportunity to explore this topic and to interact with leading researchers in a scholarly setting.  This project is supported by an award resulting from the FY 2004 special competition in Biocomplexity in the Environment focusing on the Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems.\r\n",
