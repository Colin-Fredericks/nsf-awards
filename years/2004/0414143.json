Understanding the transport properties of charged macromolecules in such materials is a key to their development and optimum design.  New insights have  recently been  obtained  through  microscopic  studies, which  can  provide  the  basis  to  develop  a  mechanistic  understanding  of  transport.  This project will  expand  current  efforts  in  this  area  with  the  ultimate  goal  of developing new adsorbents and membranes for protein separations as well as models to predict their process performance.  Protein  partitioning  and  transport  in  charged  dextran  gels  and  agarose-dextran  composites will be studied  on  a  microscopic  scale  focusing  on  the  effects  of  gel  properties  and  protein  molecular weight and charge on equilibrium uptake and mass transfer kinetics.  Kinetics of protein ion-exchange in charged poly(acrylamide) gels and charged agarose-dextran composites  will be studied  using  radiotracer  techniques  to  elucidate  protein  transport  under  both gradient and tracer diffusion conditions.  Modeling  single  and  multicomponent  protein  transport  in  ionic  gels  and  application  of  these models to predict the behavior of column chromatography under processing conditions will be performed.  This research  will  provide  a  higher level  of understanding of transport phenomena in these complex media as well as models to aid the design and optimization of chromatographic processes.  The research  will  have  multiple  broader  impacts.  It will guide the development of optimized stationary phases by media  manufacturers.  It will  also provide  a  basis  for  the  formulation  of  rate  models  to predict and optimize chromatographic separations permitting pharmaceutical companies to improve the design and efficiency of bioprocesses. Since  separation  and  purification  are  often  the  costliest  steps  in bioprocessing,  there  is  a  critical  need  for  separation  scientists  and  engineers  who  are  trained  to develop and implement novel separation media integrating a broad spectrum of experimental and modeling approaches to improve the effectiveness of industrial bioseparations. \r\n",
