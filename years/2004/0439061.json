BroadNets is a new conference on broadband networking that covers the spectrum of next-generation networks in which ultra-high bandwidth is available from access to metro to core. The conference consists of two symposia, the Broadband Optical Networking Symposium, and the Broadband Wireless Symposium, as well as several workshops. The collaborative support of these two events under the umbrella of broadband networking will contribute to initiate, develop, and foster relationships between the research communities. For students it is an opportunity to meet and discuss their research with some of the most notable researchers in these fields.",
