 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose  to study charge transport and storage in ultra-thin, oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) \r\nheteroinsulator  nanostructures,  which  find  application  in  high  density,  low-power,  low  voltage, \r\nnonvolatile  semiconductor  memories  (NVSMs).  In  particular,  we  will  examine  a  new  type  of \r\nSONOS device called a NROMTM structure, which is programmed with hot electron injection and \r\nis able to store 2 bits of information spatially isolated over source and drain regions of the device.  \r\nIn addition, each of these bits has the possibility of multi-level storage opening the possibility for \r\nultra-high density NVSMs. The study of device physics, the technology and potential applications \r\nof ultra-thin oxides are also relevant to the thrust into low-power CMOS circuits so our study will \r\nencompass experimental nanoscaled SONOS devices fabricated with fully-depleted silicon on \r\ninsulator (FDSOI)  CMOS  technology. Characterization  of  traps  at  the  semiconductor-insulator-\r\ngate interfaces and in the bulk insulator is an essential factor in predicting the performance and \r\nreliability of nanoscaled semiconductor devices, such as SONOS NVSMs.  Our research program \r\nwill investigate the fundamental limitations in nanoscaled SONOS NVSMs.  \r\nThe  intellectual  merit  of  this  proposal  resides  in  a  vision  where  future  advancements  in \r\nnonvolatile  semiconductor  memory  storage  will  play  a  central  role  in  nanoscaled  science  and \r\nengineering. Our program integrates research and education to explore high-density NVSMs with \r\nunique heteroinsulator structures.  The experimental and theoretical study of novel devices will \r\nentail the use of physics, chemistry, materials science and device electronics at the nanoscale with \r\nconsiderable opportunity to explore new frontiers through the generation of new knowledge. \r\nThe broader aspects in our program will advance diversity in the nanoelectronics workforce \r\nand provide intellectual technology transfer, integration of research and education, and promotion \r\nof partnerships. We have excellent educational and outreach programs to increase diversity with \r\nopportunities  in  nanoelectronics,  especially  semiconductor  devices  .  an  important  area  to \r\nmaintain US leadership in a global economy. This research program provides an excellent vehicle \r\nfor student research and education, minority student outreach and partnerships with industry.",
