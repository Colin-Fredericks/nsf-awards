Schoen and L. Simon. Relaxing the embeddedness hypothesis\r\nallows the presence of additional singularities, for instance points\r\nwhere the tangent cones are hyperplanes with multiplicity greater than\r\none. It is proposed to investigate the nature of these singularities,\r\nwith the aim of obtaining information concerning the size and the\r\nstructure of these singularities, possible uniqueness of their tangent\r\ncones as well as the local nature of the hypersurface near the singularities.\r\nThe second project proposed is a study of the effect of certain\r\ntopological and analytic constraints (on the target\r\nmanifold) on the regularity propeties of the singular sets of energy\r\nminimizing harmonic maps between Riemannian manifolds.\r\n\r\n  The regularity theory of minimal surfaces and harmonic maps has a very\r\nrich history and the results and ideas developed in these areas have\r\nprofoundly influenced several other fields of contemporary research in\r\nmathematics and physics,\r\nsuch as Yang-Mills fields, free boundary problems, curvature flows and\r\ngeneral relativity.\r\nObtaining a good structural description near singularities turns out to be\r\nhighly desirable in many problems in pure and applied mathematics, and any\r\nnew advances in minimal surface theory in this regard will likely have\r\nan impact on these other fields.\r\n\r\n",
