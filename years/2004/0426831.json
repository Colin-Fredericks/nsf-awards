 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe proposed research develops theory and techniques for monitoring and diagnosing faults, hazards or, more gener-ally,\r\nfunctional changes in dynamic systems and networks, under limited and possibly corrupted information. We present\r\na unifying and multifaceted approach to this problem that decomposes the large body of fault diagnosis research into six\r\ntopics: (i) deterministic fault diagnosis, (ii) model-based probabilistic diagnosis, (iii) adaptive and sequential diagnosis,\r\n(iv) distributed system-level diagnosis with communication constraints in wired/wireless networks, (v) fault diagnosis\r\nvia distributed belief propagation algorithms, and (vi) model-independent diagnosis. The research team will leverage\r\nits expertise in the areas of fault diagnosis, sequential detection, system-level diagnosis, distributed control, modeling,\r\nanalysis and performance evaluation, applied probability, graph theory, belief propagation and model reduction to the\r\nproblem of detecting, identifying and localizing faults and abnormalities in dynamically evolving environments. Beyond\r\nintellectual value, the research program proposed will have broader impacts in a variety of ways.\r\nBroader Impact: Networks and networked systems are increasingly solidifying their roles as building blocks of the\r\nnation's economic and social foundation. Numerous emerging commercial, governmental, medical, military and security\r\napplications are vitally dependent on these systems, creating a growing need for ensuring that these critical infrastructures\r\nare reliable and trustworthy in spite of malicious or non-malicious disruptions. Building trustworthy networked systems\r\nusing off-the-shelf components and software presents a significant hurdle that needs to be overcome in order to exploit the\r\nfull potential of networked systems. The proposed project outlines a synergistic and comprehensive approach for scalable\r\nmethodologies for diagnosing faults, adversarial behavior and threats in complex systems and networks, under uncertain\r\ninformation and possibly in the presence of communication errors and constraints. The successful completion of this\r\nproject will make a substantial and timely contribution to the National Priority Area of National and Homeland Security\r\n(NHS) because of its ramifications in the monitoring, testing, and reliable and secure operation of networked systems,\r\ncommunication networks, and complex digital systems. The development of distributed algorithms for fault diagnosis\r\nand the resulting overall enhancement of distributed systems in ways that make them more reliable also contributes\r\nto the National Priority Area of Advanced Science and Engineering (ASE). The integration of data models, distributed\r\nalgorithms, system dynamics, control and decision making is aligned with the technical focus area of data, models and\r\ncommunications (dmc), and the development of critical support mechanisms for reliable operation of complex dynamic\r\nsystems and networks is aligned with the technical focus area of integration of computing (int).\r\nIntellectual Merit: The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the synergistic and comprehensive exploration of dif-ferent\r\ndimensions within the broad area of detection and identification of faults or, more generally, abnormal behavior in\r\ncomplex dynamic systems and networks. The ultimate goal is to develop appropriate models and innovative distributed\r\nalgorithms that integrate and unify techniques from a number of diverse disciplines, including fault diagnosis in discrete\r\nevent systems, detection and estimation, graph theory and optimization, distributed system-level diagnosis, belief propa-gation,\r\nmodel reduction and information theory. Apart from advancing the forefront of the various individual approaches\r\nto diagnosis, the overarching theme is the integration of these ideas into a well-defined approach that achieves the ad-vantages\r\nof both deterministic and probabilistic methodologies via scalable models and algorithms. While extending the\r\nfrontiers in the broad area of fault diagnosis in complex dynamic systems and networks, this research will at the same\r\ntime leverage the applicability of these techniques to the design of test platforms for experimenting with distributed fault\r\ndiagnosis in ad-hoc mobile networks and fault localization in indoor sensor networks.\r\nEducational Impact and Outreach: The main educational goals of this program are two-fold: (i) To develop courses\r\nand educational materials that discuss systematic approaches for algorithms and architectures for fault diagnosis and\r\ntolerance in complex systems and networks. For example, Web-based lectures on special topics of interest will be\r\nestablished for practicing engineers in the field; a senior/graduate level course on this topic will be developed; a central\r\nWeb-page will be maintained at the University of Illinois to disseminate new results within the members of the team as\r\nwell as to the broader scientific and research community. (ii) To continue to actively recruit and mentor participants from\r\nunderrepresented groups in our respective research programs.\r\n1",
