If the functional is the Dirichlet integral, one is led to the\r\nDirichlet problem for the Laplace equation. If the functional is, instead, the\r\nsupremum norm of the length of the gradient, uniqueness of minimal \r\nextensions is\r\nlost unless the problem is reinterpreted - the resulting notion is here called\r\n\"absolutely minimizing\". Owing to work of Aronsson in the 60's and \r\nJensen in the\r\n90's, one knows that, upon this proper reinterpretation, there is an associated\r\nDirichlet problem which has a unique solution. However, the partial \r\ndifferential\r\nequation involved is now a highly degenerate quasilinear elliptic equation, the\r\n\"infinity-Laplace\" equation. Moreover, the infinity-Laplace operator must be\r\nunderstood in the generalized sense of viscosity solutions. In the \r\noriginal works,\r\nthe \"length of the gradient\" was the Euclidean length. For some other \r\nnotions of\r\nlength, such as the natural maximum norm, there is only an existence theory and\r\nuniqueness is unsettled. This is one simple example of a basic question in this\r\narena as yet unresolved. Others include, even in the case of the \r\nEuclidean length,\r\nuniqueness in unbounded domains, the famous problem of \r\ndifferentiability of infinity\r\nharmonic functions (recently settled in two space dimensions by Savin), and the\r\npossibility of other more refined results - perhaps generic - on the \r\nstructure of\r\nsolutions. These issues will be studied in this project. \r\n\r\nThe infinity-Laplace equation is an archetypal object in the subject called\r\n\"calculus of variations in L-infinity\" by its founders. Roughly speaking, it\r\ncorresponds to designing for the worst case, clearly an important issue with\r\npotential relevance to many fields.  One well established area of \r\napplication of\r\nabsolutely minimizing functions is in image processing. While this project is\r\nprimarily mathematical, the questions asked are basic\r\nand aimed at archetypes (as opposed to technically complex generalizations).\r\nSuccess will illuminate the general theory and thereby its current and future\r\napplications.\r\n",
