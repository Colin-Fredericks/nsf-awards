 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the four-day conference is to examine the role that Optimality can play, or should play, in modern statistics. Due to the advent of high throughput data collection technology and the parallel development of computing power to analyze such data, it often happens that statistical theory gives way to raw computing power. Although most of the new exciting statistical methodologies have provided tools to make headway in many important scientific problems, a need to generalize and systematize this knowledge is now quite evident.\r\nThe Symposia will take place in Rice University and will bring together a group of experts to discuss cutting-edge research optimality ideas in the context of modern statistical methodologies. Although much progress has taken place in areas such as data visualization and data mining and knowledge discovery, the subjects are ripe for the development of an optimality paradigm that allows for objective comparisons of methodologies. This new paradigm, although still to be defined, is necessary to push the research frontiers in these important disciplines.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conference will showcase new developments by leading researchers in an environment conducive to the development of new human resources. The focus will be the development of theoretical ideas to provide strong underpinnings to the many successful efforts in computation intensive areas where statisticians have contributed. This award supports twelve young investigators and eight Ph.D. students to attend the conference. Women and minority young investigators and Ph.D. students will be actively recruited and encouraged to apply. Refereed papers will be published.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
