Walz, Yale University\r\n\r\n\r\nThis GOALI proposal will be a collaborative effort between researchers at Yale \r\nUniversity and NexPress Solutions LLC aimed at developing improved models for predicting the effect of heterogeneities on both the long-range and adhesive forces between particles and surfaces.  NexPress is a joint venture between Kodak and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG that develops and produces digital printing equipment.  Understanding the effects of heterogeneities, in the form of either surface roughness or surface charge heterogeneity, is important in any process concerned with the deposition or adhesion of particles, or the stability of a particle dispersion.  It is especially critical in the electrophotographic process, where toner particles, which are both rough and nonuniformly charged, must be transferred via an applied electric field from a conductive substrate, to which they are adhered, to the receiving surface.  While various researchers have addressed the specific problems of either surface roughness or charge nonuniformity, this work will be the first that includes both effects in a rigorous manner. \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit of the Project \r\n\r\nThis project will consist of both modeling and experimental components.  First, a model will be developed for calculating the electrostatic and van der Waals forces between a planar substrate and a particle of arbitrary roughness and charge distribution.  This work will build upon prior work by one of the PI's in which a boundary element model was developed for calculating the electrostatic interaction between two charged particles of arbitrary morphology.  In addition, \r\nthe electric field strength needed to detach an adhered particle, which is a critical parameter in the electrophotographic process, will be calculated.  The models will be valid in both air and aqueous environments.  The experimental work, which will be designed to validate the model predictions, will consist of direct measurements of both the adhesion force and the force-vs-distance profile using techniques such as atomic force microscopy (single particle measurements) and centrifugal detachment (detachment of many particles).  The degree of roughness on the particles will be varied using controlled deposition of nanoparticles.  The project will also address the effects of heterogeneities on the stability of a particle dispersion. \r\n\r\nThere will be four primary outcomes of this work:  (1) a rigorous boundary element model capable of predicting the electrostatic and van der Waals forces between a substrate and particle having both surface roughness and charge heterogeneity will be developed, (2) an improved, approximate model for calculating the adhesion force between a rough, elastic particle and planar substrate will be developed, (3) a simple method for producing particles with controlled degrees of roughness will be tested, and (4) a thorough analysis of the effect of both surface roughness and charge heterogeneity on the stability of a colloidal dispersion will be performed.  These outcomes will significantly advance our ability to predict and control the deposition and adhesion of particles,  as well as the stability of a colloidal dispersion. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts of the Project \r\nThis project will promote a collaborative relationship between Yale and NexPress.  It will provide direct support for a post-doctoral research and Ph.D. graduate student.  In addition, the graduate student will spend up to one year at NexPress laboratories in Rochester, NY, gaining experience with an industrial research environment.  Finally, the project will contribute new material to a series of courses in colloids and complex fluids that are currently offered in Yale's chemical engineering department, which will enhance our graduate program in these areas. \r\n",
