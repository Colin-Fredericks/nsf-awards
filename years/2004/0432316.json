Professor Benny Freeman (University of Texas at Austin) is the meeting chair and Professor Glenn Lipscomb (University of Toledo) and Matthias Wessling (Twente University) are co-chairs.  The program will feature the latest developments in membrane science and technology in areas of national interest including energy, biotechnology, and water treatment. The presentations will come from a balanced slate of industrial, academic, and governmental speakers; many of the academic speakers will be NSF awardees. Additionally, the presentations will include work supported through current national research initiatives such as the National Nanotechnology and Homeland Security Initiatives. In terms of the broader impacts, support of the meeting will have a direct impact on the development of young researchers. The requested funding will be used to support attendance of graduate students, post-doctoral research associates, and young faculty from U.S. institutions. Attendance at the Gordon Conference will provide an opportunity to discuss their work with more senior researchers and to stimulate their interest in a career in the membrane field. Historically, the Gordon Conference has also been a fertile ground for the cultivation of new collaborations and research ideas.\r\n",
