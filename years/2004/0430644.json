 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n--------\r\n\r\nIn a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, a linear function of\r\na symmetric matrix variable $X$ is minimized subject to linear\r\nequality constraints on $X$ and the essential constraint that $X$\r\nbe positive semidefinite.  Many mathematical optimization problems\r\ncan be cast as SDP problems including linear programming (LP) problems,\r\nconvex quadratic problems with convex quadratic inequality constraints,\r\nmatrix norm minimization problems, and a variety of maximum and\r\nminimum eigenvalue problems. In addition, SDP has many\r\napplications in combinatorial optimization, engineering,\r\nstatistics, and robust optimization.\r\n\r\nToday, there are numerous algorithms and codes available for\r\nsolving LPs, SDPs, and other cone programs,\r\nand these methods can be loosely grouped into three types:\r\nsecond-order interior-point (IP) methods based on exact linear solvers,\r\nsecond-order IP methods based on iterative linear solvers, and first-order\r\nnonlinear programming (NLP) methods. The choice of which type to\r\nuse for a particular application is determined primarily by\r\nproblem size --- second-order IP methods based on exact linear solvers\r\nare more efficient on small- to medium-scale problems while\r\nfirst-order NLP methods and second-order IP methods based on iterative\r\nlinear solvers are better for large-scale problems.\r\n\r\nSecond-order IP algorithms for SDP are derived from similar\r\nalgorithms for LP and, in\r\nparticular, inherit the polynomial-time complexity of IP methods\r\nfor LP. In addition, as in LP, the subclass of primal-dual methods\r\nand their higher-order variants are very effective for solving SDP\r\nproblems practically. In contrast to LP, however, there are many\r\nways one can compute the Newton search directions used in\r\nprimal-dual algorithms for SDP. For this reason, the theory and\r\nimplementation of primal-dual methods for SDP is substantially\r\nmore difficult than that for LP.\r\n\r\nFirst-order NLP algorithms have been developed as an alternative\r\nto second-order IP methods (based on exact linear solvers)\r\nfor solving large-scale SDPs that arise\r\nin certain applications, e.g., in combinatorial optimization.\r\nThese methods reformulate the SDP problem into a NLP problem that\r\ncan be solved using standard NLP techniques --- in particular,\r\nfirst-order techniques that do not require as much computation as\r\nsecond-order techniques. The exclusion of second-order\r\ninformation, however, makes it difficult (perhaps impossible) to\r\nestablish the polynomial complexity of such algorithms.\r\n\r\nPolynomial convergence analysis of second-order IP methods based on\r\niterative linear solvers is still a topic which is not well-understood.\r\nSince these methods have the potential to outperform first-order\r\nmethods in the solution of large-scale SDP problems, it is of\r\nparamount importance to study the theoretical and practical behavior of these\r\nmethods. This proposal will address this topic in depth first in\r\nthe context of the basic LP problem and then in the context of\r\nother cone programming problems such as quadratic programming (QP),\r\nsecond-order cone programming and SDP.\r\n\r\nThis proposal addresses the development of the theory and\r\nimplementation of algorithms for SDP and also investigates the applications\r\nof SDP. The objectives of this research project consist of:\r\n1) advancing the knowledge of the theory and implementation of\r\nsecond-order primal-dual methods for LP, SDP and other cone\r\nprogramming problems;\r\n2) developing and implementing second-order IP algorithms based on iterative\r\nlinear solvers for LP and more general cone programs;\r\n3) developing new and/or improving existing algorithms and implementations for\r\nfirst-order smooth and non-smooth methods for SDP;\r\n4) enhancing the variety, applicability, usefulness, and robustness\r\nof first-order NLP methods for SDP;\r\n5) developing SDP heuristics for combinatorial problems based on low-rank\r\nrestricted SDP problems; and\r\n6) develop new insights of the geometry of the central path and its\r\nconsequences into the polynomial solvability of IP methods.\r\n\r\nThis research will lead to new and improved algorithms and codes\r\nto find exact or approximate solutions to optimization problems\r\narising in diverse applications in industry, finance, science, and\r\nengineering.\r\n",
