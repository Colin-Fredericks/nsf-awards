 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nSome of the most important theorems in mathematics are those which\r\nconnect up different fields, concepts or view-points. In algebraic\r\nnumber theory many of such theorems go under the name of reciprocity\r\nlaws. The general framework for reciprocity laws is the Langlands\r\nprogram. Much of the PI's work deals with issues that arise from\r\nreciprocity laws especially in the context of linear, mod p\r\nrepresentations of the absolute Galois group of the rationals. A\r\nreciprocity law in this case has been conjectured by J-P. Serre.\r\nMotivated by Serre's conjecture and related issues the PI has studied\r\ncongruences  between modular forms and deformations of  Galois\r\nrepresentations. The PI will continue to study and develop tools to\r\napproach such reciprocity laws and related questions that have a\r\nbearing on the intricate relationship between automorphic forms and\r\nGalois representations in the future.\r\n\r\nAny progress towards establishing reciprocity laws has a very broad\r\nimpact that is felt all across number theory. The work of the PI on\r\nreciprocity laws involves coming up with new ideas and techniques that\r\nimpact many central areas of mathematics, like those mentioned above,\r\nand potentially might be useful to applications of number theory in\r\nareas like cryptography that are of great practical use. The PI also\r\nexpects to disseminate knowledge by involving students in research\r\nproject\r\n",
