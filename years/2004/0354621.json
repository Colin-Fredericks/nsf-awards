It can be used to understand how a geometric structure evolves\r\nto a more canonical one or the union of canonical structures. In most \r\ncases, there\r\nis a tension field which governs the evolution. The most notable cases \r\nare the harmonic\r\nmap flow, the Ricci flow, the mean curvature flow, the Gaussian \r\ncurvature flow, and the\r\ninverse mean curvature flow. The long time existence and asymptotic \r\nbehavior of the geometric\r\nstructure has revealed deep understanding of geometry and topology. Even \r\nshort time existence\r\nhave immediate consequence of smoothing out the structure. For example, \r\nthe short time existence of the\r\nRicci flow for complete manifolds with bounded curvature provides \r\nsmoothing effect  to\r\napproximate the metric by metrics with bound covariant derivatives of \r\ncurvature.\r\nAll these geometric flows have many common features, most notable is the \r\nfundamental role\r\nof solitary solutions of the flow. It gives strong understanding of \r\nsingularity of the nonlinear\r\nsystem and lead to good estimates: like the Li-Yau-Hamilton estimate \r\nwhich play important\r\nroles on singularity formations. While working on the Ricci flows, there \r\nare constant insight by\r\nworking on the mean curvature flow and other geometric flows, and vice \r\nversa. The works of\r\nHuisken and Sinestrari will be important for this purpose. And so is the \r\nwork of Huisken-Ilmanen\r\non the inverse mean curvature flow. The most recent breakthrough of \r\nPerelman will of course be the central piece\r\nof discussion for the whole project. Not only that we like to make sure \r\nthe whole program of\r\ngeometrization for three manifolds, but also we like to strengthen and \r\napply the technique to various\r\nimportant geometric situation: the Ricci flow for compact Kaehler \r\nmanifolds with positive Chern\r\nclass, and to four dimensional manifolds. Note that the recent work of  \r\nCao-Chen-Zhu has\r\nalready pointed to the importance of the argument of Perelman in the \r\nKaehler case. Perelman's\r\nmost recent work in the Kaehler case made further progress. We hope to \r\nincorporate it in a bigger picture of\r\nKaehler geometry. When one studies the Kaehler geometry, a very \r\nimportant ingredient to understand\r\nMirror geometry for Calabi-Yau manifolds is the study of special \r\nLagrangian submanifolds. This\r\n has been pursued by M.- T. Wang using the Lagrangian mean curvature flow .\r\nThe existence and regularity of such submanifolds will play important \r\nroles in the future of geometry. As\r\nwas mentioned above, the inverse mean curvature flow will also be \r\nimportant for our discussions as it was\r\ndemonstrated by the work of  Huisken-Ilmanen in solving the Riemannian \r\nPenrose conjecture. In terms\r\nof general relativity, Bray, Huisken, M.-T. Wang and Yau will be very \r\nmuch involved in the analysis of\r\nvarious flows that appeared. (Huisken-Yau used the mean curvature flow \r\nto study center of gravity,  Bray\r\nstudied the Penrose conjecture) As a whole, there will be close \r\ncooperation and many students will be\r\ntrained under this joint program.  We also expect to have joint \r\nconsultations. Applied mathematicians will\r\nalso be consulted on questions like porous media flow,  diffusion of \r\noil, imaging sharpening, etc.\r\n Daskalopoulos has been active on porous media  flow, the Gaussian \r\ncurvature flow and related questions.\r\n\r\n",
