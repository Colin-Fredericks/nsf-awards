 "awd_abstract_narration": "Songbirds possess a talent rare among non-human animals:  the ability to learn complex vocalizations.  The system of brain regions that controls the learning and production of song has become perhaps the most popular model for studying the neural basis of a complex learned behavior.  Despite this popularity, few researchers have investigated how the song system is connected to and affected by brain regions outside it.  Song is produced only in specific social contexts, and is undoubtedly controlled in part by a distinct network of brain regions involved in the regulation of social behavior in general. Here, the PI proposes to map this \"social behavior network\" in songbirds and explore how it affects song and its perception.  Neuroanatomical methods will be used to identify connections among these regions, and to determine which brain cells and proteins in the network participate in song and other social behaviors.  By connecting brain areas that mediate social behavior with those processing social information, the project effectively merges cognitive and affective neuroscience.  The results will help us understand how the brain perceives social cues as well as how it organizes and implements an appropriate social response. The PI's multi-disciplinary approach offers exciting pedagogical opportunities to train new scientists in a variety of laboratory and field techniques, and challenges students to ask questions on many levels, from molecular to evolutionary.  The teaching plan emphasizes writing skills, and includes development of new writing-intensive courses in the sciences.  The PI hopes to help train future scientists to communicate effectively, not only with each other, but also with the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
