 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of operator algebras originated in the 1930s with the\r\nefforts of J. von Neumann and others to develop rigorous mathematical\r\nmodels of quantum mechanical systems.  A fundamental precept of this\r\ntheory is that the time evolution of such a mathematical model is\r\nprescribed by a one-parameter group of automorphisms.  A more general\r\npicture is obtained if one considers evolutions of systems that can move\r\nforward but not necessarily backward in time.  This notion leads to the\r\nstudy of one-parameter semigroups of endomorphisms, as opposed to (time\r\nreversible) one-parameter groups of automorphisms.  Price hopes to\r\ncontinue his work with two leaders in the field, Alexis Alevras and\r\nRobert T. Powers, on classifying families of semigroups of endomorphisms\r\nthat act on the operator algebras of all bounded operator on a Hilbert\r\nspace.\r\n \tPrice also plans to continue his study of endomorphisms on the\r\noperator algebra called the hyperfinite II_1 factor.  The hyperfinite\r\nII_1 algebra R is of fundamental importance in the study of operator\r\nalgebras and is itself related to certain mathematical models of spin\r\nsystems.  Previously he has used number-theoretic ideas to arrive at a\r\ncomplete classification of the family of endomorphisms on this algebra\r\nknown as binary shifts.  His current work in this area is focused on\r\nobtaining a complete classification of all endomorphisms on R whose\r\nimage is maximal in R.  This work uses ideas from combinatorics and\r\nlinear algebra as well as number theory.  The linear algebraic and\r\ncombinatoric aspects of this study are expected to lead to some research\r\nproblems that are accessible to gifted undergraduate students.  Price\r\nproposes to continue working with mathematics majors who are interested\r\nin honors projects related to this work.\r\n",
