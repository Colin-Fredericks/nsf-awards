 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program consists of three lines of investigation, each \r\nconnected to multivariate analogues of generalized hypergeometric \r\nfunctions.  The first concerns a family of biorthogonal abelian \r\nfunctions associated to elliptic curves that generalize multivariate \r\northogonal polynomials due to Macdonald and Koornwinder.  The second \r\naspect involves certain multivariate analogues of quadratic \r\ntransformations of hypergeometric functions, which generalize identities \r\nfrom the theory of symmetric spaces; related to this is the study of \r\nnatural deformations of permutation actions of Coxeter groups to \r\nrepresentations of the associated Hecke algebras, some of which have led \r\nto proofs of multivariate quadratic transformations.  Finally, the \r\ninvestigator will be studying multivariate elliptic hypergeometric \r\n(contour) integrals, with a view to understanding the functional \r\nequations satisfied by such integrals.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the study of \"special functions\" originated in the fact \r\nthat quite a few functions of interest in applications turned out to be \r\nmembers of a single family, the hypergeometric functions.  The new \r\nfamily of functions the investigator is studying is a significant \r\ngeneralization of this family, combining several existing \r\ngeneralizations (each with their own applications and connections to \r\nother areas of mathematics) under one roof.  In addition to the \r\npotential that new applications may arise, this investigation should \r\nalso lead to a greater understanding of the existing families.\r\n\r\n",
