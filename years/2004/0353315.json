 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a series of print and web resource guides in science and mathematics based on curriculum topic study (CTS), an approach developed and tested successfully by one of the PI's.   CTS is used to provide a systematic way of intellectually engaging K-12 mathematics and science teachers with national standards and cognitive research.  It is used to engage teachers in thought and discussion about both content and appropriate ways of teaching that content.  Three books will result from this project, \"A Science Curriculum Topic Study Resource Guide,\" \"A Mathematics Curriculum Topic Study Resource Guide\" and \"A Facilitator's Guide to Using Curriculum Topic Study.\"  In addition, the project will result in professional development, follow-up evaluation studies, and a web site developed over four years.  A total of 955 teachers will participate in the project.  WestEd's Science and Mathematics Division will actively collaborate and TERC is providing the external evaluation.  Dissemination is anticipated through many professional associations, a publishing partner, Math-Science Partnerships, and national conferences.\r\n\r\nThe CTS approach guides teachers through a systematic study of a curricular topic by using a core set of resources to clarify learning goals, examine instructional and developmental implications, identify potential misconceptions, examine K-12 concepts and their interconnections and reflect back on their own state or local standards.  With these three guides this project aims to increase the understanding and implementation of content standards throughout a teacher's career and to elevate the content and pedagogical content knowledge and skills of teacher leaders and professional developers.  The guides will improve the consistency in how teachers and teacher educators interpret and implement standards and research findings nationally; hone the ability to envision substantive improvement in curricular content, instruction and assessment; and provide increased science and mathematics focus in professional development.\r\n",
