The PBL models being adapted are drawn from sucessful applications at the University of Delware, San Diego State University, University of California-Irvine, and others. CME 430 - Land Development, traditionally a lecture-based content-oriented course has been transformed into a technologically advanced course that uses problem-based-learning (PBL) as the primary pedagogical tool. A design-build project is being used to provide the PBL experience. The Industry Advisory Team (IAT) meets regularly to assist the project. The team played a vital role in the development of the assessment and evaluation tools. The NDSU Information Technology Services unit provides support for three hands-on computer lab sessions related to web page development. Several course lecture sequences were converted to Power Point and are integrated with the video sequences in eTEACH throughout the course. The development of the Personal Response System (PRS) is underway.",
