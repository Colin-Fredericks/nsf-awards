 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, the principle investigator (PI) proposes\r\nresearch on four important topics aimed to develop methods\r\nof statistical inference and model diagnostics in cases of\r\ncorrelated observations. These topics are: (i) partially\r\nobserved information and inference about non-Gaussian\r\nlinear mixed models; (ii) iterative weighted least squares\r\nprocedures for analysis of longitudinal data; (iii) A test\r\nof global maximum for dependent observations; and (iv)\r\ngeneralized linear mixed model diagnostics. Linear mixed\r\nmodels are widely used in practice for correlated observations.\r\nA typical assumption regarding these models is that the\r\nobservations are normally distributed. However, the normality\r\nassumption is likely to be violated in practice. It is known that\r\nnormality based methods such as REML still produce consistent\r\nestimators even if normality fails. However, the estimation\r\nof standard errors of these estimators is complicated, because\r\nfor non-Gaussian data the asymptotic covariance matrix of the\r\nGaussian estimator involves additional unknown parameters.\r\nProject (i) aims to completely solve this long-standing problem\r\nof practical interest. Furthermore, project (ii) proposes an\r\niterative weighted least squares procedure for computing\r\nefficient estimators of the regression coefficients in linear\r\nmodels for longitudinal data analysis and studies its properties.\r\nProject (iii) aims to extend a method developed in the i.i.d.\r\ncase for checking whether a root to the likelihood equation\r\ncorresponds to the global maximum of the likelihood function.\r\nProject (iv) develops goodness-of-fit tests and methods of\r\ninformal model checking for generalized linear mixed models.\r\n\r\nCorrelated responses are often encountered in practice. For\r\nexample, in medical studies repeated measures are often collected\r\nfrom the same individuals over time. It would be reasonable to\r\nassume that correlations exist among the observations from the\r\nsame individual. Linear and generalized linear mixed models are\r\ntwo important classes of statistical models widely used in cases\r\nof correlated observations. For linear mixed models methods of\r\ninference have been developed, but mostly under the assumption\r\nthat the observations are normal (or Gaussian). However, the\r\nnormality assumption is likely to be violated in practice. The\r\nPI aims to develop a powerful method for inference about\r\nnon-Gaussian linear mixed models. For generalized linear mixed\r\nmodels, the PI proposes to develop methods of model checking\r\nthat fills an important gap in the applications of these models.\r\nThe methods developed are likely to have impact in other fields\r\nof statistics as well as in fields such as biomedical research,\r\ngenetics, biology, economics, education and social science.\r\n",
