The premise of Viral Radio is that it is possible to make energy- and spectrum-efficient radio communications networks that scale (almost) without bound.  An adaptive distributed set of nodes treats RF signal relaying in a given space as a distributed optimization process whereby each radio uses the presence of other radios to assist and cooperate in messages delivery.  Relaying is done without demodulation or buffering; thus eliminating delays normally associated with multi-hop ad hoc networks.  A distributed routing algorithm controls the relays, and the ultimate destination nodes use the combination of original signal and relayed signals, plus the variability of propagation between source and destination to allocate signal energy in space to maximize throughput while minimizing interference between concurrent messages.  This research path eventually leads to highly scalable and highly efficient real-time telecommunications and broadcast systems that rely on no central radiator or suite of cell towers.  By showing how spectrum capacity can be increased by the presence of other, cooperating elements, Viral Radio suggests a new paradigm for spectrum management that allows the most communicating elements in a region without mutual interference rather than the least.  This research can add additional practical weight to this argument, and can be used by those who are weighing new policy alternatives.\r\n\r\n",
