 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Grant for Exploratory Researh provides support for two annual institutes that will each bring together approximately 60 graduate students and junior faculty and fifteen instructors for two weeks of intensive instruction in, and discussion of, state of the qualitative research methods.\r\nThese institutes seek several complementary goals.  First, they train graduate students and junior faculty in qualitative methods so they can improve the use of these methods in their own work and teach graduate courses on qualitative methods at their home institutions.  Second, they allow faculty to present recent and ongoing work on qualitative methods for feedback from other faculty as well as institute students.  Third, they provide direct feedback to institute students on their current research designs (in most cases, the research design of their Ph.D. thesis).  Fourth, they provide networking opportunities among and between students and faculty and encourage collaboration in efforts to improve and disseminate qualitative methods.\r\nThe institutes are sponsored by the Consortium on Qualitative Research Methods (CQRM).  The syllabus from the 2003 institute, and a pdf file of the face-book distributed to attendees, are available at the CQRM website:  http://www.asu.edu/clas/polisci/cqrm.\r\n\r\nThis training grant has the added broader societal value of providing outstanding standards for students who indertake qualitative research.",
