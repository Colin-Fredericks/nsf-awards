 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for award DMS-0401525 of Gunnells\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal concerns problems in number theory, algebraic\r\ngeometry, and representation theory in three broad areas.  First, the PI is focusing on topics related to cohomology of arithmetic groups and\r\nallied areas, such as geometry of locally symmetric spaces and their\r\ncompactifications, modular curves and rings of modular forms, and\r\nspecial values of L-functions.  Second, he is investigating the\r\ngeometry of canonical Kazhdan-Lusztig cells in affine Weyl groups.\r\nFinally, he is joining F. Hirzebruch and D. Zagier in the updating of\r\ntheir book, The Atiyah-Singer theorem and elementary number theory.\r\n\r\nThis proposal deals with number theory, algebraic geometry, and\r\nrepresentation theory.  Number theory is the study of the properties\r\nof the whole numbers, and is the oldest branch of mathematics.\r\nAlgebraic geometry studies geometric figures that can be defined by\r\nthe simplest of equations, namely polynomials.  Representation theory\r\nis the systematic study of symmetry, through the development of simple\r\nmathematical objects that encode the fundamental irreducible pieces of\r\nsymmetry.  Today the questions and phenomena addressed by these\r\nsubjects serve as driving forces in much of contemporary mathematics\r\nresearch.  Moreover, the subjects have contributed many applications\r\nin such diverse areas as codes and data transmission, robotics,\r\nchemistry, physics, and theoretical computer science.\r\n\r\n",
