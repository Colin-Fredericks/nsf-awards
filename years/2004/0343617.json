 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to test two alternative genetic mechanisms for the evolution of reproductive isolation.  One possibility assumes that selfish genes compete for transmission by sperm while an alternative assumes that antagonistic genes that facilitate male fertilization have negative effects on female reproduction. Both of these processes can cause genetic arms races within populations, which may cause hybrids between populations to be sterile. The selfish gene hypothesis will be tested by locating hybrid sterility factors to determine if they are near those that influence transmission of selfish X chromosomes and by comparing DNA sequence evolution between chromosome regions. The antagonistic gene hypothesis will be tested by comparing the rate of evolution of reproductive to nonreproductive traits in males and females and by determining if sperm competitive ability depends on genetic divergence between populations.\r\n\r\nDetermining how reproductive isolation evolves is essential for understanding the origin of species. The research proposed here is notable because alternative genetic mechanisms for reproductive isolation will be evaluated and will utilize isolated populations of stalk-eyed flies, genus Cyrtodiopsis, from southeast Asia.  Stalk-eyed flies are ideally suited for this work because populations that exhibit hybrid sterility, selfish sex chromosomes and variable genetic divergence are available for study.\r\n",
