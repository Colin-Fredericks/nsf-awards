 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is awarding thirty scholarships per year for four years to students enrolled in a computer science, computer technology or mathematics Associates Degree and/or transfer program. A primary goal is to increase opportunities and provide access to higher education and employment for underrepresented minorities and women. Recruitment efforts are targeting schools with high concentrations of African-American and Hispanic students. Recruitment materials are being prepared in Spanish and English. \r\n\r\nThe school is creating learning communities; scheduling scholars in common classes; providing them with supplemental instruction; and expanding an extensive array of support services, which includes program specific orientation sessions, tutoring, and mentoring. The project is strengthening partnerships with local and regional industries. Industrial representatives are aiding the recruiting, retaining, and mentoring processes by pairing scholars with an industry mentor, engaging students in monthly seminars and apprising them of local internship and cooperative work opportunities. Additional support in mathematics is being provided to ensure that students have strong mathematics skills for both industry and four-year transfer degrees. There is an emphasis on encouraging students to major in mathematics. \r\n\r\nThe assessment and evaluation plan is using formative and summative assessments to determine the effect that each of the elements of the program has on retaining the scholars and is providing feedback for improving the process. The database to track CSEMS scholars is being adapted from one that was developed by Portland Community College in their CSEMS project.    \r\n",
