Dense ad hoc networks suffer from\r\nsignificant capacity limitations that suggest scalability may only be achieved if we restrict ourselves\r\nto localized network traffic patterns. Moreover, such sensor-actuator networks have a large number\r\nof clients sharing the same communication channel, so that contention between different clients will\r\ngreatly reduce the amount of data that can be streamed between sensors and actuators. Maintain-\r\ning specified levels of overall control system performance in such a non-deterministic environment is\r\nextremely challenging and we feel that it can only be achieved if we adopt a cross-layer approach in\r\nwhich application (i.e., control) algorithms and networking protocols are intimately aware of each\r\nothers capabilities and limitations. This project investigates fundamental relationships between\r\ncontrol system performance and network quality-of-service (QoS). The project will use these rela-\r\ntionships to develop decentralized control algorithms and supporting network middleware services\r\nthat can guarantee application (control) performance over extremely large ad hoc sensor-actuator\r\nnetworks. The intellectual merit of the proposed work lies in its precise characterization of the\r\nway in which network middleware impacts control system performance. The project will demon-\r\nstrate these algorithms and services on a physical testbed in which a spatially-distributed physical\r\nplant is controlled in a decentralized manner over an ad hoc radio (RF) network of embedded\r\nprocessors.\r\nThe project's broader impacts will be felt through its impact on undergraduate education at\r\nNotre Dame as well as through on-going collaborations with civil, environmental, and mechanical\r\nengineering researchers both in and out of Notre Dame. In particular, the project's proposed testbed\r\nwill be tied to undergraduate courses in electrical and mechanical engineering, thereby providing\r\nstudents with a novel opportunity to contribute to an on-going research program. Moreover we\r\nare collaborating with civil/environmental engineers to develop sensor-actuator networks that can\r\naddress the combined-sewer overfow (CSO) problem faced by a number of municipalities across\r\nthe Midwest and Eastern United States. The results from this project have the potential to reduce\r\nanticipated costs associated with solving the CSO problem. The results from this project will\r\ntherefore have a broad societal impact extending well beyond the immediate project objectives.",
