 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award furnishes travel support for participants in the regional workshop on Semiclassical Approximation and Vacuum Energy, held in January 2005 at Texas A&M University as part of a special year in Mathematical Physics.  Topics of the workshop include modeling of vacuum energy in nanodevices and application of quantum graph theory to microstructures and optical materials.  This meeting provides an opportunity to increase interdisciplinary collaboration of U.S. researchers in fundamental questions of mathematical physics.\r\n\r\nResearch collaboration between mathematicians and physicists is increasingly important in view of recent advances in the development of nanoscale devices, novel optical materials, and Bose-Einstein condensates.  This workshop provides an opportunity for informal interaction between leading experts and junior researchers in important related areas of mathematical physics.  The workshop, in conjunction with Special Year introductory programs, will provide a particularly valuable opportunity for graduate students to broaden their understanding of these topics and to learn about open problems in the field.\r\n",
