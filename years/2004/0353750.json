 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Earth and Environmental Science (CEES) at Plattsburgh State University (PSU) and the W.H. Miner Agricultural Research Institute seek to continue to provide eight-week summer research experiences for 12 highly motivated undergraduate students with broad academic training in the natural sciences and multifaceted  interests in ecosystem research.  Our principal objectives are to promote the professional development of our student \r\nresearchers through their participation in ongoing interdisciplinary research of natural and managed fluvial and  riparian ecosystems in the Little Chazy River watershed of northeastern New York.  REU participants, individually  and in small groups, will work closely with the program.s faculty mentors on research projects ranging from surface \r\nand ground water hydrogeology, geochemistry (nutrient cycling), and aquatic invertebrate, riparian and wetland ecology.  The computer and laboratory resources at PSU and Miner Institute will be available for the REU project.  The Plattsburgh REU program will challenge its student researchers to think broadly and creatively about their  research, expand their disciplinary focus and develop an interdisciplinary perspective.  The REU students will also participate in a weekly Environment and Society Workshop series that is carefully designed to link the scientific \r\naspects of their watershed research to relevant social and ethical concerns. \r\n\"This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program\"\r\n",
