 "awd_abstract_narration": "Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) Implementation Plan Workshop\r\n\r\nChris Paola, University of Minnesota\r\nEAR-0413249\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests funds for a workshop to develop an implementation plan for the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System.  The goal of CSDMS is to develop a suite of community-based models for the main process sets that shape the Earth's surface and create its stratigraphic record.  An initial \"community sediment model\" workshop held in February 2002 attracted strong support for the initiative and led to a white paper outlining the rationale, goals, and structure of the CSDMS project.  The results and recommendations of this white paper were later presented to NSF personnel and NSF feedback recommended that a strategic implementation plan for CSDMS needed to be developed before further progress toward funding could be made.  As CSDMS is a community-wide initiative, this would be best accomplished through a community workshop and thus the rationale for this request.  A functioning set of community based, continuously improving models for the dynamics of the Earth's surface would be a cornerstone of environmental management and forecasting, just as atmospheric models are the bases for weather forecasting.  Thus CSDMS would support land management, river and landscape restoration, stewardship, of scenic and recreational landscapes, assessment of terrain-related natural hazards like floods and landslides, and responsible development of resources from upland forests to hydrocarbons in sedimentary strata.",
