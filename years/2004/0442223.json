 "awd_abstract_narration": "An integrated approach focusing on synthesis and characterization of new membrane materials for fuel cell applications is proposed.  In addition to nanoclays, nanohybrid membranes will be synthesized using nanospheres and 3D nanoporous inorganics.  To that end, random structured xerogels and 3D meso and nanoporous silica and zeolites will be investigated.  Besides Nafion, we plan to include other polymers including newly developed poly(arylenethioether) sulfones at AFRL/MLBP.  The proposed work provides a framework for rationally developing new proton exchange membranes and combines the expertise in nanocomposites at Cornell, nanoparticles technology at UOP, polymers for fuel cells at AFRL/MLBP and testing and evaluation at MTI MicroFuel Cells. \r\n\r\nProton exchange membrane fuel cells offer significant advantages as clean and efficient energy conversion systems.  One of the big challenges facing the scientific community is to engineer a membrane material that fulfills all materials requirements, is inexpensive and endures the aggressive fuel-cell environment for a long period of time.   The objective of this program is to design and develop nanohybrid proton membranes, which combine high proton conductivity (especially at low relative humidity/high temperature), low gas permeability and methanol crossover, decreased swelling, and mechanical robustness for fuel cell applications.  The Approaches to Combat Terrorism Program in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences supports new concepts in basic research and workforce development with the potential to contribute to national security.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n",
