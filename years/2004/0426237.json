 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis is a request for travel funds to support students participating in the 2004 IEEE\r\nConference on Decision and Control (CDC04) to be held in the Paradise Island, Bahamas,\r\nDecember 14 -17, 2004. The funds will be used for travel support of students from US\r\ninstitutions, who will be presenting papers at the conference.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The CDC is one of the world's largest and most important conferences\r\non control theory and applications, with over a thousand participants and very high\r\nquality presentations. The CDC is an annual conference, now in its 43rd year. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: This travel grant will enable students to participate in the 43rd CDC,\r\npresent their papers and interact with more senior researchers and other students. The\r\nCDC with its consistently high quality papers is an ideal place for dissemination of\r\nresearch results. The CDC attracts well-known researchers from around the world and it\r\noffers a unique opportunity to meet and interact with them. It is anticipated that the\r\nopportunity, made possible by this grant, for students to go to the CDC will encourage\r\nthem to further pursue high quality research and will have significant impact on both\r\nresearch and education in the systems and control area, which spans several science and\r\nengineering disciplines.",
