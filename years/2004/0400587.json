 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project involves measure rigidity of higher rank partially\r\nhyperbolic abelian actions and applications thereof. It is\r\nconjectured that under certain circumstances there are very few\r\nprobability measures both invariant and ergodic under such actions\r\n(Furstenberg, Margulis). So far all of the current work relies on\r\nthe additional assumption of positive entropy (Johnson, Rudolph),\r\nand sometimes on additional ergodicity along critical directions\r\n(Kalinin, Katok, Spatzier). Substantial progress has been made\r\nrecently in avoiding unnecessary ergodicity-type assumptions as\r\nwell as in applications of measure rigidity (Einsiedler, Katok,\r\nLindenstrauss).  Einsiedler will continue his study of invariant\r\nmeasures avoiding additional ergodicity-type assumptions, work on\r\ndisjointness properties of various higher rank dynamical systems,\r\nfurther applications of rigidity, and related algebraic topics.\r\n\r\nThe theory of dynamical systems is a relatively new, but important\r\nmathematical theory with many connections to other parts of\r\nmathematics as well as other sciences such as physics,\r\nmeteorology, or computer sciences. Historically it developed from\r\nthe study of the evolution of a deterministic but complicated\r\nphysical process (for instance in celestial mechanics) over time.\r\nEspecially if this process is too complicated to predict long term\r\noutcomes precisely, the theory of dynamical systems is important\r\nbecause it can give qualitative predictions. More recently\r\nsymbolic dynamics turned out to be crucial to find efficient and\r\nsafe coding algorithms in computer sciences. There is also a long\r\ntradition of using dynamics to solve problems in other areas of\r\nmathematics. The study of higher rank dynamical systems (where\r\ntime has more than one dimension) has received much attention\r\nduring the last years, in part again because of its connections to\r\nphysics (in particular statistical mechanics) and computer\r\nsciences (higher dimensional data storage methods). The proposed\r\nresearch links three separate areas of mathematics, namely ergodic\r\ntheory, Lie theory, and algebra. The rich interplay among these\r\nfields helps to attack problems by using tools from different\r\nareas. The most prominent connection is between dynamics on\r\nhomogeneous spaces and number theory, which holds the key to\r\nproblems in the theory of Diophantine approximation. However, the\r\ntheory of dynamical systems can benefit from this interaction too\r\nsince dynamical systems of algebraic origin are often more\r\namenable to a detailed study of their dynamical properties while\r\nthe phenomena encountered are interesting in the larger context of\r\ngeneral dynamical systems.\r\n",
