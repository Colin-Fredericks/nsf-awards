 "awd_abstract_narration": "Due to the difficulties in precisely computing some of the key\r\nquantities, such as the channel capacities and the detection error\r\nprobabilities, most of the current analytical work in wireless\r\ncommunications has been limited to asymptotic analysis in a number of\r\nmutually separated regimes. As a result, the engineering conclusions\r\nbased on these studies are sometimes incompatible, making it hard to\r\napply the analytical results in the designs of practical systems. The\r\ngoal of this research is to develop novel approaches to address the\r\ninteractions among several key system parameters, to understand the\r\njoint impacts of them, and to synthesize the different theoretical\r\nresults into one unified picture.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project studies the emerging new technologies in\r\nmulti-input multi-output (MIMO) channels and ultra-wideband\r\nchannels. Most current research on these systems has been focused on\r\ndifferent limiting cases, including high/low signal power, wide/narrow\r\nbandwidth, and fast/slow time-variation of the channel.  Such\r\nasymptotic analysis greatly simplifies the problems. However, since\r\nusually one parameter is isolated and taken to its limit, the relation\r\namong different parameters is sometimes distorted, resulting in\r\ninconsistent conclusions. This project aims to solve such problems by\r\ndeveloping new approaches to asymptotic analysis that address the\r\ninteractions among several key system parameters, including channel\r\ntime-variation, power and energy efficiency, bandwidth scaling,\r\nreliability and delay requirements, and peak-to-average ratio\r\nconstraints. A key component of the new approach is to take multiple\r\nparameters to their limits together, but keep a carefully chosen\r\nrelation among them. Such an approach, while maintaining the\r\nsimplicity of the asymptotic analysis, helps to describe a continuum\r\nthat bridges the gap between the current results for different extreme\r\ncases.\r\n",
