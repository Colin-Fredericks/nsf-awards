 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports research by Buss and his graduate\r\nstudents on computational complexity, proof complexity,\r\nalgorithms, and numerical methods.  Buss investigates proof theory\r\nand proof complexity, especially aspects that are closely connected\r\nto open problems in computational complexity including the\r\nP versus NP problem.   The relevant proof systems include\r\nbounded arithmetics, which are first-order theories tailored to have\r\nlogical strength related to feasible computability, and\r\npropositional proof systems, which have rich connections to bounded\r\narithmetic and circuit complexity.  Buss will work to establish\r\nlower bounds on proof complexity based on complexity assumptions\r\nsuch as the existence of provably secure cryptographic systems.\r\nHe will work to prove new independence results and separation\r\nresults for weak proof systems.  He will investigate what kinds\r\nof computational content can be extracted from proofs.\r\nBuss will investigate the proof complexity of propositional systems such as\r\nFrege systems, cutting planes systems, Nullstellensatz proof systems,\r\ncounting axioms, the polynomial calculus, and intuitionistic proof systems.\r\nBuss also works on numerical and geometric algorithms arising\r\nfrom computer graphics.  He will work on simulation methods for\r\nrigid multibodies using higher-order approximation methods over\r\nmanifolds, on symplectic algorithms and other energy-conserving\r\nalgorithms for physical simulations, and on collision response\r\nalgorithms.\r\n\r\nThe main part of this research lies at the interface between \r\nmathematics and computer science and is motivated by open questions \r\nconcerning the fundamental limits of computation.  These open \r\nquestions include the P versus NP problem, the mathematical\r\nfeasibility of secure cryptographic coding, and the optimality\r\nof particular algorithms and circuits for solving combinatorial problems.\r\nThis project addresses these questions by investigating computational\r\ncomplexity and proof complexity.  Lower and upper bounds on\r\nproof complexity are closely related to upper and lower bounds\r\non the hardness of computation.  This in turn is closely\r\nrelated to the mathematical underpinnings of crytography.\r\n",
