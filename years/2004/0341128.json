 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) This project develops methods and tools that facilitate effective teaching in both traditional and non-traditional introductory Physics environments. We are producing a web delivery system for a proven interactive pedagogy, Interactive Lecture Demonstrations (ILDs) that we developed earlier.  Prototype WebILDs, like in-class ILDs, lead to significant changes in conceptual understanding and are easy to implement. Starting with this proven, research-based, pedagogical method and our successful WebILD prototype software we are:\r\n\r\n1) refining, using student learning as a guide, the Motion, Force, and Energy WebILD prototype by testing it with larger and more diverse introductory course audiences and using it for learning at a distance.  \r\n2) creating WebILD sequences in additional physics topic areas.  \r\n3) refining delivery and administration software and making the software and the WebILD sequences available nationally. \r\n \r\nThis project focuses on the learner and uses well established conceptual evaluations to measure learning. We are using the flexibility of internet-delivery to adapt ILDs to increase their already considerable efficacy with under-prepared students including women and minorities.  This project meets a need for distance learning, for pedagogical methods that work with Internet delivery, and for methods to teach teachers. \r\n",
