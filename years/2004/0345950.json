 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bilingualism is becoming more prevalent in the U.S.A., mimicking the state of affairs in almost all other parts of the world.  More and more people use at least two languages at home, at school, or at work.  The apparent bilingual future invites several questions about the nature or bilingualism: How do bilinguals deal with the different language situations they encounter? Can they use each language selectively according to the situation, or are both languages always automatically available in all contexts?   To what degree does one language interfere with or facilitate the other?\r\n\r\nWith NSF support Dr. Canseco-Gonzalez will answer these and similar questions using an innovative technique that allows her to manipulate how and whether the environment elicits bilingualism and thereby study the impact on bilinguals.  The broader impacts of the research are relevant to policy makers, educators, social services providers, and parents alike. For instance, should driving tests always be administered in a driver's first language? Should children learn two languages simultaneously?  This research also encourages participation by  underrepresented minorities both as undergraduates engaged in research and  as research participants.\r\n",
