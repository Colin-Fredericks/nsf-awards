 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this proposed research project are to:\r\n\r\n1- complete the first comprehensive survey and inventory of tree\r\ncanopy biodiversity from three meters to the upper canopy for biota\r\nrepresented by myxomycetes, other mycetozoan groups (protostelids and\r\ndictyostelids), fungi, mosses, liverworts, lichens, ferns, selected\r\ninsect groups, and molluscs in the Great Smoky Mountains National\r\nPark\r\n\r\n2- assemble a multidisciplinary research team of experts who will\r\ncollect, identify, and curate this diverse group of organisms and\r\nserve as mentors who will give special lectures, slide shows, hands on\r\nidentification of specimens, and field demonstrations to aid students\r\nin the recognition of specimens and collection of samples;\r\n\r\n3-compare the assemblages of tree canopy organisms with those\r\nfound on ground sites;\r\n\r\n4-search for species new to science in all of the targeted groups\r\nof organisms;\r\n\r\n5- sample for biota along vertical transects of individual trees at\r\ndifferent heights to quantify the association of the relative species\r\ncomposition, abundance, and diversity of these assemblages with the\r\navailable environmental characteristics (host tree species, vegetation\r\ntype, height class, light, pH, and humidity);\r\n\r\n6- compare the tree canopy-targeted groups and assemblages on\r\ndifferent tree species;\r\n\r\n7- provide research experiences for students that will enhance\r\nopportunities for postgraduate study.\r\n\r\nThis study will determine if the biota (myxomycetes, protostelids,\r\ndictyostelids, fungi, mosses, liverworts, lichens, and ferns), of\r\nspecies assemblages, and communities found on the bark of living trees\r\nand vines above three meters differ from those found in habitats on\r\nground sites.  This project will assist in determining if these\r\nassemblages and communities can be predicted based on measured\r\nenvironmental parameters that will provide a basis for future\r\ncomparisons with forests that are harvested using forestry management\r\nstrategies.  The methodology used to obtain samples from the tree\r\ncanopy will be the double rope climbing technique that will enable the\r\ncollector to access the treetops.  Collections will be made from the\r\ntree canopy and also from moist chamber cultures in the laboratory. \r\nStatistical analysis of species assemblages identified from each tree\r\nwill be compared. \r\n\r\nThese species assemblages and communities are important since they are\r\nthe first species to show signs of environmental degradation such as\r\nacid rain, sulfur and nitrogen dioxide deposits, and ozone.  Data\r\ngenerated from this project will help park managers assess the\r\nenvironmental impacts of human factors not only in old growth forests\r\nbut with any forest vegetation type.  This project will involve four\r\nRUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) institutions collaborating in\r\nthe study of the different targeted groups of organisms with an\r\ninternational component of experts from Norway, Russia, and Lithuania\r\nwho will provide species identification for specific groups of\r\norganisms.  Women and minorities who are underrepresented in field\r\nbiology research will participate along with volunteers, park interns,\r\nundergraduate and graduate students, and key project personnel. \r\n Results will be highlighted in park interpretive exhibitions, website\r\noutreach,  news media coverage (print and television), publication of articles in\r\npopular  magazines, in refereed journals that will send a powerful\r\nconservation message for biodiversity.\r\n\r\n",
