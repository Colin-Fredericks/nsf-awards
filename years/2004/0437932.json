 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is (i) to fabricate the organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) using novel techniques that do not introduce defects at the surface of organic semiconductors, and (ii) to use these devices to explore fundamental limits of organic electronics.  The novel fabrication approach is based on lamination of elastomeric transistor stamps against high purity organic molecular crystals.  These unique single-crystal OFETs will enable realization of the ultimate performance of organic materials, not limited by structural defects or chemical impurities. \r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the proposed work consists of (i) development of new soft-contact-lamination techniques for OFET fabrication that preserve the high quality of pristine surface of organic crystals; (ii) studies of the effect of individual surface defects on transistor characteristics; (iii) reduction of the contact resistance using self-assembled monolayers, and (iv) studies of the organic crystals by surface analytical techniques.  The work will have a significant impact on foundations of \"plastic\" electronics and understanding of fundamental transport properties of organic materials.  The novel stamping techniques that emerge from the proposed research will find applications in many areas of flexible electronics.  The interdisciplinary structure of the program provides excellent educational, human resource and outreach opportunities.  The Educational and Outreach part of the project is designed to develop innovative training modules in novel electronic materials and devices.  Implementation of the proposed research fosters training of students who will be exposed to the state-of-the-art facilities of semiconductor research, and can pursue careers in either an academic or industrial environment.\r\n",
