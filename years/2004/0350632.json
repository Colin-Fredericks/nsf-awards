Veziroglu, Director of the Clean Energy Research Institute, Miami University, Miami, Florida and Dr. Yuksel Kaplan, Mechanical Engineering Department, Nigde University in Nigde, Turkey.  The PIs plan a combined experimental and theoretical study.  In the experimental program, a reactor will be designed and manufactured and the parameters such as materials, reactor geometry and processing conditions affecting the hydrogen storage will be investigated over a wide range of parameter space.  Data obtained from the experiments will be used to validate and further improve the mathematical model and design the optimum hydrogen reactors.  In the theoretical part of project, a mathematical model which considers complex heat and mass transfer and fluid flow during the hydriding process will be developed. The mathematical model will serve understanding the basic mechanism of hydriding process. The coupled differential equations will be solved with a numerical method based on integrations of governing equation over finite control volumes. The driving force for fluid flow will be considered to be pressure difference due to temperature gradients in the system.  The experimental part of the project will be performed at Nigde University and theoretical study will be performed at Nigde University and University of Miami. The ultimate goal of this project is to improve the knowledge and substructure on the methods of hydrogen storage methods.\r\n\r\nScope:  Hydrogen is a unique synthetic fuel with unusual properties and characteristics, which are not shared, by other fuels. It is the lightest and cleanest fuel, and environmentally most compatible. It has very favorable combustion characteristics. It can be converted to other forms of energy, such as thermal, mechanical and electrical, with higher efficiencies than other fuels.  The research would contribute to the knowledge we have that is necessary to move this potential alternative fuel towards wide economical utilization with enormous environmental and societal benefits.  The project will involve one U.S. undergraduate student.\r\n",
