 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Symposium on Self-Organized Processes in Semiconductor Heteroepitaxy will be held December 1-5, 2003 at the Fall MRS Meeting, Boston, MA. The symposium is organized to bring together theoreticians and experimentalists from disciplines including physics, chemistry, materials science, and electrical engineering. Issues related to the understanding, control, and applications of self-organized processes in semiconductor epitaxy, e.g., strain-induced self-assembly; clustering, alloy phase separation, and composition modulation; and long- and short-range ordering will be addressed.\r\nSessions will be held on: 1) Quantum Dots: Ordering and Patterning; 2) Quantum Dots and Wires: Structure, Spectroscopy, and Transport; 3) Quantum Dots and Wires: Devices; 4) Spins in Semiconductor Nanostructures; 5) Composition Modulation; and 6) Atomic Ordering. The symposium is expected to stimulate collaboration and discussion between researchers, especially between young professionals and established experts and to identify critical scientific issues.\r\n%%%\r\nAn evaluation of the progress and status of fundamental phenomena involved in self-organized processes in semiconductor epitaxy and the utilization of self-organized processes in the growth and processing of electronic materials and device related structures will be of great value to progress in the electronics/photonics field. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties will be established among universities, research institutions, and industry. The requested NSF funds will be used to facilitate participation in the meeting by young faculty, postdoctoral research associates and graduate students.\t \r\n***\r\n",
