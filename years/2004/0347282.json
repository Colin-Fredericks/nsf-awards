 "awd_abstract_narration": "Systems which learn from data are by now widely used in many areas, and such systems will doubtless be\r\neven more ubiquitous in the future. As learning-based systems proliferate and are applied to larger and larger domains, the need for provably effective and efficient learning algorithms grows correspondingly more acute.\r\nThe object of the proposed research is to design and analyze such algorithms. More specifically, building\r\non the PI's previous work in this area, the two main research goals of this career development proposal are:\r\n1. To develop algorithms which can efficiently learn rich and important classes of Boolean functions\r\nin well-studied models of computational learning. Major focuses of this work will be (a)\r\nlearning Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) formulas, which are a standard form of knowledge representation;\r\n(b) learning various classes of Boolean circuits, which can be substantially more expressive\r\nthan DNF formulas; and (c) learning in the presence of irrelevant information, i.e. learning functions\r\nwhich depend only on a small unknown subset of domain attributes.\r\nWe note that previous work in this area has uncovered many interesting and useful connections between\r\nthese learning problems and complexity-theoretic structural questions about Boolean functions.\r\nAn important aspect of this research (and indeed a key component of our methodology) is to continue\r\nto explore and exploit these connections between learning and complexity.\r\n2. To develop and analyze other well-motivated models for computational learning, and to develop\r\nefficient learning algorithms for Boolean function classes in these models. Anticipated research\r\ndirections here include (a) giving efficient average-case learning algorithms for important concept\r\nclasses for which no efficient worst-case algorithms are known; (b) developing a theory of learning\r\nfrom nonmalicious random examples; and (c) studying the role of quantum computation in learning\r\ntheory. Each of these directions has the potential to yield positive learning results which go beyond\r\nwhat can be achieved in current standard learning models.\r\nThis research plan is closely integrated with a plan to achieve broader impact through education which\r\ninvolves students at all levels. Highlights of the education plan include: (a) developing new computational\r\nlearning theory courses and other theory courses at Columbia University for target audiences ranging from\r\nundergraduates to advanced graduate students; (b) introducing undergraduates to the excitement of research\r\nby actively engaging them in research, both in undergraduate courses and in extracurricular projects; (c)\r\nadvising and guiding graduate students in their development as researchers and educators; and (d) building\r\na strong theory group at Columbia by maintaining regular theory group meetings and organizing events such\r\nas Theory Day.",
