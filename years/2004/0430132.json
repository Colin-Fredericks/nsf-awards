Knowledge of insect diversity in this habitat is poor relative to\r\nthat found in other threatened areas in the tropics.  There is extreme urgency\r\nfor an insect survey in the Upper Guinean forests because this ecosystem is more\r\nthreatened and is disappearing more quickly than most other global hotspots.\r\nSevere pressure on these forests results from some of the highest human\r\npopulation growth rates, most intensive logging, and rampant bushmeat hunting\r\nfound anywhere in the world.  The main goals of this project are: 1) to conduct\r\nan intensive survey of insects in the Guinean forests of Ghana and two\r\nadditional areas in savannah and sub-sahalian regions, using a wide variety of\r\ncollecting techniques, resulting in the collection of a large diversity of\r\ninvertebrate groups previously unavailable to systematists; 2) to develop and\r\nrehabilitate a host country authoritative reference collection thereby creating\r\na national insect collection and integrating it into the global systematics\r\ncommunity; 3) to educate and train students and collaborate with scientists from\r\nGhana (University of Ghana (Legon), Centre for Scientific and Industrial\r\nResearch, and The Ghana Wildlife Society) and students from Western Kentucky\r\nUniversity on insect sampling techniques, biodiversity studies, and insect\r\ncuration providing much needed scientific systematic expertise in Ghana; 4) to\r\npartner with The Ghana Wildlife Society and other organizations and individuals\r\nby providing web accessible databases with identification keys and images of\r\nspider beetles and dung beetles and all available biological information on the\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n    The intellectual merit of this proposal is to ultimately better understand\r\nthe biodiversity of these poorly studied and highly threatened forests by\r\nproviding large numbers insect samples for study to improve insect taxonomy and\r\nclassifications, the cornerstone of biology, while they still exist.  This work\r\nwill also result in knowledge on the diversity and evolution of two main target\r\ngroups: 1) the spider beetles which are arguably the most poorly known group of\r\nAfrican beetles, and 2) the dung beetles that are still very poorly known and\r\nstudied.  The latter group is also ecologically unstudied in this region and is\r\nof great interest because of the complex communities and behaviors exhibited.\r\nThey are also indicative of ecosystem health and hence extremely useful to\r\nconservation organizations.  The broader impacts include a better understanding\r\nof African tropical forest biodiversity, its evolution, ecology, and\r\nbiogeography.  Additionally, the vital aspect of student training, developing a\r\nsystematics infrastructure in Ghana, partnering with the primary conservation\r\nagency in this country, and creating web accessible information on insects will\r\nlead to better education of citizens of Ghana and the United States and\r\nhopefully protection of the irreplaceable natural heritage of biodiversity in\r\nthe Upper Guinean forests of West Africa.\r\n\r\n",
