Louge, Gordon Research Conferences\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal solicits NSF funding to help young investigators (Graduate Students,\r\nPost-Doctoral Associates, Assistant Professors) attend the 2004 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Granular and Granular-Fluid Flow to be held at Colby College from June 27 to July 2, 2004.\r\n\r\nThe field of Granular and Granular-Fluid Flows is experiencing fast progress that is driven by the Mathematics, Physics, Engineering and Geophysics communities. The 2004 meeting will be the second GRC on this subject. Its purpose is to discuss cutting-edge research in this rapidly advancing field, and to encourage new collaborations from scientists in disciplines that normally do not intersect.\r\n\r\nGRC meetings are deliberately structured to foster open discussions on cutting-edge research. The 2004 organization committee has developed a program with 26 speakers talking about recent developments, 9 discussion leaders, and up to 80 posters. The PI will invite between 100 and 135 participants and, with NSF's help, encourage the participation of emerging researchers.\r\n\r\nFinally, the PI will also invite industrial participants. Merck, Procter and Gamble, and Exxon Mobil will send scientists who are active in the field. The flow of granular solids, their mixing behavior, the nature of colloidal suspensions, and the transport of gas-solid mixtures are examples of phenomena that are of considerable importance to industry.\r\n\r\n",
