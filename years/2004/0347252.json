The measurements will support precise, real-time identification of anomalies/intrusions, enabling future networks to function securely and efficiently--something that is seriously threatened in today's hostile and dynamic environment.  New, in-situ measurement systems will be built and deployed to collect traffic data from many locations across the Internet and store it in a centralized repository in an anonymized, privacy preserving format. Research access to the data will be provided through a private, secure web interface.  In conjunction with the measurement and data collection activity, the research will develop multiresolution analysis methods based on wavelets, which isolate distinct traffic characteristics in both frequency and time, thus enabling accurate and timely detection of anomalies/intrusions.  A library of measurement/analysis tools and the data repository will be made available to the research community.  This project will also develop a series of laboratory experiments to provide secondary and university students a hand-on means of learning about the Internet.  This effort involves collaboration on both the measurement and analysis activities with network operators, researchers in industry and researchers in disciplines outside of networking including applied math, statistics and signal processing.\r\n",
