 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop will identify US research capabilities, needs, and strategies for using catalysis to produce value-added chemical from biorenewable feedstocks.  The goals of the workshop are: 1) to identify and communicate critical needs for building scientific and engineering capabilities in catalysis to convert biorenewables to value-added products; 2) to assess the current state of heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis and biocatalysis research for conversion of biorenewables; 3) to identify curricular and workforce needs to prepare engineers and scientists for a biorenewables-based chemicals industry; 4) to develop and prioritize goals and directions for the development of effective catalysts and catalytic process for biorenewables conversion, including the integration of chemical and biochemical catalysis in the future \"biorefinery.\"  \r\n\r\nThe workshop will assist in developing a community of researchers with diverse professional and individual backgrounds for this new area of catalysis.  Workforce requirements for a biobased chemicals industry will be addressed including new educational initiatives.  Curricular issues for chemical engineering and chemistry departments will be addressed.  Participants will include faculty, industrial leaders, and national laboratory researchers. \r\n",
