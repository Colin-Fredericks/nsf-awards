 "awd_abstract_narration": "Horizontal gene transfer among microorganisms is a critical process \r\nthat impacts bacterial evolution over long time horizons as well as \r\nthe spread of traits such as antibiotic resistance on short time \r\nscales.  Recently there has been heightened public concern about the \r\nrisk of gene transfer from genetically engineered organisms to \r\nindigenous organisms and its consequences.  Many environmental \r\nmicroorganisms spend a large part of their viable life cycle in the \r\nporous medium of the natural subsurface, such as soils and aquifer \r\nmaterials.  Because it is a natural filter for water the subsurface \r\nalso provides a mixing zone for different strains of bacteria, that \r\neach partition between the aqueous and solid phases.  Thus to \r\nunderstand the ramifications of horizontal gene transfer in the \r\nnatural environment, it is important to study the interactions \r\nbetween different species as they undergo fate and transport in \r\nporous media.  The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the \r\nkinetics of microbial attachment-detachment to porous media solid \r\nsurfaces, and the coupled kinetics of horizontal gene transfer in \r\nporous media via conjugation.  The green fluorescent protein (GFP) \r\ngene expression system will be used with known hosts and recipients \r\noriginally isolated from soils to quantify rates of conjugative gene \r\ntransfer in controlled micromodel experiments.  The gene transfer is \r\nexpected to be limited by the paired residence time of host and \r\nrecipient cells together on solid surfaces, and so the distributions \r\nof these paired residence times and the distribution of gene transfer \r\ntimes will be compiled from the micromodel experiments.  The model \r\nfor these data will be crafted by combining a biased Levy motion with \r\ndrift for the bacterial transport in the porous media, with an \r\nalpha-stable random variable for residence time attached to surfaces, \r\nwith a non-Markovian reaction kinetic model for the gene transfer \r\nfrom host to recipient.  The intellectual merit of this project \r\narises from the coordinated collaboration of people with expertise in \r\nhydrology, microbiology, molecular biology, applied mathematics, and \r\nphysics, to (1) adapt new tools in genetic analysis and microscopy to \r\nstudy microbial activity and gene exchange at a molecular level in \r\nmicro flow chambers, and (2) use mathematics to extrapolate the \r\nfindings to understand processes at higher scales in the subsurface. \r\nBy combining experiment with theory we may be able to determine the \r\nmajor requirements for successful gene transfer.  The broader impacts \r\nof this project arise from the wide applicability of the results to \r\nmany areas including human health, disease propagation, medicine, \r\ncontaminant remediation, and evolutionary biology.  All of these \r\nphenomena involve the processes studied here, many in porous media \r\n(subsurface or biotic).  Educationally the project provides the venue \r\nby which results from the collaborative study can be incorporated \r\ninto the PI's undergraduate and graduate courses in microbiology, \r\nengineering, and mathematics.  The PI's also have a solid record in \r\ninvolving minorities and women in research, via the MARC/AIM program \r\nat Purdue, and the Women In Engineering (nee' Women Engineering Link) \r\nprogram at UC Davis, and this habit will be continued in this project.\r\n",
