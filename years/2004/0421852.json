 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is self-evident that in society, many if not the most important \r\ndecisions are made by groups. Group involvement is endemic, whether it be \r\nvoting among large populations or deliberation by small committees. A \r\nstandard view of group decision-making is that it facilitates exchanges of \r\nideas and information, which necessarily lead to better outcomes. This view \r\nstands in contrast to a striking empirical regularity, dubbed group \r\npolarization, whereby members of a deliberating group predictably move \r\ntoward a more extreme point in the direction indicated by the members' \r\npredeliberation tendencies. The aim of this project is to bridge the gap \r\nbetween the standard naive view of group decision-making and the empirical \r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on two distinct processes of group \r\npolarization. The first process operates in group decisions over risky \r\nprospects, where group members exhibit choice-shifts: They tend to take on \r\nmore extreme levels of risk (either riskier or more cautious), relative to \r\nthe levels of risk they would accept as individuals outside the group. The \r\nresearchers propose an explanation for choice shifts, which is based on a \r\nmodel of individual decision-making. Hence, the framework they offer \r\napplies not only to choice shifts observed in groups but also to commonly \r\nobserved biases in individual decision making. The second process analyzed \r\nin this proposal operates in groups that face a threat of disagreement. \r\nThis threat plays an important role in explaining the fact that preference \r\nintensities matter in group interaction, and do so in non-additive ways. \r\nThe researchers propose a dynamic model of group deliberation where each \r\nmember wishes to implement a distinct policy, and the favorite policy of \r\neach member imposes externalities on the other members. The researchers \r\ndiscuss how this model can accommodate notions of `extremism' and \r\n`tolerance', and offer a methodology to study the formal relation between \r\nthese two concepts. The proposed framework has the potential of allowing \r\nthe researchers to rank different supermajority rules by the level of \r\n`extremism' that they impose in equilibrium.\r\n",
