 "awd_abstract_narration": "Terman\r\n\r\n     The basal ganglia are a group of nuclei that play an important role in\r\nthe generation of movement.  Dysfunction of the basal ganglia is associated\r\nwith movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's\r\nchorea.  Structures within the basal ganglia have in fact been the target\r\nof recent therapeutic surgical procedures including pallidotomy and deep\r\nbrain stimulation.  Numerous experiments have demonstrated that neurons\r\nwithin the basal ganglia display a variety of dynamic behaviors; moreover,\r\npatterns of neuronal activity differ between normal and pathological\r\nstates.  Neither the origins of these neural firing patterns nor the\r\nmechanisms that underlie the patterns are understood.  The primary goals of\r\nthe project are to develop detailed computational models, based on\r\nexperimental data, for basal ganglia activity and to develop mathematical\r\ntools for analyzing these models.  The investigator systematically studies\r\nmechanisms underlying complex activity patterns found in a broad class of\r\nexcitatory-inhibitory neuronal networks.  These include a recently\r\nconstructed model for neurons within the so-called indirect pathway of the\r\nbasal ganglia.  He also uses geometric, dynamical systems methods to\r\nexplore how these networks transform incoming firing patterns. \r\n\r\n     The investigator develops a computational model for neuronal activity\r\nin the basal ganglia.  The model is used to formulate and test hypotheses\r\nconcerning the functional role of the basal ganglia in both healthy and\r\ndiseased states.  As it evolves, the model serves as a tool that can be\r\nused to test hypotheses about the function basal ganglia, the pathologies\r\nthat develop in motor disorders, and the mechanisms through which\r\ntherapeutic interventions such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) may prove\r\neffective.  In particular, a central aspect of this research is to test\r\nhypotheses about how DBS reduces parkinsonian motor symptoms.  This may\r\nlead to new strategies by which DBS can be applied.  Topics in this project\r\npresent tremendous opportunities for cross-disciplinary seminars, workshops\r\nand collaborations.  The principal investigator has been very active in the\r\ntraining of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students.  He has\r\norganized numerous workshops at international conferences and has lectured\r\nat several summer educational programs.  A primary goal of these activities\r\nis to help nurture a community of scholars from different disciplines\r\ninvolved in the mathematical biosciences. \r\n\r\n",
