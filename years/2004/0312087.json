 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Midwest Several Complex Variables Conference will be held on October 10-12,\r\n2003, at Syracuse University. This will continue the long time tradition of Midwest\r\nSeveral Complex Variables Conferences which became one of the highest quality and\r\nmost successful conference series in Complex Analysis. There have been many new\r\ninteresting developments in different fields of this area in recent years, especially in\r\nComplex Geometry, Complex Dynamics, Partial Differential Equations and Pluripotential\r\nTheory. The conference will provide a forum to exchange and to stimulate\r\nnew ideas from these disciplines, and to formulate new challenging problems that will\r\nhave important scientific impact. It is expected that this will result in increased understanding\r\nof the deeper mathematical issues in Complex Analysis. The conference\r\nspeakers include: Thomas Bloom (University of Toronto), Araceli Bonifant (SUNY at\r\nStony Brook), Jeffrey Diller (University of Notre Dame), Peter Ebenfelt (University of\r\nCalifornia, San Diego), Vincent Guedj (University Paul Sabatier, Toulouse), Sergei\r\nIvashkovich (Universit des Sciences et Technologies de Lille), Imre Patyi (University\r\nof California, San Diego), Jean-Pierre Rosay (University of Wisconsin, Madison), Rasul\r\nShafikov (SUNY at Stony Brook), Mei-Chi Shaw (University of Notre Dame), B.\r\nAlan Taylor (University of Michigan), Sophia Vassiliadou (Georgetown University),\r\nBrendan Weickert (Washington and Lee University), Jan Wiegerinck (University of\r\nAmsterdam).\r\nComplex Analysis is an interdisciplinary field involving complex numbers to solve\r\nproblems in mathematics. The conference will explore the interplay of research which\r\nhas taken place in a number of broad areas: Complex Geometry, Complex Dynamics,\r\nPartial Differential Equations and Pluripotential Theory. Many of the developments\r\nin these disciplines found new applications outside their traditional area. We believe\r\nthat hosting such a high level conference will greatly benefit the US mathematicians.\r\nIt is especially helpful in educating our graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s, providing\r\nthem with the opportunity to be in touch with the leading experts working on\r\nthe frontier of the field. We will give special attention to attracting young scientists\r\namong the participants and speakers. A significant part of the conference budget is\r\nallocated especially for this. An effort will be made to increase the number of women\r\nwho will attend the conference. To disseminate the information about the conference\r\nthe organizers created a web site (address: http://web.syr.edu/ dcoman/SCV/),\r\nwhere abstracts of talks and suggested problems will be found.",
