 "awd_abstract_narration": "Privacy and Information Acquisition in Competitive Markets\r\n\r\nRecent years have witnessed dramatic advances in virtually all aspects of \r\ninformation technology including: storage, processing, and \r\ntransmission.  Between 1988 and 2000, the cost of a gigabyte of hard disk \r\nstorage fell from about $11,500 to around a dollar.  Between 1989 and 2000, \r\nthe number of transistors on a standard PC mother board increased by a \r\nfactor of 42.  Between 1990 and 1998, the number of nodes on the Internet \r\nincreased from 313,000 to 29,670,000.  Such innovations in information \r\ntechnology have revolutionized many industries. They have reshaped modern \r\neconomies and profoundly impacted society.  They have given rise to new \r\nmarkets for new goods and services while at the same time spawning new \r\nconcerns regarding questions of public policy.  The question at the heart \r\nof this project concerns the impact of the revolution in information \r\ntechnology on personal privacy.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic advances in information technology occurring over the past 15 \r\nyears have generated both social benefits and costs.  The benefits derive \r\nfrom a more efficient allocation of goods and services and job \r\nassignments.  For example, insurance policies, debt contracts, and \r\napartment leases can be tailored to better fit the characteristics of \r\nprospective customers.  Likewise, employment and college-enrollment offers \r\ncan be better matched with the skills and aptitudes of applicants.  There \r\nare, however, two costs associated with increased information \r\nacquisition.  First, there is obviously a direct resource cost involving \r\nthe collection, storage, and processing of data.  Second, there is a cost \r\nin terms of personal privacy.  Specifically, while consumers and/or \r\nprospective employees are typically willing to divulge some personal \r\ninformation in order to secure more favorable contract terms, firms often \r\ndo not possess incentives for efficient information collection when \r\nscreening their applicants.  In particular, when firms' data-collection \r\nefforts are unobservable (and therefore not contractible), a divergence \r\nbetween the marginal social benefit and marginal private benefit of \r\ninformation acquisition arises.  In environments where information \r\nacquisition corresponds to searching for `bad news' about applicants, the \r\nmarginal private benefit is typically larger, inducing firms to reject too \r\nmany applicants.  By contrast, in environments where information \r\nacquisition corresponds to searching for `good news,' the marginal private \r\nbenefit to screening is lower than the marginal social benefit, and too few \r\napplicants are approved.  Hence, firms have incentives to search too hard \r\nfor bad news about their applicants and not hard enough for good news.\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the economic consequences deriving from this \r\nfundamental divergence between the private and social benefits of \r\ninformation acquisition in a variety of market settings.  Issues such as \r\nthe assignment of privacy rights, price and access discrimination, and the \r\nefficiency of trading relationships will be analyzed.\r\n",
