 "awd_abstract_narration": "LaGuardia Community College is awarding 30 -45 scholarships annually to students majoring in CSEMS eligible subjects.  The amount of the scholarships is dependent upon the individual student's unmet financial need; a consequence is that varying numbers of scholarships are being funded each year.  The student population is 83% minority and 65% female; hence the scholarship program at this institution is increasing the numbers of individuals from these groups entering occupations in which they are traditionally underrepresented.  A pool of over 370 students meets all the requirements (CSEMS major, financial aid and GPA) for receiving a scholarship.  The application and selection process requires a written essay and an interview by the selection committee.\r\nThe institution has excellent student support services that result in a first year retention rate of 65% - somewhat above the national rate.  Included among the support services are student electronic portfolios, the LaGuardia Career and Transfer Center, student mentor program, a supervised internship program, tutorial centers, an employment and career services center, counseling, and the use of learning communities. Student surveys repeatedly have shown a majority of the students dropping out do so because of financial reasons.  With the ability to ameliorate the financial problems with scholarships, the goal of 80% of CSEMS scholars either transferring to senior colleges or graduating with an Associate degree and becoming employed in a CSEMS field after two years of study is being met.  \r\n",
