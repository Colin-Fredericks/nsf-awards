 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to overcome deficiencies in geodynamics software, the geophysics\r\ncommunity has been formulating a plan for Computational Infrastructure for\r\nGeodynamics (CIG), whose purpose will be to leverage the current state of the art in\r\nscientific computing into a suite of toolkits and codes that serve the greater geodynamics\r\ncommunity from pure modelers to users of existing models. The emphasis is on\r\ndeveloping toolkits that ease model development and foster the interchange of ideas and\r\nalgorithms. If successful, this effort promises to revolutionize the way our community\r\ncomputes by providing tools and services that allow us to focus more on the science and\r\nless on the science-neutral parts of high-performance computation. The goal is to\r\nempower a larger community of students, researchers, educators with the tools for\r\nquantitative hypothesis testing.\r\n\r\nIn order to continue to broaden participation from the geophysics community as the\r\nvision for and structure of CIG are finalized and the proposal to fund it are prepared, we\r\npropose to hold a workshop, open to the entire community January 16-17, 2004. By\r\nholding the workshop at this time we are hoping to strike a balance between our desire to\r\nmaintain momentum in the CIG initiative with the need for continued engagement with\r\nthe community. Our objective is for participants to expend as little time as possible\r\ntraveling to the workshop venue. It is for this reason that we propose to hold the two-day\r\nworkshop in a hotel with appropriate conference facilities immediately adjacent to the\r\nLos Angeles International Airport (LAX). Our hope is to have about 50 scientists at the\r\nworkshop with the majority of the participants spread through the computational\r\ngeodynamics community in such a way that we maintain balance between the various sub\r\ndisciplines as well as between junior and senior scientists. In addition, we also plan to\r\ninvite members of the computer science and computational science communities who we\r\nhope to engage in our planning. Their participation will allow the geophysics participants\r\nto better understand how they can take advantage of advances in information technology\r\nand computational science.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The broader impacts of this workshop are likely to be substantial. We\r\nbelieve that this workshop will allow the geophysics community to come together in a\r\nfinal push to advance CIG. CIG will likely alter geophysics by strengthening the\r\ninfrastructure available to all researchers. CIG will also substantially alter the way\r\ngraduate students in computational geophysics are trained in the US.\r\n",
