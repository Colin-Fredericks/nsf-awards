 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe QEM Network will provide technical assistance to grantee and potential grantee institutions to the Foundation's HBCU-UP Program.  Technical assistance will focus on efforts to: (1) enhance the success of potential grantees in securing HBCU-UP support; (2) ensure that newly-funded HBCU-UP projects get off to a strong start; and (3) encourage linkages between and among HBCU-UP Projects as well as linkages to other NSF- funded initiatives.  To help further the overall goal of the HBCU-UP Program, QEM will conduct proposal development workshops; provide on-site technical assistance; conduct special workshops focused on the key components of the HBCU-UP Program; and facilitate communications between and among HBCU-UP grantees as well as with other NSF-funded projects.  QEM will plan and conduct a special two-day faculty workshop during year two that is focused on information, resources, and strategies that support the professional development of undergraduate students majoring in STEM disciplines at HBCU-UP grantee institutions.  QEM also will plan and conduct a two-day STEM faculty development workshop in year three for HBCU-UP multi-year grantee institutions that will focus on research opportunities for faculty, including opportunities at major NSF-funded Research Centers; curricula and pedagogy with an emphasis on the integration of research and teaching; and effective student mentoring. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. \r\nQEM has a successful track record in the conduct and outcome of proposal development workshops. It also has successfully implemented a series of scholarly productivity workshops for faculty at HBCUs and minority-serving institutions that will inform the content of the Student Professional Development Workshop for Faculty and the Faculty Development Workshop.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact. The project will not only reach the total pool of HBCU-UP grantees, it will increase understanding of the HBCU-UP guidelines and NSF application and reporting procedures among HBCUs; improve the quality of STEM curricula, instruction, research opportunities, and student advising/mentoring at HBCUs; strengthen the implementation of HBCU-UP funded projects; and facilitate linkages between HBCUs and NSF-funded Centers. Materials developed through the Project will be widely disseminated to faculty on all HBCU campuses and will be made available at QEM's website. \r\n",
