A combination of theory, experiments, and literature surveys will be used to tackle the problem.  As a result, new paradigms will be developed that will provide researchers with recipes for making better device materials.\r\n\r\nThe theoretical approach is to use sum rules to understand in very general terms those issues that are most important in making an optimized optical material.  While details of the system are not important, certain key parameters such as the first two excited state energies and two or three transition moments are needed to test the validity of the approach.  These will be determined with various linear and nonlinear spectroscopy experiments.  \r\n\r\nPast studies by the PI show that there is a theoretical limit to the nonlinear susceptibility; and, that all molecules ever measured fall below this limit.  Part of this proposal seeks to extend these calculations using sum rules of higher moments and using a non-truncated series to learn if there are perhaps higher limits for different kinds of systems that may be exploited.  For example, previous work considered mostly the diagonal tensor components of the nonlinear susceptibilities.  A large part of the theoretical aspects of this work will be to develop a full set of non-diagonal sum rules and apply them to three dimensional systems to determine if this may be a fruitful avenue for larger nonlinearities.\r\n\r\nA central theme of the theoretical studies will be to understand systems in which the nonlinear response can be amplified by using novel composite structures, such as metal intensifiers, quantum local field models, and symmetries in three dimensional molecules.  While there is a separate large body of literature on each of these material concepts, the sum rules will provide guiding principles in putting together the pieces in the most optimal manner.  Furthermore, for each technology, the sum rules will be used to calculate the limits of the appropriate device figure of merit.\r\n\r\nExperiments such as linear absorption spectroscopy, electroabsorption spectroscopy, and excited state fluorescence will be used to characterize the quantum states of the molecules, which will serve as a test of the validity of the calculations on the microscopic level.  In addition to new molecules produced in collaboration with other researchers, known molecules will be characterized with our measurement techniques and theory.  This set of results will be applied to determine which molecule attributes have the largest impact on the nonlinear response.\r\n\r\n(1) Intellectual Merit:  Using a mix of experiments and theory, this proposal applies very fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics to understand the performance limit of optical device materials.  The proposed studies will guide chemists in designing new materials, provide new paradigms for physicists/materials scientists in making new structures, and engineers to develop novel devices.  It should be stressed that the sum rules apply to all materials.  While the focus is on organics because of the vast number of materials that can be engineered, this research will also impact inorganic systems.\r\n\r\n(2) Broader impact: Washington State University is located at the border of Eastern Washington and Western Idaho.  This is a rural area with economically disadvantaged residents, Indian Reservations (the nearest two are the Nez Perce and the Coeur D'Alene reservations), as well as children of migrant farm laborers with a large proportion of Latinos, Native Americans, and other under-represented groups.  These will be the groups targeted by the outreach program.  Students and teachers will be exposed to this research; and, software will be provided to the schools so that they can participate in data analysis.    As far as technical breadth, the fundamental science proposed underlies a broad range of optical technologies and all material classes.  Areas impacted include telecommunications, computing, displays, memory, and sensors - any applications that operate based on light interacting with a material.\r\n\r\nThis award is jointly supported by the Division of Electrical and Communications Systems and the Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
