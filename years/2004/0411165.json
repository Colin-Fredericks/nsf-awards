 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is aiming at solving polynomial systems numerically by the\r\nhomotopy continuation method. Over the years, practical evidences have been\r\ngiven that the homotopy method is efficient, reliable and much powerful in\r\nsolving polynomial systems. Recently, modeling the sparse structure of a\r\npolynomial system by its Newton polytopes leads to a major computational\r\nbreakthrough called the polyhedral homotopy method. Based on it, a source\r\ncode HOM4PS, produced by the PI and his students, leads all the other\r\nexisting codes for solving polynomial systems in efficiency and storage\r\nrequirement by a great margin. Nonetheless, there are numerous models of\r\nlarge polynomial systems in application still do not have a satisfactory\r\nline of attack. And it has become apparent that the numerical techniques for\r\nfollowing homotopy paths are far from thoroughly developed for large\r\nsystems. The essence of the project is the advance development in all\r\naspects of the solver HOM4PS based on the conduct of further research to\r\ngreatly enlarge the scope of its applications, especially applications to\r\nlarge systems.\r\n\r\nThe problem of solving polynomial systems arises very frequently in various\r\nfields of science and engineering, such as formula construction, geometric\r\nintersection, inverse kinematics, robotics, power flow problems with\r\nPQ-specified bases, vision and the computation of equilibrium states of\r\nchemical reaction equations, etc. This topic has been an important research\r\nsubjectin Europe. In the last decade, a considerable research effort\r\ninvolving seven countries and twenty universities had been directed to this\r\nproblem in two consecutive major projects, PoSSo and FRISCO, supported by\r\nEuropean Commission. As mentioned above, the code HOM4PS developed by the PI\r\nfor this problem is far more advanced and the ultimate goal of the current\r\nproject is a more complete high-quality block-box software which will\r\nincorporate the best state of the art to provide the general scientific\r\ncommunity a reliable source for solving polynomial systems on a wide variety\r\nof advanced architectures.\r\n",
