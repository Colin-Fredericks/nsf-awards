 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objectives of the proposed research are to design, analyze,\r\nand implement accurate, robust, and efficient numerical methods for\r\npartial differential equations which model complex multiscale\r\nmultiphysics systems arising in science and engineering\r\napplications. In particular, the research will focus on several\r\ncritical components of the mathematical and numerical modeling of\r\ncoupled free fluid and porous media flows: identification of a correct\r\nmathematical model, especially appropriate interface conditions,\r\nanalysis of the well-posedness of the model, design and analysis of\r\nstable and accurate numerical discretization methods, including finite\r\nelement methods on non-matching grids, interior convergence and\r\npostprocessing, and a posteriori error estimation and adaptivity, and\r\ndevelopment of efficient solution algorithms such as parallel domain\r\ndecomposition and Newton-Krylov-multigrid solvers and preconditioners.\r\n\r\nThe numerical techniques to be developed in this research are general\r\nand address fundamental questions of numerical analysis of partial\r\ndifferential equations. Applications to coupling of groundwater and\r\nsurface water flows, as well as modeling of the cardiovascular system\r\nwill be emphasized.  Computer modeling of subsurface and surface flow\r\nand transport can provide reliable and cost-effective solutions to\r\nenvironmental and energy problems such as contaminant surface water\r\nand groundwater remediation and enhanced oil recovery. Current\r\nsimulators do not take into account the complex multiscale interaction\r\nbetween subsurface and surface geosystems. This research will model\r\nthis interaction, which is crucial for the accurate prediction of\r\nfluid behavior. The research will result in the development of robust\r\nand flexible software tools for performing accurate realistic\r\nmultiprocessor simulations of contaminant remediation of wetlands,\r\nlakes and estuaries.  Mathematical and computational modeling of the\r\ncardiovascular system is a relatively new but rapidly growing area of\r\nresearch. This application has a vast importance to society. For\r\nexample, the heart attacks and strokes that result from\r\natherosclerosis are the major cause of death in industrial\r\nnations. The aim of the proposed research in this area is to model\r\ncomputationally atherosclerosis taking into account the recently\r\ndiscovered, but critical effect of inflammation. Coupled macroscopic\r\nmodels of blood flow within the artery and its wall will be combined\r\nwith cellular level models of acute inflammatory response. The\r\nresearch will lead to the development of optimized simulation tools\r\nwhich will advance prevention, detection, and therapy of\r\natherosclerosis.\r\n",
