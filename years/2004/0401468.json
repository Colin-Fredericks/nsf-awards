 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF proposal: ``Division algebras and field invariants''\r\nP.I.: David J. Saltman\r\n\r\nFractions of integers, which we all learned about in the early grades,\r\nform a system called a ``field''. But this field is not large enough,\r\nsince in this so called ``rational'' field you cannot take the square\r\nroot of 2, or write down pi. It has become, therefore, a truism that we\r\nneed to study all fields. But even the study of all fields is not\r\nencompassing enough, because in physics, or when using matrices, one\r\nfinds one must study objects which are field-like, but which are\r\nnoncommutative, meaning A times B might not equal B times A. Such\r\nobjects are called division algebras. The question, in the largest\r\nsense, that this grant considers is the classification of all division\r\nalgebras in terms of the better understood fields, with particular\r\nreference to the ``center'' of the division algebra, which is inside\r\nthe division algebra and is a field. Coupled with the center is the\r\n``degree'' of a division algebra, which is a positive integer that\r\nmeasures how much bigger the division algebras is as compared to its\r\ncenter. Division algebras are an old subject, with a great deal of\r\ninformation known when the center is one dimensional. For example when\r\nthe center is close to the rational field, any division algebra is\r\nknown to be so called ``cyclic'', which means there is a very good\r\ndescription in terms of fields. The focus of this proposal is the study\r\nof division algebras whose centers have dimension 2. For example, a\r\nmajor focus is the case where the center comes from a curve over a\r\np-adic field, a very special case of a 2 dimensional field. In this\r\ncase, not all division algebras are cyclic, but the proposers hopes to\r\nuse algebraic geometry to show that when the division algebra has\r\ndegree a prime integer, and the center comes from a p-adic curve, then\r\ncyclicity does hold.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important tool in studying division algebras is Galois\r\ncohomology, because the set of all division algebras with fixed center\r\nF form a group isomorphic to the second Galois cohomology group with\r\nunit coefficients. Since second cohomology can be hard to compute,\r\noften one attacks this group by using ramification. In more detail, any\r\ndiscrete valuation defines a map to a first cohomology group, and by\r\nusing all possible discrete valuations one hopes to capture the\r\ndivision algebras. In special cases this is known to work, for example\r\nfor rational field or the fields arising from p-adic curves. In both\r\ncases, one shows, or hopes to show, cyclicity by showing there is a\r\ncyclic Galois extension which splits all the ramification of the\r\ndivision algebra. This leads to a more fundamental question. If D is a\r\ndivision algebra of prime degree, is there always a cyclic field\r\nextension, of the same degree, which at least splits all the\r\nramification?\r\n",
