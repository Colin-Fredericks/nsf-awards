 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Protein Data Bank (PDB) is the single international repository and primary source for information about the structure of biological macromolecules. As such, it is a key research resource and a central component to our understanding of living systems. The PDB serves a broad community of experimental, structural and computational scientists and serves as a resource for educators at all levels.  PDB access is provided through primary web and ftp sites (www.pdb.org, ftp.pdb.org) or via 7 mirror sites distributed worldwide.  The goal of the Research Collaboratory for Structural Biology (RCSB) in managing PDB is to provide a single, searchable archive of accurate and well-annotated data on experimentally determined macromolecular structure.  Systems developed by RCSB are currently being used for data processing, archiving, distribution and query, as well as maintenance of the physical archive. In the current project period, new activities are planned as follows. First, data processing is being improved by increasing accuracy and speed of processing, ensuring that the entire archive is as uniform and error free as possible, and creating the infrastructure to support automated data deposition and exchange functions. Second, data archiving, distribution and query capabilities are being improved by implementing a new system for distribution and archiving of all PDB data, and enabling comprehensive structural data analyses regardless of geographic location, local hardware, or software configuration.  Finally, completion and maintenance of a comprehensive physical archive is being undertaken to ensure the preservation of primary data and of all records associated with the transactions of the database including documents describing its evolution and maintenance.  The result of this effort will be a significant improvement in the utility and value of the Protein Data Bank for both specialists and non-specialists alike. \r\n\r\nMechanisms for increasing the broader impacts of this work include the following:  a series of workshops and meeting sessions, active participation in scientific meetings, a regular newsletter, the on-going use of a help desk to increase the access and utility of PDB for the specialist and non-specialist research community, and use of focus groups to insure maximum usability of PDB data. Participation in graduate and undergraduate coursework design and implementation and in structured research opportunities is being used to increase the impact of PDB on university-level education.  Participation in teacher training workshops and a collaborative effort to launch a teacher development program provide opportunities to bring PDB resources to the K/12 environment.  The general public is being made aware of PDB efforts through a traveling art exhibit and through frequent news releases and informational programs.  Collectively, these efforts will extend the benefits of PDB resources and activities to the broadest possible community.\r\n\r\n",
