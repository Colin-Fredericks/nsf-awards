 "awd_abstract_narration": "This objective of this research is to develop a highly exploratory \r\nnon-lithographic approach to fabricate room-temperature single-electron \r\ntransistors based on chemically synthesized metallic nanoparticles of \r\ncontrollable sizes and shapes. The approach is based on controlled \r\nmanipulation and assembly of colloidal nanoparticles assisted by a \r\nnonuniform electric field. The proposed approach is unique in that the \r\nnanoparticles are used to form not only the central conducting islands \r\nwhich allow room-temperature operation, but also metallic interconnects to \r\nconnect the central islands to conventional structures without the need of \r\nhigh-resolution lithography. The approach also allows for the fabrication \r\nof suspended single-electron transistor structure, which may address the \r\nproblem of random background charges.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed work could lead to true breakthroughs in the \r\nfabrication technology of practical single-electron devices, which are \r\nidentified in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors as \r\npossible alternatives to metal-oxide-semiconductors field-effect \r\ntransistors, which will soon run into fundamental physical scaling limits, \r\nfor future memory and logic applications. The project will also provide the \r\nstudents with excellent research and educational opportunities in \r\nnanoscience and nanotechnology. The highly interdisciplinary nature of the \r\nresearch will result in broad training of students. The research project is \r\nwell suited for undergraduate students at all levels to participate. \r\nParticular effort will be made to involve minority students.\r\n",
