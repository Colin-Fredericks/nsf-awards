 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop a new generation of calcium phosphate coatings for dental and orthopedic implants, in which film characterization is optimized, for enhanced bioactivity, and adhesion to the surrounding tissues for promotion of the coating lifetime and faster relief of the patient. The approach is to process a functionally graded hydroxyapatite (HA) coating with and without Yttrium doping. \r\n\r\nYttrium can cause an increase in initial absorption of calcium in the body leading to select protein adsorption to enhance bone cell function. The graded crystallinity nature of the coating can improve bonding strength between implant and bone so that a patient who has received joint or dental replacement surgery may quickly return to a normal lifestyle. It aims to increase the service-life of an implant by creating materials that form a strong, long lasting, bond with bone. This can decrease the need for implant replacement mainly for younger patients with the potential of using an implant for longer period of time. Undoubtedly, design criteria used in the proposed study to investigate new coating techniques coupled with a new coating material can have great impact in the development of the next generation of orthopedic and dental implants with an improved ability to bind to juxtaposed bone and durability.  The education plan involves: interdisciplinary research that can benefit the students to work and learn from both parties, PI will continue developing her new graduate course including Biomaterials, undergraduate students will become involved through undergraduate research elective course and the special attempts to recruit underrepresented and/or female student.",
