 "awd_abstract_narration": "This planning project is creating the basis for a new National Resource Center in Materials Technology Education. The program is based on the needs of industry for qualified and trained technicians who understand the basics of materials technology. This is especially important relative to new developments in nanotechnology and composites technologies as well as in structural manufacture and electronics processing and the future need for recycling of all materials systems (ISO 14000). It builds on prior ATE projects in materials technology education, and on current community college educational programs.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to develop a curriculum clearinghouse for the broad range of materials as they apply to manufacturing and engineering technology, and to provide the professional development and support needed for instructors to adequately treat the subject of materials technology in their courses. The focus of the program is on enhanced education for manufacturing technicians who handle materials in structural and electronics manufacturing. The expected outcomes of this project include enhanced curricular modules aligned with industry-based core competencies to provide student education aligned with industry needs, and model programs on how to insert these modules into typical manufacturing and engineering technology courses. Also expected are a set of well-trained instructors at high school and community college levels in this area, and a growing alliance of colleges, schools and industry working to further develop these outcomes. The development of new roles for professional societies and industry in delivering courses and providing mentorships are also included. The planning group for this National Resource Center includes community colleges, industry, professional societies, national laboratories, 4-year colleges and universities, and school district partners nation-wide.\r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of this project is based on the development of curriculum that will assist teachers in motivating their students using creative, student centered teaching materials, followed by a quality program leading to technology careers. Educational research and education are integrated in this program, which provides for student participation, mentoring and dissemination of effective models for student recruiting and retention in manufacturing technology. The planning project build on the wide base of curricula collected at Edmonds and elsewhere in materials technology as a result of past and current programs, and on modular curricula developed by other ATE Centers and projects, filling gaps related to materials technology. Strong institutional support provides for sustainability of the program.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impact focuses on the current and future needs of manufacturing technicians as related to the materials they use. It also includes the development of enhanced industry-school partnerships through use of interactions with professional societies, which will provide mentoring, internship and networking opportunities for students, teachers and professionals. The Center's curricular programs have a strong focus on addressing the needs of groups underrepresented in technology. Broad dissemination of the products of the Center through professional societies and educational organizations enhance student enrollment in manufacturing, engineering and materials programs and the numbers of students available to enter the workforce in this critical area.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
