 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science and Mathematics for All (SMA) is a Howard University School of Education and College of Arts and Sciences scholarship program funded by the National Science Foundation.   The program is ameliorating the shortage of qualified science and mathematics teachers in urban, high-need areas by producing thirty teachers with exceptional content knowledge in mathematics and the sciences.  The SMA program recruits qualified graduate students who earned undergraduate degrees in the sciences or mathematics and who are dedicated to teaching in high need schools in Prince George's County Public Schools (PGCPS). These graduate students receive intensive summer training toward certification, are paid tuition for twenty-one credit hours towards a Master of Arts in Teaching degree at Howard University School of Education, and commit to a two-year teaching contract with the partnering school district, PGCPS.  SMA also provides extensive induction support for new teachers including in-school mentors and Howard University faculty mentors.",
