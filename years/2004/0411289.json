 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  Spectroscopic methods, such as fluorescence, are used in diverse areas of chemical sciences to investigate chemical structure, molecular interactions, optical properties, biomolecular structure and function, kinetics, bioassays, and many other applications. By implementing the use of a fluorescence spectrophotometer, the integration of fluorescence spectroscopy throughout our undergraduate chemistry and biochemistry curricula is significantly enhancing the students' learning experience by 1) using modern instrumentation to develop practical skills in acquiring spectroscopic data and 2) using meaningful data to demonstrate the principles of spectroscopy and thereby helping students comprehend spectroscopic theory and the quantum mechanical basis of energy transitions. By exposing students to fluorescence and spectroscopic concepts throughout their college careers, students are expected to retain their knowledge of spectroscopic concepts, which will enable them to better apply this knowledge to scientific problems in the future.  This project also is an essential component in Departmental efforts to modernize the undergraduate laboratories and implement project-based exercises. Fluorescence spectroscopy is being integrated into the following lower and upper division courses: general, analytical, instrumental, physical, and bio-chemistry. Our plans include the adaptation and implementation of  fluorescence-based experiments from the primary research literature or from the Journal of Chemical Education, along with the development of new laboratory modules that emphasize basic spectroscopic theory and the complementary nature of many analytical techniques. The fluorometer also is being used in faculty-directed undergraduate research projects that students are encouraged to begin as early as their sophomore year. The fluorometer is centrally located in the Department's instrument laboratory and is made available to other departments via Western Washington University's (WWU's) Integrated Laboratory Network (ILN). The ILN is a computer network that enables remote access to instruments, software, on-line instrument tutorials, and data files. \r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nA fundamental understanding of spectroscopic methods and their applications is essential for physical scientists. This project addresses this need by implementing interdisciplinary and project-based laboratory exercises throughout the chemistry and biochemistry curricula. \r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe acquisition of the fluorometer significantly enhances the Department's and WWU's infrastructure for undergraduate research and education. The incorporation of fluorescence and molecular spectroscopy in the lower-division chemistry courses is impacting a diverse group of students, many of whom are not chemistry majors. The implementation of project-based, interdisciplinary experiments presents a more realistic picture of scientific discovery to students, and demonstrates the relevance and significance of scientific research. Experiments and methods developed as part of this project will be disseminated via the internet and in the chemical education literature. \r\n",
