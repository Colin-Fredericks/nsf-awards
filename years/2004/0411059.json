The structural testing frame fabricated as part of this project is providing the means to conduct experiments on steel, concrete and timber structural elements. These experiments and the associated educational activities are significantly improving the undergraduate civil engineering curriculum, encouraging student interaction, cultivating student creativity, and bridging student connectivity between theoretical concepts and hands-on experience. The project is improving student retention rates, particularly among students from underrepresented groups.  The equipment and associated experiments are bringing students from different concentration areas, mainly structural engineering, construction management, and geo-technical engineering together, and providing interdisciplinary interaction and engagement.  This interdisciplinary learning environment is encouraging students to explore projects within various concentration areas.",
