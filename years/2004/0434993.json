 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academy of Engineering (NAE) will convene a workshop to examine .offshoring. of \r\nengineering content.the relocation of U.S.-based engineering jobs to other countries by moving key units of \r\nU.S.-owned companies abroad or contracting with overseas product and service providers.  This examination is intended to improve our understanding of the scope, composition, and motivation for offshoring and to consider the implications for the future of U.S. engineering practice, labor markets, education, and research.  The workshop will bring together analysts from government statistical agencies (NSF, BEA/Census, and others), experts from engineering professional societies, industry, and academia who have collected data and can offer insights into the issues and implications of offshoring, especially to leaders in engineering education. NAE President Wm. A. Wulf will appoint a small steering committee that will include experts in \r\nengineering practice from multiple sectors and fields, labor market analysis, engineering education, as well as experts in industrial organization and international trade, investment, and technology flow.  The committee will plan the workshop, identify salient issues and speakers, and prepare a report on the workshop for distribution.",
