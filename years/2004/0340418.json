 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)Phase I project proposes to explore the feasibility of creating a new method for analyzing and evaluating free-form student responses within computer-based assessment and tutorial systems for mathematics.  This research will apply new XML technologies in an attempt to evaluate a student's mathematics understanding at a much deeper level than is possible with existing computer-based assessment systems, which will lead to improved assessment reporting and adaptation of mathematics curricula.  The proposed method for implementing mathematics assessment not only represents an innovative application of XML technologies to a significant problem in education, namely mathematics assessment; it also proposes a new specification that can be used to supplement emerging standards in computer-based learning and interoperability.\r\n\r\nTraditional standardized assessment methodologies have been criticized for the low level of skills they evaluate. Improved assessment methods are necessary in order to adapt mathematics instruction to the needs of individual students. The proposed research will also demonstrate that XML technologies can address a range of applications much broader than e-commerce and web publishing.\r\n",
