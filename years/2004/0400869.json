The PI\r\nwill study mainly inverse problems of recovering a Riemannian metric from\r\nboundary or inverse scattering data. The central problem is the boundary\r\nrigidity problem for Riemannian metrics (called also inverse kinematic\r\nproblem),  where one has to recover a Riemannian metric in a bounded domain\r\nfrom the lengths of geodesics connecting every two boundary points. This\r\nproblem is closely connected to the inverse problem of recovering a metric\r\nfrom the associated hyperbolic Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DN) map on the\r\nboundary, and also to an associated inverse spectral problem. The PI plans\r\nto study the problem of generic uniqueness for simple metrics and stability\r\nestimates. Related problems in integral geometry will be studied, like the\r\nlinearized problem: recovery of tensors from integrals along geodesics and\r\nstability estimates. The PI will also work on the elliptic anisotropic\r\ninverse boundary value problem, the inverse backscattering problem for the\r\nacoustic equation, and related inverse problems where one has to recover the\r\ncoefficients of the principal symbol of the differential operator from\r\nboundary or scattering data. In the area of Resonance Theory, the proposer\r\nplans to study the location and asymptotic distribution of resonances for\r\nvarious systems. Both scattering systems and semi-classical Schroedinger\r\ntype of equations  will be considered. Among the problems that will be\r\nstudied are sharp upper bounds of the number of resonances in a disk or\r\nsector in the complex plane, upper and lower bounds connected with various\r\ncharacteristics of the trapped sets of the associated classical mechanics\r\nproblem. Mathematical justification of numerical methods for computing\r\nresonances will be also considered. The properties of the scattering\r\namplitude near resonances will be studied as well, which is related to the\r\nproblem of observability of resonances. \r\n\r\nInverse Problems, and in particular the problems in this proposal, is a\r\nmathematical tool of great importance to other sciences. Applications are\r\nnumerous: they are used in medicine for imaging the internal structure of a\r\nhuman body and for medical diagnostics, in non-destructive material testing,\r\nin geophysics for obtaining information about the inner structure of the\r\nearth from seismic waves, in oil exploration, etc. Riemannian metric models\r\nanisotropic media, where the speed of wave propagation may depend not only\r\non the position but also on the direction. The boundary rigidity problem is\r\nof interest not only to scattering theory but also to Riemannian geometry,\r\nits linearized version is a problem of independent interest in integral\r\ngeometry as a generalized Radon transform. Resonance Theory is part of\r\nScattering Theory for quantum mechanical and wave equation type of systems\r\nin unbounded domains. Resonances are certain frequencies that can be\r\nobserved in a variety of situations in Quantum Chemistry, Physics,\r\nAcoustics, etc. Besides being motivated by applications in other natural\r\nsciences, Resonance Theory uses tools from and encourages further\r\ndevelopment of mathematics areas as Microlocal Analysis, Dynamical Systems,\r\nand Geometry. \r\n",
