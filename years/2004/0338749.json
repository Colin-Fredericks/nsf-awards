 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project tests a model of motivation and openness to, versus defensiveness against, ongoing events.  The model examines three types of motivation that are described by Self-Determination Theory -- autonomous, control-oriented, and impersonal motivation.  Autonomy motivation refers to the tendency to initiate behavior out of choices that are based on an awareness of one's feelings and values.  It is accompanied by genuine self-esteem and a sense of self that is \"integrated\" in the sense that self-aspects are consistent with each other and with intrinsic needs.  In contrast, control motivation describes the tendency to experience events as pressures that determine behavior and feelings.  It is associated with self-esteem that is contingent on external outcomes, and a sense of self that is \"ego-invested\" in that it is strongly based on external feedback and image.  Finally, impersonal motivation is the tendency to experience desired outcomes as unattainable, display little sense of intentionality, lack either type of self-esteem, and to have an incoherent sense of self that lacks integration.  The model to be tested holds that to the extent that individuals are autonomously motivated, they can experience ongoing events as they are, without using distortion or defenses such as biases and justifications. This openness allows optimal responding in situations that are continually changing, and facilitates performance.  In contrast, under control motivation, individuals must defend against events that do not support the ego-invested sense of self by the use of distorting biases. This limits individuals' ability to respond to changing events, and undermines performance.  Finally, impersonal motivation leads to defensiveness that is inconsistent and ineffective, high negative affect, and the worst performance of all.  Five studies will use multiple methods to provide causal tests of the model.  The supported model would call into question the assumption underlying some previous social psychological research that defense is advantageous for functioning, or at the very least, normative.  Rather, support for the hypotheses would suggest that the openness to experience that is allowed by autonomy motivation facilitates performance. The results also would provide further evidence that autonomy support by teachers, parents, employers, and coaches is critical for the performance of students, children, employees, and athletes.  The project will contribute significantly to the scientific training of undergraduates, and will expose socioeconomically disadvantaged high school students to science.",
