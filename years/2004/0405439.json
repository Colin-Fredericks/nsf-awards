 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nLenci\r\n\r\nThis research project consists of three parts: Part I deals with\r\nbilliards on non-compact tables, as models for hyperbolic dynamical\r\nsystems with an infinite invariant measure. The plan is to extend\r\nto these dynamical systems certain important results available for compact \r\nbilliards, including a suitable version of Pesin's Theory. This will require \r\nthe rewriting of some notions of ergodic theory for the case of a \r\nnon-probability measure. Part II concerns random billiards; more precisely, \r\nbilliards with a random table (changing after each collision), a quenched \r\nrandom table (selected once and for all from a random ensemble), or a random \r\nlaw of reflection (in a fixed table). In the first two cases there is a \r\nphysical invariant measure, and the PI will study its ergodic properties \r\n(including Lyapunov exponents and the like) for a typical realization of the \r\nrandom process. In the third case an equilibrium measure can be shown to \r\nexist, and its asymptotic properties will be investigated, together with the \r\nnatural question of the stochastic stability at the zero-noise limit. \r\nSimilar perturbative questions are considered for the other systems as well. \r\nPart III, in the realm of equilibrium statistical mechanics, considers the \r\nquestion of quantum large deviations. In a collaborative project, the PI \r\nsets out to initiate a theory of large deviations for a noncommutative \r\nquasi-local algebra on a d-dimensional lattice. Of primary interest is the \r\nconvergence of the moment-generating function for an extensive observable, \r\nand the smoothness and physical significance of its limit.\r\n\r\nBilliards are a class of dynamical systems that has been most\r\nextensively studied. This is so for a two-fold reason: On one hand,\r\nmathematically, they are relatively treatable, with their geometric\r\nfeatures often giving hints on how to prove a certain sought\r\nresult. On the other hand, from the point of view of physics, they are\r\nfairly realistic models that have been applied to a variety of fields,\r\nfrom statistical mechanics to optics to scattering theory. Therefore the \r\ndrive is natural to expand this class to cover new areas where it could have \r\na remarkable impact: the family of open systems (every system with unbounded \r\ndynamics belongs to this category) and of random systems (which tries to \r\njustify when, and why, deterministic predictions still make sense in a noisy \r\nworld). As for Part III, the theory of large deviations in statistical \r\nmechanics gives a theoretical understanding of the fact that large systems, \r\nwhich are deeply random from the observer's standpoint, yield nonetheless \r\nvery accurate deterministic measurements. Although large deviations for \r\nclassical systems have been the subject of massive and very successful \r\nresearch, a counterpart of quantum system (which should rightfully be even \r\nmore fundamental) is conspicuously missing at the moment. \r\n\r\n",
