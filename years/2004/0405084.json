The PI is\r\nparticularly interested in giving precise quantitative descriptions of\r\nthese singularities. Such descriptions must generally be given in\r\nterms of so-called \"matched asymptotic expansions.\" Methods for\r\ncomputing such expansions are known in applied mathematics, but there\r\nis a shortage of techniques for proving the validity of the computed\r\nexpansions (when they actuallly are valid).\r\n\r\nThe PI has in the past given rigorous asymptotic descriptions for a\r\nnumber of nonlinear heat flows (curve shortening, mean curvature\r\nflow). In the current proposal the PI mentions a number of new\r\nproblems which he would like to study. These new problems are on one\r\nhand similar to the previously studied problems, but on the other hand\r\nthe old methods don't seem directly applicable. In addition, much of\r\nthe previous work was in a sense \"one-dimensional\" in that symmetry\r\nassumptions were used to simplify the situation. In the next few years\r\nthe PI would like to address less symmetric problems, to see if the\r\nmatched asymptotic expansions can also be obtained in truly higher\r\ndimensional settings.\r\n\r\nApart from his interest in pure mathematics, the PI is also involved\r\nin a collaboration with biomedical engineers, in which mathematical\r\nproblems related to differential geometry and PDE in Medical Imaging\r\nare addressed.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: Due to his interest in medical imaging, the PI serves\r\nas a resource for biomedical engineers (both his collaborators who are\r\noff campus, and the medical engineering faculty & grad students on the\r\nUW Madison campus). Knowledge of newer applications of differential\r\ngeometry in medical imaging and computer vision enhances the PI's\r\nundergraduate classes (e.g. the planned creation of an advanced\r\nundergraduate course on mathematical methods of medical imaging) and\r\nin the long run inspires new problems in pure mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t",
