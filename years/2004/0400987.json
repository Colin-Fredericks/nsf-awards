 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Purpose of the project is to support research in operator algebras and \r\nrelated fields. Operator algebras provide models and tools for the study \r\nof noncommutative, or quantized systems and objects. A large part of the \r\nsubject is the study of von Neumann algebras (introduced by John von \r\nNeumann about seventy years ago). These are the noncommutative measure \r\nspaces. The research objective of the project is to further develop the \r\ntheory of quantum (or \"free\") probability and statistics in the context of \r\nvon Neumann algebras and find applications in mathematics and beyond.\r\n\r\nProbabilistic and statistical methods are widely used in many areas of \r\nsciences and in our daily lives. For many complicated systems such as \r\nfinancial markets or networks, classical theories are not quite \r\neffective in explaining how the systems work and predicting the future. \r\nQuantum probability and statistics provide tools in dealing with large \r\nsystems with more interactive or intertwined variables. Progresses in the \r\nstudy of quantum probability and statistics will enhance our understanding \r\nof the laws in nature and the quality of our living.\r\n",
