 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to support both research and education outreach at The University of Kansas (KU). The KU experimental particle physics group proposes a broad-based program of research through their involvement in the DZero Experiment, which is now taking proton-antiproton collision data at the Fermilab Tevatron, and in the CLEO Experiment, which is now taking electron-positron collision data at the Cornell CESR facility. DZero analyses being pursued include measurements of the W-to-Z cross section ratio, W b b-bar cross section, and single top cross section; an investigation of events with missing energy, and a Higgs-inspired study of tau-pair production. DZero is taking data at the highest energy and the potential for an important discovery with this experiment is great. For example, a large single top or Higgs to tau-pair cross section could be a signal for physics beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry. With CLEO, the group will continue publishing physics analyses done by its undergraduate researchers. The KU group has published five CLEO journal articles with undergraduate principal authors and has several ongoing analyses that will be pursued in this project. This work mainly focuses on photon decays of the narrow Upsilon resonances, a rich area of physics where CLEO maintains the best data sample. Once the CLEO-c program accumulates sufficient data near the charm threshold, the group will study direct photon production from charmonium. The KU group is building the CMS detector and doing development work for a linear collider detector. With CMS, the group uses expertise gained with the DZero silicon detector to help the U.S. effort on the silicon tracker outer-barrel detector. The KU group maintains test stands and testing oversight at Fermilab. It will assist in the commissioning of the detector during the final year of this proposal. CMS is scheduled to begin taking data near the end of this proposal period. Linear collider detector R&D will focus on studying calorimetry options. \r\n\r\nIn the education/outreach area, the PIs are committed to 1) the continuation of our QuarkNet center, now in its fourth year, that fosters research and education projects with area high school physics teachers and 2) the production of an educational cartoon that will teach school children about the various types of quarks and leptons by giving each a memorable animated personality. Smaller outreach projects include participation in university open house events and helping with science shows for grade school children. The research program is well suited to the training of students at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels. By having projects with data to analyze, projects being built, and projects being designed, the group can give its students a full range of training in the experimental discipline. The KU group maintains its record of disseminating research findings via the Internet with web sites aimed at different communities. \r\n\r\n",
