Galloway\r\n\r\nRecent developments in gravitational theory, both theoretical and\r\nempirical, have lead to an increased interest in the study of\r\nasymptotically anti-de Sitter and asymptotically de Sitter\r\nspacetimes. In this project, techniques of Lorentzian and\r\nRiemannian geometry will be used to attack certain problems\r\npertaining to such spacetimes, as well as some problems\r\nconcerning new developments in the theory of black holes. One of\r\nthe specific aims of this project is to continue development of\r\nan approach to establishing positivity of mass for asymptotically\r\nhyperbolic Riemannian manifolds (with spherical conformal\r\ninfinity) which does not require spin assumption. This approach,\r\nwhich makes use of the brane action introduced by Witten and Yau\r\nin their work on the AdS/CFT correspondence, may also be useful\r\nin settling some positive mass conjectures for asymptotically\r\nanti-de Sitter spacetimes with toroidal topology at infinity. The\r\nPI also plans to continue investigations into uniqueness and\r\nrigidity phenomena, and the development of singularities in\r\nasymptotically de Sitter spacetimes.  The classical definition of\r\na black hole, though mathematically elegant, is problematic in\r\npractice (especially for numerical studies) in that it requires\r\nknowing the full future evolution of spacetime all the way to\r\ninfinity.  As an alternative, Ashtekar and Krishnan have\r\nintroduced a new, fully nonlinear and dynamical, approach to the\r\nstudy of black holes, based on the quasi-local notion of a\r\ndynamical horizon. Another aim of this project is to investigate\r\nsome open problems concerning the occurence, i.e., existence,\r\nuniqueness and position of dynamical horizons.\r\n\r\nModern theories of gravity are geometrical in nature. The\r\ngravitational field and other fields, black holes and related\r\nobjects, may be described and analyzed using geometric methods.\r\nIn more general terms, this project is concerned with the study\r\nof certain features of gravity of current scientific interest\r\nfrom this geometric point of view, utilizing the tools of\r\nRiemannian geometry, a mathematical theory of space, and\r\nLorentzian geometry, a mathematical theory of spacetime. These\r\ntheories provide a method for studying the relationship among\r\nthree fundamental aspects of the spacetime universe: curvature\r\n(i.e., the bending of space or spacetime), topology (i.e., the\r\nglobal shape and complexity of space or spacetime) and causal\r\nstructure (i.e., the large scale behavior of light rays and\r\nlight cones).",
