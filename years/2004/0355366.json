 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the last few decades, the introduction of reactive nitrogen (N) into the \r\nbiosphere by food and energy production has been greater than rates of N fixation in native \r\nterrestrial ecosystems.  By far the largest uncertainty about the human domination of the N \r\ncycle on all scales is the amount of reactive N that is converted back to N2 during the last step \r\nof denitrification.  Without this knowledge, it is impossible to determine the rate of \r\naccumulation of reactive N in most environmental reservoirs, and thus impossible to assess its \r\nlong-term consequences.  Nitrogen interacts with carbon and other nutrient cycles and has \r\nnumerous cascading effects on water and air quality and climate.  An improved understanding \r\nof where, when, and how much reactive N is denitrified could contribute to finding solutions \r\nto the problems created by excessive reactive N in the environment. \r\n \r\nUnfortunately, we have little knowledge about rates of denitrification across \r\nlandscapes and waterscapes.  We know the environmental conditions under which \r\ndenitrification occurs, but reliable quantification of N2 production in the field is still relatively \r\nrare.  There are three primary reasons for lack of knowledge about N2 production: (1) it is \r\ndifficult to measure due to the high atmospheric background concentrations; (2) N2 \r\nproduction rates are very heterogeneous in space and time; and (3) there is a lack of synergy \r\nbetween the scientific communities that determine N2 production rates.  \r\n \r\nWe propose holding a 3-day workshop in May 2004 of about 35 participants to focus \r\non quantification of N2 production via biological denitrification.  The objectives of this \r\nworkshop will be: (1) to evaluate the state of our knowledge of denitrification rates in a wide \r\nrange of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; (2) to compare methodologies that have been \r\nadopted by different scientific disciplines, with the expectation that collaborations across \r\ndisciplines could yield methodological advances; and (3) to chart out the current weaknesses \r\nand the actions needed to address those weaknesses for an improved global assessment of \r\nwhere, when, and how much reactive N is converted to N2 in the biosphere.  Two important \r\nconsiderations will be superimposed over a matrix of ecosystem types and methodological \r\napproaches: (1) What are the appropriate scales over which N2 production can and should be \r\nmeasured?; and (2) How can models be integrated with the measurements to improve \r\nmechanistic understanding of the processes and permit estimation of fluxes at larger spatial \r\nscales, longer temporal scales, and across a range of forecasted scenarios?  The results of the \r\nworkshop will be published as one or more synthesis papers in a peer-reviewed journal. \r\n \r\nThe broader impacts of this activity include an effort to direct our scientific \r\nunderstanding of the N cycle toward finding solutions to society.s concerns about \r\neutrophication of the biosphere.  The proposed workshop is being organized as an integral \r\npart of the International Nitrogen Initiative (INI), a joint project of SCOPE and IGBP.  The \r\noverall goal of the INI is to optimize nitrogen's role in sustainable food and energy \r\nproduction, while minimizing negative effects on human health and the environment.  Hence, \r\nthis workshop is part of an effort that has board implications for society by contributing \r\nknowledge to future management the global N cycle to meet objectives of both food security \r\nand environmental quality. \r\n",
