 "awd_abstract_narration": "Alanah Fitch, Loyola University of Chicago, is a Discovery Corps Senior Fellow for the 2004-2005 academic year. Fitch will implement web-based access to various analytical instruments and partner with two Kenyan Universities to conduct various environmental chemistry projects. The project also includes a strong education component examining various access modes (hands-on, real-time virtual and simulation) and will strengthen the research infrastructure in the United States and in Kenya. This Discovery Corps Senior Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\nThe Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service.  Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need.  Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation.  The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.\r\n",
