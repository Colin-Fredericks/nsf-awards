Sharp, Univ. of Louisville\r\n\r\nThis grant is for the acquisition of a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system to enhance collaborative research in biofluid mechanics among faculty in engineering and the medical school.  The PIV system will provide velocity field measurement capabilities not currently available at the University of Louisville. The system can be used for 2D micro PIV measurements in microscopic flow chambers, as well as 3D (macro) PIV measurements for larger flows.  The projects for which the PIV system will be used during the grant period have biomedical applications, a field in which the university has made a major commitment through faculty recruiting and establishment of a Center for Bioengineering.  The following projects will benefit from the acquisition of this equipment:  \"Investigation of the mechanics of flow-induced hemolysis,\" \"Aortic flow distribution during ventricular assistance- dependence on cannulation site, pulsatile or continuous flow, and degree of heart failure,\" and \"Increasing production of ATP-filled vesicles using a microchannel.\"  These projects represent over $4.4 million of currently funded research by six investigators, which are training 22 students and have spawned three patent applications.  Use of the PIV system is expected beyond the grant period not only for extensions to these projects, but also for other investigations including flow-induced enhancement of the response of biosensors, control of artificial hearts for reduced valve impact forces, orientation of nanotube and crystal growth by flow, and flow and transport of toxins in ventilation ducts.  The proposed instrumentation will be shared in an integrated laboratory, creating an environment where cross-disciplinary communication is encouraged and facilitated for the faculty and students, while maximizing efficient use of resources.  The impact of the instrumentation will encompass not only the research projects of the investigators, but also the graduate and undergraduate students actively participating in them, as well as contributing material to at least nine courses in engineering.  Investigators will develop presentations or videos for three age groups for locally active minority and women's groups, including the National Society for Black Engineers, the Society of Women Engineers, the Louisville Black Achievers and the UL INSPIRE program. \r\n",
