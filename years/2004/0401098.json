 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to use combinatorial methods\r\nto solve problems in the field of matrix representations\r\nof groups and algebras, and, conversely, to use representation\r\ntheory to produce new results in enumerative combinatorics.\r\nA main focus of each project is to construct and understand\r\nirreducible representations and characters. The algebraic\r\nstructures under investigation include  symmetric groups and\r\nWeyl groups, the finite general linear group and other finite\r\nChevalley groups, partition algebras, and Hecke algebras.\r\nThese structures often come as pairs acting on vector spaces\r\nand commuting with each other; for example the symmetric group\r\nand the partition algebra commute with each other on tensor\r\nspace and a  Chevalley group and its Hecke algebra commute on\r\na flag variety. This duality allows us to bring known information\r\nfrom one of the algebraic structures to bear on the study of\r\nits partner.   The combinatorial structures used here include\r\nsymmetric functions, partitions, tableaux, integer matrices,\r\nand graphs.  This project will engage undergraduate students\r\nin all aspects of the research. Algebraic combinatorics is an\r\nideal way to introduce young mathematicians and scientists to\r\nresearch, because it uses accessible combinatorial objects,\r\nwhich can be created, analyzed, and manipulated by students\r\nwho do not have of a large amount of advanced training. At the\r\nsame time, these objects enhance the fundamental understanding\r\nof important constructs from algebra, geometry, and topology.\r\n\r\nThe algebraic objects under investigation in this project\r\nrepresent  various kinds of symmetry. These include symmetries\r\nof physical objects --- such as molecules, crystals, knots, or\r\ntensegrities --- and symmetries of complicated systems, such as\r\nphysical models of energy transfer, large sets of ranked data,\r\nor symmetry in the organization of digital image data.\r\nRepresentation theory ``represents\" these symmetries using\r\nmatrices (rectangular arrays of numbers ).  In a given problem,\r\nthere are usually a large number of these matrices and they also\r\nare usually large in dimension (size).  A major goal of\r\ncombinatorial representation theory is to find ways to\r\nsimultaneously decompose these large matrices into their\r\nconstituent building blocks and then to analyze the building\r\nblocks using concrete structures which can be manipulated by\r\nhand and by computer. This is analogous to understanding a\r\ncomplicated molecule by decomposing it into the various atoms\r\nthat make it up and then carefully analyzing those atoms.\r\nSince the early 20th century, representation theory has held\r\na prominent role in theoretical mathematics. Furthermore, it\r\nhas had an enormous impact on physical chemistry, particle\r\nphysics, and knot theory.  In recent years, the areas of\r\napplication of representation theory have grown to include\r\ndata analysis, digital image processing, coding theory, and\r\nengineering.\r\n\r\n",
