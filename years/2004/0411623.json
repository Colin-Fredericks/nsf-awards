The funding will be used to provide partial support of travel and related expenses.  The objective is to encourage student participation in the largest American meeting focused on this subject, to provide opportunities for them to present their work, meet other scientists and engineers from around the world with similar interests, and to see state-of-the-art presentations from other research groups working in this area.  This funding will be used to help disseminate knowledge about state-of-the-art research in membrane science and engineering from around the world to students. This is the premier meeting for scientists and engineers in the American membrane community, and this technology represents one of the fastest-growing separations techniques. It is widely used in the chemical, petrochemical, food processing, food packaging, medical and pharmaceutical industries. The most respected and accomplished membrane scientists and engineers from around the world will participate in this meeting.  In terms of the broader impacts, the proposed meeting sponsorship would allow U.S. graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the most important meeting in the U.S. on membrane science and technology. In addition to 20 technical sessions, five workshops are being planned, and they would provide an additional venue for students and postdoctoral fellows to receive intensive, tutorial training in key fundamental and developing areas of membrane science and technology.\r\n",
