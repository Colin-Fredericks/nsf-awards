 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spin is a fascinating property of matter which has no classical analog and which is largely ignored in mainstream charge-based electronics. As the scalability of conventional devices nears exhaustion, the spin degree of freedom moves to the forefront of research in the quest to find alternative device paradigms. Holes\r\nin semiconductor nanostructures are especially attractive for future implementation of spintronic devices due to their potentially very long spin relaxation times. The goal of this proposal is to understand mechanisms of spin interactions in p-type semiconductor nanostructures, to develop functional spin-based quantum devices, and to develop a versatile educational program closely integrated with this research project.\r\n\r\nSemiconductor nanostructures provide a unique controllable environment where a single spin can be isolated and fundamental aspects of its interactions can be investigated.  Hole nanostructures have a peculiar set of parameters and symmetries that are largely unexplored.  Strong anisotropy of exchange interaction, effective mass and $g$-factor for high index crystallographic axises will allow the applicant to investigate different mechanisms contributing to spin relaxation and to devise efficient methods of spin manipulation. Applications relevant to the emerging fields of spintronics and quantum information processing will be investigated.\r\n\r\nEducational activities are an essential part of the proposed career development plan and are closely integrated with the proposed research program, which include (i) training of graduate and undergraduate students in state-of-the-art experimental techniques via their direct involvement in the proposed research program, (ii) development of a special course ``Physics of Low-dimensional Systems'' and (iii) development of an enrichment program for K-12 students.\r\n",
