 "awd_abstract_narration": "How does animation work?\r\nEye-movement analyses of dynamic geovisualization displays.\r\n\r\nAs real-time three-dimensional landscape fly-throughs and interactive map\r\nanimations of various spatial diffusion processes become ubiquitous with\r\ndissemination through the Internet, the key question that remains is how\r\neffective the potential increase of information density in these highly\r\ninteractive visual forms really is for learning, knowledge construction,\r\nand knowledge dissemination and education.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this proposed project is to empirically evaluate the\r\neffectiveness of interactive and dynamic geographic visualization displays\r\nfor knowledge discovery and knowledge construction.  Based on a research\r\nframework from cognitive science, and utilizing the eye-movement data\r\ncollection approach, a series of controlled animation experiments are\r\nproposed.  These empirical studies adhere to experimental design standards\r\nin cognitive science, but are additionally grounded on a dynamic design\r\nframework borrowed from cartography, computer graphics and cinematography,\r\nto investigate how dynamic visual variables, and various levels of\r\ninteractivity affect people's knowledge construction processes from\r\ndynamic displays as compared to static displays.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this investigation will be a increased understanding of how\r\npeople use dynamic displays to explore dynamic geographic phenomena, and\r\nhow people make inferences from dynamic visualizations for knowledge\r\nconstruction in a geographical context. A dynamic design framework will be\r\ndeveloped informed by the outcomes from the eye-movement studies. This\r\nframework will include design guidelines for academics and practitioners\r\nalike, both of whom employ dynamic graphic displays to educate, to do\r\nresearch, and/or to communicate research results on dynamic spatial\r\nphenomena.\r\n",
