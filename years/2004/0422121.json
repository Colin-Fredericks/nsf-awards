 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is continuing the work of a previous CSEMS award (0094725) to provide scholarship funds for students with financial need and academic excellence.  These students are given the opportunity to gain practical experience and enhanced professional development while learning about the opportunities for participating in research programs with dedicated faculty mentors. These faculty mentors are accomplished researchers in their field and have demonstrated the ability to effectively mentor undergraduate students towards accomplishment of career goals or the pursuit of higher education.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Students are invited to participate in monthly research seminars and a Student Research Forum each semester. Annually, the participants are encouraged to present at an appropriate regional or national professional conference. Recipients may also participate in a career seminar series conducted by career training specialists and industry professionals.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: CSEM Research Scholars are particularly monitored for success rates relative to other campus-wide retention programs and for accomplishment of the CSEM program goals. Through connectivity with other recruiting and retention efforts in these disciplines, underrepresented population groups particularly have the opportunity to experience the excitement and rewards in the fields of engineering and science.",
