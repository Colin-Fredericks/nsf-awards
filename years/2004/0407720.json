 "awd_abstract_narration": "New Urban developments are a higher density, more compact urban form than conventional developments (sprawl).  High density developments like New Urban forms place more people, buildings, and infrastructure at risk than conventional developments on an equivalent land unit exposed to hazards, and thus pose a potentially greater threat.  Despite the rapid expansion of New Urban developments in hazardous areas, no studies have analyzed the effects of New Urban design on hazard mitigation.  The research will contribute to understanding the impacts of New Urban design on integration of mitigation practices into developments.  To make this contribution requires an investigation of whether New Urban developments are at least equally disaster resilient to conventional developments, or whether New Urbanism contributes to increased vulnerability to life and property.  The study will also evaluate the effects of choices that planners and others make in designing mitigation plans and implementation programs regarding their influence on integration of mitigation practices into New Urban developments.\r\nThis study will contribute to knowledge about how Smart Growth programs and New Urban developments can be designed to attain the benefits of New Urbanism without increasing the threat from hazards.  The study will yield guidelines for local governments on how to prepare comprehensive hazard mitigation plans that identify and prioritize mitigation policies focused on New Urban developments; identify site design practices to safely build New Urban developments; and suggest factors that need attention for supporting mitigation involving enforcement, citizen support, and staff capacity.  Because federal and state governments have significant roles in promoting mitigation, the study will also provide guidelines on how to influence local governments and developers to support use of mitigation practices in New Urban developments.\r\n\r\n",
