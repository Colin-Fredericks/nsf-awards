 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)/Collaborative Research project is to develop environmentally benign minimum quantity lubrication grinding processes using nanofluids in place of conventional grinding fluids.  Nanofluids are a new class of heat transfer and anti-wear fluids created by dispensing solid particles smaller than 40 nm in water or oil-based fluid carriers.  The superior thermal and tribological properties of nanofluids make them particularly suitable for minimum quantity lubrication grinding.  In this study, nanofluids using additions of copper, titanium borate, and carbon nanotube nanoparticles will be evaluated.  A new fluid delivery system will be developed using an injector nozzle to accurately deliver a jet of high-pressure nanofluid mist to the grinding zone and a water mist spray to cool the workpiece and grinding wheel.  A vacuum system will be tested to collect the near dry swarf in minimum quantity lubrication grinding.\r\n\r\nGrinding is recognized as an environmentally unfriendly manufacturing process.  The selection and delivery of grinding fluids have traditionally been based upon the need to achieve tangible productivity and cost targets while often neglecting the seemingly less tangible environmental and safety hazards.  If successful, this project can change this paradigm by developing \"green\" grinding processes based on the total cost approach.  It can have a profound impact in industry to bring an awareness of the smart utilization of grinding fluid.  This study can also advance the nanotechnology to environmentally benign manufacturing.  Close collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory and General Motors are expected.",
