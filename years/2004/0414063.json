 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research involves the development of synthetic methods for the production of helicenes.  A variety of 4,5-disubstituted phenanthrene derivatives, helicenes and related nonplanar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons possessing a helical twist will be prepared via the radical cyclization reactions of enyne-allenes.  Thermolysis of enyne-allenes will also be used to synthesize bridged bis(benzofluorene), which, in turn, will serve as precursors for the production of ansa-metallocene complexes of group 4 metals.   The latter have potential use for olefin polymerization.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Kung K. Wang in the Department of Chemistry at West Virginia University.  Dr. Wang will focus his work on developing methodology for the synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons possessing a helical twist (helicenes).  The helicenes are inherently chiral and form a class of materials having interesting optical and electronic properties. The broader impact of the work is in the area of materials science as well as in the field of asymmetric catalysis.  Further, the project presents an excellent vehicle for the training of both undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented populations, and graduate students.\r\n",
