 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will devise and implement techniques for measuring market performance in the electricity  and  postal  delivery  services  industries.    I  will  undertake  four  lines  of  inquiry  measuring\r\nperformance in wholesale electricity markets.  First, I plan to apply the methodologies for measuring market\r\nperformance in the electricity supply industry presented in Borenstein, Bushnell and Wolak (2002) and\r\nWolak (2003b) to provide a comprehensive diagnosis of the causes and solution to the California electricity\r\ncrisis.  I have collected a number of new data sets that will allow me to perform a more comprehensive\r\nanalysis of the causes and remedy for the California electricity crisis.  The second project will adapt these\r\ntwo methodologies for measuring market-wide and firm-level market power (or market inefficiencies) to\r\nwholesale markets that use locational marginal pricing procedures to price electricity.  The third topic is how\r\nto value the net benefits of transmission network upgrades in a wholesale market regime.  Transmission\r\nnetwork expansions have the potential to increase the competitiveness of a wholesale electricity market\r\nbecause they can increase the number of independent suppliers able to compete with each local supplier.  I\r\nam not aware of an internally consistent methodology for valuing transmission upgrades that accounts for\r\nthese market power mitigation benefits.  The power outage in the eastern U.S. on August 14 and 15, 2003,\r\nsuggests that such a methodology is far overdue.  The fourth line of inquiry will study the extent integration\r\nof day-ahead forward markets with the real-time market.  In all U.S. wholesale markets, electricity is traded\r\nin a number of forward markets in advance of delivery.   There are a number of arbitrage relationships that\r\nshould hold between these markets if energy traders are risk-neutral, and a different set of relationships that\r\nshould hold if energy traders are risk-averse.  This research will derive these relationships and examine their\r\nempirical relevance.\r\n\r\nThe US Postal Service (USPS) has experienced considerable financial turmoil  over the past two\r\nyears.  For the first time in the post World War II period, the demand for single piece First-Class mail, the\r\nlargest volume category of mail that the USPS delivers, has experienced a decade of decline. This has caused\r\nthe USPS to implement a number of rate increases to recover lost revenue from these volume decreases.  The\r\nUSPS also has nationwide uniform wage policy for workers in its mail sorting facilities.  This has resulted\r\nin substantial differences in worker productivity across mail sorting facilities.  This using a dataset  obtained\r\nfrom the United States Postal Rate Commission, I will first document the extent of across-facility differences\r\nin worker productivity and quantify the cost to the USPS of its nationwide wage policy.  This analysis should\r\nprovide useful input into the USPS decision-making process for reducing postal operating costs.  I also plan\r\nto extend my previous research on the impact of electronic alternatives to postal delivery services and postal\r\nprice increases on the household-level demand for postal delivery services in a number of directions.",
