 "awd_abstract_narration": "0414475  Fernando  It is proposed to create a cyberinfrastructured Environmental Field Facility (EFF), focusing  on  the  Phoenix metropolis  and  its  regional  environs  as  a  potential  node  of  the  Engineering  Analysis  Network of the NSF's CLEANER  initiative.  This  EFF,  called  MEASURES  (Multi-scale Environmental Analysis in Urban and Regional Ecosystems), will emphasize scientific, engineering and socio-economic issues related to  the  flow of air and water  as well  as  transport and  dispersion  of  flow-borne contaminants over a range of spatio-temporal scales. Intense observations that employ cutting-edge sensor and communications technologies, detailed theoretical analyses and laboratory experiments, high-performance computational simulations, sophisticated predictive modeling and  sensor-model  fusion  are the key approaches to be employed. The data and new findings will be disseminated rapidly in suitable formats: to public officials in support of the policy/decision making and planning, to resource managers for adaptive  management,  to  the  general  public  for  triggering  an  informed  discourse,  and  to  the researchers  for  scientific  discovery  and  knowledge  creation.\r\nIn this planning proposal, a\"proof-of-concept.\"project  is  proposed  as  an  antecedent  to MEASURES.  It involves extensive monitoring of air flow patterns of multiple  space-time  scales, movement of contaminant plumes from point sources and deposition thereof in the regional domain circa urban Phoenix, Arizona. Particular attention will be paid to total Mercury (Hg) associated with regional power  plant  emissions,  considering  that  certain  lakes  in  eastern  Arizona  are  contaminated  by  this neurotoxin; this appears to be a regional counterpart of a serious global problem that is largely attributed to aerial transport/deposition and runoff. \r\n",
