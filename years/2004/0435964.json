 "awd_abstract_narration": "The innermost computational kernel of many large-scale scientific applications and\r\nindustrial numerical simulations is often a large sparse matrix problem, which typically\r\nconsumes a significant portion of the overall computational time required by the simulation.\r\nMany of the matrix problems are in the form of systems of linear equations, although other\r\ntypes of problems, such as eigenvalue calculations, can occur too. A tremendous impact\r\nwill be made if the performance of these sparse matrix solvers can be improved.\r\nA traditional approach to solving large sparse matrix equations is to use direct\r\nmethods. This approach is often preferred in industry because direct solvers are\r\nrobust and effective for moderate size problems. However, the unprecedented pace\r\nof the advance in technology has led to a dramatic growth in the size of the matrices\r\nto be handled. For example, the storage requirement for three-dimensional simulations makes\r\ndirect methods prohibitively expensive. Iterative techniques are the only viable alternative.\r\nUnfortunately, iterative methods lack the robustness of direct methods. They often fail\r\nwhen the matrix is very ill-conditioned. This is the reason for the tremendous current\r\ninterest in preconditioning techniques for large sparse matrix problems: preconditioners\r\ndramatically improve the robusteness and performance of iterative algorithms. \r\n\r\nIn spite of much progress on preconditioning techniques over the last few years,\r\niterative solvers are still not always completely reliable and efficient. The proposed\r\nconference, the fourth in a series of biannual meetings on preconditioning, intends to\r\naddress the complex issues related to the solution of general sparse matrix problems\r\nin large-scale real applications and in industrial settings. The issues related to \r\nsparse matrix software that are of interest to application scientists and industrial\r\nusers are often fairly different from those on which the academic community is focused.\r\nFor example, for an application scientist or an industrial user, improving robustness\r\nmay be far more important than finding a method that would gain speed. Memory usage is\r\nalso an important consideration, but is seldom accounted for in academic research on\r\nsparse matrix solvers. As a last example, linear systems solved in applications are\r\nalmost always part of some nonlinear iteration (e.g., Newton) or optimization loop.\r\nIt is important to consider the coupling between the linear and nonlinear parts, instead\r\nof focusing on the linear systems alone. The speakers of this conference will discuss\r\nsome of the latest developments in the field of preconditioning techniques for sparse\r\nmatrix problems. The conference will allow participants from academia, industry and\r\ngovernment labs to exchange findings in this area and to explore possible new directions\r\nin light of emerging paradigms, such as parallel processing and object-oriented programming.\r\n\r\n",
