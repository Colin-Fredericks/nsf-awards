 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to bring various classes of groups\r\ncommonly studied by geometric group theorists (such as Artin groups,\r\none-relator groups, small cancellation groups, word-hyperbolic groups,\r\nfundmental groups of ample twisted face pairing 3-manifolds, etc.)\r\nwithin range of one of the standard general theories (such as\r\npiecewise Euclidean spaces of nonpositive curvature, conformal\r\nnonpositive curvature, or Garside structures) by constructing\r\nappropriate complexes on which they act.  For example, there are\r\nemerging strategies for constructing high-dimensional nonpositively\r\ncurved cube complexes for metric small cancellation groups as well as\r\nfor fundamental groups of ample twisted face pairing 3-manifolds, for\r\nconstructing 2-dimensional conformally CAT(0) complexes for\r\none-relator groups, and for constructing Garside-like structures for\r\narbitrary Artin groups.  Geometric and enumerative combinatorics play\r\na prominent role in the constructions themselves as well as in the\r\nestablishment of their major properties.  In each case, the complexes\r\nconstructed and the approaches themselves are new and innovative and\r\ntheir key properties are in the process of being established.  Early\r\nindications are that these complexes carry geometric and combinatorial\r\nstructures which would resolve such longstanding conjectures as the\r\ncoherence of one-relator groups, and the solution of the word problem\r\nfor Artin groups.\r\n\r\nThis project lies at the interface between geometric/combinatorial\r\ngroup theory and geometric/enumerative combinatorics.  The former\r\nstudies algebraic structures associated with geometric objects (such\r\nas their group of symmetries) while the latter can be roughly defined\r\nas the study of things which can be described using only a finite\r\namount of data.  This is precisely the type of mathematics that\r\ncomputers can do.  Computational mathematics might seem far removed\r\nfrom geometric considerations, but there is a growing collection of\r\ncombinatorial phenomena which can best be viewed as finite analogues\r\nof facts about the curvature of smooth spaces.  The primary goal of\r\nthis project is to use these computationally discovered combinatorial\r\nphenomena to construct complexes which carry a geometric/topological\r\nstructure which then explain the observed algebraic behavior of the\r\noriginal groups.\r\n\r\n",
