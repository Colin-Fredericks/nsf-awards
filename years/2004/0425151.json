 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation aims to explore the changing contours of American evangelicalism, examining its development as a contemporary social movement and paying particular attention to the role of societal leaders in the refashioning of this religious movement.  Evangelicalism is a central part of the American religious landscape, and it has changed over the last thirty years.  While some studies have explored the evangelical movement at the grassroots level, little scholarly attention has been directed to the role of elites within American evangelicalism.  This dissertation hypothesizes that a cohort of elites-who will be called \"leading evangelicals\"-represent the \"hidden hand\" of evangelicalism and have exerted significant, often understated influence in changing the movement's direction, scope, and strategies since 1976. This project seeks to understand how a cohort of leading evangelicals have transformed the movement from one confined to the lower socio-economic strata of American life to a movement at home in the White House and among other positions of societal influence.  Through semi-structured interviews with leading evangelical informants, content analysis of evangelical organizations' documents, and participant-observation at several evangelical gatherings, this project will bring to bear multiple methods of inquiry to examine this important, changing aspect of American society.  The proposed research will address five primary issues:  1) identification of leading evangelicals and an analysis of their religious lives; 2) relative cohesion and polarization of leading evangelical networks; 3) legitimating the movement to a wider public audience; 4) financing the movement and examining the tensions among issues of power, wealth, and philanthropy; and 5) social movement leadership.  The broader impacts of this research are as follows:  This research will be of useful to researchers interested in understanding contemporary U.S. evangelicalism, elites' religious lives, ways in which contemporary religious movements interact with the wider social world, particularly at the highest levels of power and influence, the relationships between cultural icons and the general public within the matrix of a shared identity, and the role of elites and their networks in refashioning institutional boundaries and cultural repertoires.",
