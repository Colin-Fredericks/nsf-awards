 "awd_abstract_narration": "Game  consoles,  with  price  points  below  $300,  performance  rivaling  or  exceeding  that  of  PCs,  and  graphics  capabilities  recently  found  only  on  high-end  visualization  supercomputers,  are  the  vanguard  of  yet  another computing  generation  .  computing  on  toys. Moreover,  market  forces  and  fierce  vendor  competition  (e.g.,  among  Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony) continue to fuel technical innovation and performance improvements on these game  platforms, creating research and development incentives and deployment opportunities in new domains. \r\n \r\nThis  proposal  outlines  a  research  plan  to  assess  the  utility  and  performance  of  game  systems  for  both  scientific  computing and high-resolution visualization.  This assessment of game systems will be based on development of a  suite of adaptive performance analysis tools that support both offline and online performance optimization and their  application  to  a  suite  of  scientific  and  visualization  codes.    This  effort  leverages  proposed  Red  Hat  and  NCSA  software  enhancements  to  PlayStation2  Linux  software.    In  addition  we  currently  are  negotiating  with  Sony  to  acquire and deploy a large PlayStation2 cluster at NCSA for experimental assessment and scientific visualization.   \r\n \r\nOur  computing  on  toys  software  research  plan  focuses  on  three  areas:  (a)  offline,  multilevel  performance instrumentation of applications and system software, (b) online, adaptive selection of multi-version code execution,  and (c) experimental assessment using large-scale scientific applications and visualization software. New hardware performance  measurements, instrumented scientific and graphics libraries, and performance derivatives, all  integrated with  our  SvPablo  performance  analysis  infrastructure, will  provide  the  requisite  data  to move  iterative performance tuning from an ad hoc style to one based on intelligent feedback and suggestions.  The offline version  of this SvPablo extension will accept performance metrics from hardware, software, and library instrumentation and  generates  suggestions  for  tuning  locations  and  options  using  a  fuzzy  logic  rule  base  that  embodies  performance \r\ntuning suggestions for the Sony PlayStation2.   \r\n \r\n\r\n",
