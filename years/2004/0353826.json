 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collaborations between the NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) on Nanoscopic Materials Design at the University of Virginia and the SSF-funded Nanometer Consortium at the University of Lund, Sweden combines the leading expertise and facilities at two internationally recognized centers for the development of new materials, methods and understanding for the development of low dimensional semiconductor heterostuctures and nanostructured electronic systems.  Specific research include a) nanoscale localization of electrons / holes in three dimensions using ordered semiconductor superlattice.whisker.arrays, b) topology- and strain-induced periodic decomposition in semiconductor alloys, and c) focuse ion beam delivery of optically/magnetically active manganese atoms and clusters into III-V heterostructures with nanoscale precision.  A fourth project is concerned with exploratory programs in the nanoscale integration of semiconductor and biological systems with an initial emphasis on the fabrication and characterization  of interdigitated electrode arrays for use as redox-recycling biosensors.  This project will be primarily funded by the Lund group with some experimental support from UVA.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration provides a new educational dimension for participating undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs in the two centers by providing a greatly enhanced international perspective through a set of innovative joint research and educational activities.  Formation of project teams, incorporating graduate students and postdocs from both institutions, ensures extensive interdisciplinary and international perspective, and the participants will spend extended periods pursuing their research and education programs at the partner institution.   \r\n\r\n",
