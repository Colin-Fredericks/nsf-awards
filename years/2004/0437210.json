 "awd_abstract_narration": "A large segment of the economic literature is concerned with the study\r\nof allocations that arise when markets are not well functioning. The\r\ndefining characteristics of this literature are its focus on\r\ninformational and spatial frictions and the desire to make them explicit\r\nby assuming that economic interactions occur in small coalitions. The\r\ntraditional modeling tool is that of a matching framework. A limitation\r\nof this literature is that the treatment of matching--as a\r\ntechnology--is mostly  descriptive and hazily formalized. These\r\nshortcomings contribute to blur the precise connection between the\r\nconstraints imposed by the matching technology, the environmental\r\nfrictions, and the possible allocations. The proposed research will\r\ndevelop a fully integrated mathematical approach to matching mechanisms\r\nby formalizing and studying the  following: (i) the mechanics of\r\nmatching in bi- and multi-lateral settings (deterministic and\r\nstochastic); (ii) the links between matching and trade frictions,\r\nproviding exact mappings between technologies and\r\ninformational constraints; (iii) the allocative implications of\r\ndifferent matching mechanisms in general monetary and non-monetary\r\neconomies. A clear understanding of these connections will advance the\r\nformulation of sophisticated economic models based on markets with\r\nimpaired functioning \r\nand promises to clarify the implications of policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA major concern of economics is how scarce resources are allocated when\r\nmarkets are not well functioning. Market frictions often involve\r\nscarcity of information or geographical separation or inadequate\r\ninstitutions. In general, the economic literature makes these frictions\r\nexplicit by modeling trade as occurring in small groups--often pairwise\r\nmatches. The resulting matching frameworks are used to answer basic\r\nquestions in a variety of settings;\r\nfrom economic governance to unemployment and from business cycles to\r\nmonetary policy. A shortcoming of these frameworks is that the modeling\r\nof matching technologies is mostly descriptive and superficially\r\nformalized. This blurs the exact link between the obstacles faced by\r\nparticipants in the market place and the trades they can execute. The\r\nproposed research will develop a theoretical foundation for this class\r\nof models. It will formalize the\r\nmechanics of how different trading frameworks can facilitate (or\r\nobstacle) the exchange of information and other economic resources. It\r\nwill precisely chart the link between the frictions impinging on the\r\ntrading process and the possible allocations. This will advance our\r\nunderstanding of how to construct sophisticated economic models whose\r\ncentral trait is markets with impaired functioning. The results will\r\nhave applications to other disciplines, such as biology (spread of\r\ndiseases), sociology (formation of social groups), and engineering\r\n(network communication).\r\n",
