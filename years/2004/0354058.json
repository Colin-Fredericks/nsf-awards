 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU site in Spectroscopy at Coe College, sponsored jointly by the Physics and Chemistry departments, continues a tradition of strong interaction with undergraduate students pursuing high-level, publishable research.  REU students carry out research in glass science, optics, environmental chemistry, organic synthesis, acoustics, and atmospheric chemistry, all under the common focus of spectroscopy. They are exposed to and trained in a variety of techniques, including FTIR, Raman, NMR, time of flight mass spectrometry, absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies, x-ray fluorescence, thermal calorimetry. Projects are designed to be suitable for undergraduates, but are also challenging and leading to results of interest to external researchers.  Additional educational activities provide participating students with a well-rounded exposure to different spectroscopic techniques. The site is very friendly and student centered, with students working directly with professors and alongside more senior research students.  The site is especially interested in students from rural backgrounds who attend small colleges offering little or no opportunities for research.\r\n\r\nThis site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n",
