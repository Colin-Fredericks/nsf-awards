 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will spatial ability as an essential skill in Science, Technology, Engineering Education.  A strong correlation exists between spatial ability and achievement in the undergraduate study of engineering, chemistry, biology, and physics. In particular, the ability to correctly visualize three dimensional objects when they are represented in two dimensions by Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software or in a part drawing, is a vital spatial skill for current mechanical engineering, civil technology, and civil engineering students. Research has shown that the spatial ability of STEM students will improve through training, for example during a semester long course that uses 3D computer modeling software and paper and pencil activities and also that students preferred working simultaneously with real physical objects when\r\ndeveloping these skills. Furthermore, spatial ability training over the course of a semester has lead to improved retention in engineering and technical fields.  However, optimal training methods are unknown. For instance, shorter training, taking significantly less time than an entire semester, may produce similar results, and the integration of an actual physical model with commonly used CAD software programs may produce further advances in spatial ability. Additionally, there is a critical need to identify students who are at-risk due to poorly developed spatial skills and who should thus be targeted for enhanced training.\r\n     In the proposed research, a computer integrated Physical Model Rotator (PMR) device will be designed and implemented for use in spatial ability assessment and training. The PMR device will rotate a real object in synchronous motion with a virtual model of the same object on the computer screen. This simple device will assist the user in bridging the perceptual gap between the 3D object and its 2D representation on the\r\ncomputer screen. Device construction will be followed by a study to assess its effectiveness and to develop optimal training methodology. The study will include bachelor degree mechanical engineering and civil engineering students from the University of New Hampshire and associate degree civil technology students from the Thompson School of Applied Science. Standard spatial ability tests and selfconcept and self-efficacy questionnaires will be used for evaluation before and after PMR training. The spatial ability improvements attained may particularly affect the retention of women, who are underrepresented in engineering fields. Web-based assessment tools will be developed which will be used to identify at-risk students who will then be targeted for enhanced training to improve their spatial ability. This project may affect both the quality, through improved achievement, and quantity, through increased retention, of engineering students by improving spatial ability skills.\r\n\r\n",
