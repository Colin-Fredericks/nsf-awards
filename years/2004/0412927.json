 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the development of methodology for the transformation of acyclic starting materials into eight member rings.  The scope and mechanism of the rhodium catalyzed [4+2+2] cycloisomerization reaction of dienynes will be examined and the findings extended to include other substrates. Further, the nature of the rhodium catalyst system will be explored.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Scott R. Gilbertson of the Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.   Dr. Gilbertson will focus his work on developing catalytic methodology for the synthesis of eight member rings, a class of compounds difficult to prepare by standard synthetic methods.  In terms of broader impacts, the project has potential for developing green chemistry and for the training of graduate students. \r\n",
