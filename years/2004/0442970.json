 "awd_abstract_narration": "On June 15-18, 2005, the University of Massachusetts will host the Sixth Graduate Students Research Conference sponsored by the American Chemical Society Polymer Division.  The principal goal of this conference is to enhance interaction for graduate students working in chemical sciences with specific interest in polymers.  The Polymer Science and Engineering Department will organize this conference along with several senior members of the American polymer community.  Significantly, this is the only conference with principal emphasis devoted to graduate students.  IT is important they interact with each other as emerging professionals.  Research accomplishments will be presented both orally and at poster sessions.  Discussions in various topics of emerging fields of study will be held by several leading researchers in the polymer community.  In addition, the students will have the opportunity to meet leaders of the polymer industry on an informal basis.  It is anticipated that 150 students will attend.  The University of Massachusetts seeks funding in support of this conference from the National Science Foundation.",
