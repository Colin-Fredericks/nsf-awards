 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses a high-impact, high-interest program visualization environment, Alice, to introduce a strong core of fundamental programming concepts (objects, classes, methods, functions, decisions, variables, parameters, loops) and problem-solving and design techniques to beginning programmers. It addresses the high attrition rate of computer science majors during their first year of study as well as the need for innovative materials and strategies for teaching programming in computer literacy and service courses. Unfortunately, students who are not computer science majors often have poor attitudes toward programming courses and the enrollment of women in computer science has been declining. The results of a previous NSF proof-of-concept project includes evidence that this approach can significantly improve achievement and retention of high-risk CS-majors during their first year. There is also anecdotal evidence that this approach captures student interest and motivates positive attitudes for women and minorities.\r\n\r\nPrevious work has yielded a prototype of instructional materials and a textbook that work synergistically with the Alice high-interest software environment. The prototype materials have been pilot tested and peer reviewed. Other faculty members have successfully used these materials, but no formal testing has been done beyond the pilot project. Thus, the project includes using and formally testing the revised materials at regional test sites during the first and second years of the project. The regional test sites are at different types of institutions, serving students with diverse backgrounds and career goals.",
