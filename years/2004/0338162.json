 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Track 2, GK-12 project builds upon a very successful partnership between the College of Engineering at N.C. State University and the science curriculum branch of Wake County, N.C. Public Schools, who together have launched a major science reform effort in the county.  \r\n\r\nThe Intellectual Merit of the proposal includes: tracking Fellow progress to degree and subsequent career path and having engineering and math Fellows work together with partner teachers to develop and implement inquiry-based math activities that are designed to enhance math instruction for all students. \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impact of the project is high.  The program serves as a model for schools across the state of North Carolina with the techniques and activities developed becoming part of the program being used as a model by other states.  The Fellow/teacher teams develop lesson plans and teaching techniques that are distributed: via the web, through distance education, through presentations at education, and engineering and evaluation professional conferences and related publications. \r\n\r\nOutcomes from Prior Project:  This project has resulted in the preparation of a county-wide science reform effort to change to inquiry-based science teaching in every school in the county of over 100,000 students.  The GK-12 Fellows model has been adopted by the Introduction to Engineering class as a semester-long design project option, and the teaching of this class has been changed to include more inquiry-based presentation on the part of the university instructors as well. A handbook was developed for interpreting science to hearing impaired students, as well as a suggested standardized list of STEM related signs to be used county-wide.  All participating Fellows have gone on to pursue opportunities for outreach during their professional careers.   \r\n\r\nThis project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Engineering.\r\n\r\n \r\nTitle: Track 2, GK-12 Engineers and Teachers for Mathematics Success\r\nInstitution: North Carolina State University\r\nPI/Co-PI: Laura J. Bottomley (Engineering), Karen Hollebrands (Education), and Elizabeth Parry (Science Surround)\r\nPartner School District: Wake County Public Schools\r\nNumber of Fellows per Year: 5 graduate students, 15 undergraduate students\r\nTarget Audience: Grades 3-8\r\nSetting: Urban and rural\r\nNSF Supported Disciplines: Engineering, mathematics, science\r\n",
