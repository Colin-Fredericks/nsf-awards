The Conference will be held in Albuquerque New Mexico on July\r\n26-28 2004. In particular travel expenses, accommodations and conference registration\r\nfees for ten students will be covered by this activity.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits\r\n\r\nProbabilistic mechanics is increasingly becoming more significant in the analysis\r\nof complex systems exhibiting multiscale and multiphysics behavior. The\r\nPMC04 Conference provides a unique forum for the nurturing and development\r\nof these ideas in the context of engineering mechanics. Sessions are being\r\norganized both in traditional areas of engineering such as wind, earthquake\r\nand offshore engineering as well as in more cutting edge areas such as nanomechanics,\r\noptimization under uncertainty, and risk management of complex\r\nsystems. It is expected that about 250 participants will take present their work\r\nat this meeting.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nSpecial attention will be given to the inclusion of minorities and women in the\r\ngroup of participants supported by this grant. The broader impact of the proposed\r\nactivity consists of providing young researchers with the opportunity to\r\nparticipate in the premier international conference on probabilistic methods.\r\nThis will expose these researchers to the diversity of current thinking and approaches\r\nfor this increasingly important branch of science and engineering.\r\n\r\n",
