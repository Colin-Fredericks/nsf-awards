 "awd_abstract_narration": "A stochastic information fusion methodology is developed to assimilate electrical resistivity tomography, high-frequency ground penetrating radar, mid-range-frequency radar, pneumatic/gas tracer tomography, and hydraulic/tracer tomography to image fractures, characterize hydrogeophysical properties, and monitor natural processes in the vadose zone.  The information technology research will develop: (1) mechanisms and algorithms for fusion of large data volumes; (2) parallel adaptive computational engines supporting parallel adaptive algorithms and multi-physics/multi-model computations; (3) adaptive runtime mechanisms for proactive and reactive runtime adaptation and  optimization of geophysical and hydrological models of the subsurface; and (4) technologies and infrastructure for remote (pervasive) and collaborative access  to computational capabilities for monitoring subsurface processes through interactive visualization tools.\r\n\r\nThe combination of the stochastic fusion approach and information technology can lead to a new level of capability for both hydrologists and geophysicists enabling them to \"see\" into the earth at greater depths and resolutions than is possible today.  Furthermore, the new computing strategies will make high resolution and large-scale hydrological and geophysical modeling feasible for the private sector, scientists, and engineers who are unable to access supercomputers, i.e., it is an effective paradigm for technology transfer. \r\n",
