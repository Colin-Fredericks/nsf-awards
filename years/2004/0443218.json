 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Inorganic, Bioinorganic, and Organometallic Program of the Chemistry Division supports the 36th International Conference on Coordination Chemistry (ICCC) in Merida, Mexico, July 18-23, 2004. Specifically, assistance with travel costs will be provided to participants in a small workshop to discuss the state of inorganic chemistry and how communications and collaborations can be improved between biannual ICCC meetings. Broad representation from the participating countries will be sought.\r\n\r\nThe ICCC is a premier international meeting in the area of inorganic chemistry. The 36th ICCC meeting was originally scheduled to be held in Israel, but the international situation forced rescheduling. A joint Mexican/United States organizing committee was able to reschedule the meeting to Merida, Mexico, on short notice. This award will assist the inorganic chemistry community to assess how international interactions can be maintained and strengthened in times when the ICCC is not held.\r\n",
