 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this U.S.-Czech research project between Martin Moskovits of the University of California-Santa Barbara and Czech partner, Blanka Vlckova of Charles University, in Prague, is to engineer metal nanostructures (primarily Ag and Au) which generate strong optical fields when externally excited. This will be accomplished by bringing together senior and junior U.S. and Czech chemists with complementary expertise: 1) to refine the theoretical framework for understanding molecular-surface dynamics and processes and 2) to engineer systems of Surface-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) that allow single detection or at least detection at the level of very few molecules.  Results are expected to lead to molecular assembly approaches that generate SERS-active nanostructures.\r\n\r\nOverall, a more efficient approach for creating optical field-enhancing nanostructures would enhance our ability to produce molecules to form bridging links between either bare or chemically functionalized Ag and Au metallic nanostructures that can serve as building blocks.  The intended building blocks include metal nanoparticles, metal nanowires and flat metal surfaces.  If successful, this research could lead to interdisciplinary advances in single-molecule sensitivity, with potential applications in synthesis of materials, advanced nanofabrication, condensed matter physics, electrical engineering, chemical analysis and surface science.\r\n\r\nThis nano science and technology project fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.   Broader impacts include the introduction of U.S. students to the international nanoscience community through work at a Czech institution and direct involvement in the project's single molecule SERS measurements and nanofabrication systems.",
