 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) The goal of this project is to incorporate Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) into all levels of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum at Nashville State Community College in order to enhance students' learning experiences and broaden the appeal of our chemistry program.  The project is responding to the expectations of the American Chemical Society and recent recommendations by the National Research Council to include the latest developments in science and technology in introductory chemistry curricula.  Laboratory experiments from the chemical education literature that utilize FTIR are being adapted for use in introductory chemistry, general chemistry, organic chemistry, and in biology and biotechnology courses.  In addition, the FTIR is being utilized to provide hands-on activities for students from a high school located on campus.  The presence of the FTIR is enhancing our ability to provide students with the technical skills and motivation to pursue professional careers in science.  The impact of this curricular upgrade on student learning and interest in the subject is being evaluated and the results will be disseminated to the larger community.",
