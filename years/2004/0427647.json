 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nProgress has been made in producing single photon states. But so far those sources have\r\nsmall efficiency and are wavelength dependent and are limited for practical applications.\r\nRecently a new scheme was proposed and demonstrated for producing photon source\r\nwith sub-Poissonian photon statistics. The scheme relies on a two-photon quantum\r\ninterference phenomenon to reduce and eventually cancel the two-photon events from a\r\ncoherent state. In this program, we propose to implement the scheme in an optical\r\ncommunication environment. More specifically, we will start with a fiber pulsed laser as\r\nthe primary source and use a combination of wave guide nonlinear optical materials to\r\nproduce a two-photon state for canceling the two-photon events in a coherent state. The\r\ntechnical challenge will primarily be the temporal mode match for a complete destructive\r\ntwo-photon interference. Such a source has the advantages of high secure data rate,\r\nwell-defined direction and wavelength independence for practical application in\r\nquantum cryptography. This source can also be used to form a three-photon interferometer for\r\nnonlocality test of quantum mechanics.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nQuantum cryptography, when implemented in the correct condition, will provide\r\nunbreakable codes for secure communication. The potential benefit of this technology is\r\ntremendous, given the current status of security issue in information technology. The\r\nproposed program will significantly improve the applicability of quantum cryptography.\r\nParticipation of graduate students and undergraduate students in the research is an\r\nintegral part of the proposed program, which will train and prepare next generation\r\nquantum physicists for the information age in the new century. Results of the research\r\nwill be published in international journals to enhance scientific and technological\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\n",
