Invited talks from outstanding researchers will set the theme for the workshop, followed by reports of current research activities and directions. The workshop will involve students as well as researchers well-established in these fields. To encourage reporting of preliminary results without prejeducing their publication in established journals, no published proceedings are planned, but accepted position papers will be available on the Internet.   The workshop is not expected to lead to specific new programs at NSF but rather to generate research collaborations that will be better able to respond to existing NSF programs and more generally to critical national needs in these areas\r\n",
