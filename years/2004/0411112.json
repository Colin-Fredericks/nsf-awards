 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social Science - Other (89)\r\n\r\nAlthough research shows that law officers benefit from higher education, the educational barriers they face are persistent, and, in comparison to other professionals, they are much less likely to seek postsecondary education. To reduce these barriers and increase the numbers of law officers pursuing higher education, this work is undertaking a 12-month process to plan the Vollmer project.  Its main tasks are to: 1) identify curriculum, programs, and learning modules demonstrating alternative pedagogies that could reduce barriers; 2) design a comprehensive learning environment that will meet the needs of undergraduates who also are criminal justice professionals; 3) develop an action plan to implement the curriculum reform; and 4) design a database to collect information regarding the learners' experience in the Vollmer project.  The project has the potential to increase the number of police officers continuing their careers with stronger skills.  It is also providing a replicable model for other community colleges and law enforcement agencies as they work together to build a workforce that will meet heightened security challenges across the country. \r\n",
