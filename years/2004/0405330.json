 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nPI: Lijian Yang\r\nPROPOSAL : 0405330\r\n\r\nThis research develops multi-step ahead forecasting methods for\r\nnonlinear time series using a Monte-Carlo procedure. The focus is on\r\ntaking advantage of three types of simplifying structures in nonparametric\r\nauotoregression time series models: small number of significant lags,\r\nadditive model, and additive coefficient model. For time series data\r\ngenerated according to one of these structures, plug-in type predictors\r\nare developed by estimating the data generating process (DGP) and\r\nthen using the estimated DGP to generate realizations. By employing local\r\npolynomial and polynomial spline techniques for the regression structure\r\nand kernel density estimation for the noise distribution, the empirical\r\ndistribution of these generated realizations approximates the theoretical\r\ndistribution of the time series at rates much faster than that of general\r\nmultivariate function smoothing. Hence, the proposed forecasts are much\r\nmore accurate than those made with many existing methods. Multi-step ahead\r\nforecasting of time series generated by either multiple index or partially\r\nlinear autoregression are also studied, for which the forecasting\r\naccuracy is improved significantly as well. Besides being\r\ntheoretically justified, the proposed forecasting methods are expected to\r\nbe computationally expedient and should be easily accessible to\r\npractitioners working with time series data.\r\n\r\nTime series data appear in many scientific disciplines in the form of\r\nsequences of numbers observed over fixed time period. Economic time series\r\ninclude leading indicators such as inflation index, oil price, real GNP,\r\nunemployment rate, etc., observed monthly or quarterly. Climatology\r\nstudies the trend and variation over time of humidity, precipitation,\r\ntemperature, etc, while geographers collect daily measurements of such\r\nvariables as leaf area index, soil adjusted vegetation index, soil\r\nmoisture index and investigate relationships that exist among them and\r\nwith other indices. Of central importance in the analysis of time series\r\nis the understanding of the hidden mechanism that generate the data\r\nsequentially, and the use of such knowledge to predict what the next one\r\nor few numbers will be. These are one- and multi-step ahead forecasting.\r\nThe statistical tools developed through this research significantly\r\nenhance the capability to forecast macro-economic time series data several\r\nquarters, even years, ahead. Advanced forecasts of this kind can greatly\r\nhelp the making of macro-economic decisions. These forecasting methods\r\nhave strong impact in multiple disciplines beyond macroeconomics, for\r\ninstance, in the study of interaction between climate change and the\r\nvarious geographic indices.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
