 "awd_abstract_narration": "The second meeting of the International Rosaceae Genome Mapping Consortium will be held at Clemson University in South Carolina in May 2004. In cooperation with many groups worldwide, US researchers have launched a major research effort to genetically and physically map the peach genome and to place on these maps as many ESTs as possible. These genomic resources serve as the substrate for identification and characterization of genes important to all Rosaceae breeding programs. With the appropriate coordination of research laboratories, data can be annotated and archived in a single format, facilitating creation of a central worldwide repository. To expedite the construction of a central database, it is essential to discuss and implement a data system that all can use. This workshop will bring together young and experienced researchers in this field and foster greater cooperation in this worldwide effort to develop peach as the model for fruit tree genomics.\r\n\r\nThe objectives are:\r\n1. To update the community on the worldwide status of Rosaceae genomics efforts including, mapping of important traits in the different species, physical map and EST development, status of the Prunus genetic map database, and introduction of the Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR).\r\n2. To discuss the cooperative integration of Rosaceae genomics data into the growing database housed at Clemson University.\r\n3. To coordinate future projects utilizing the data for gene discovery and characterization of peach as the model genome for the family.\r\n\r\nThe conference will consist of three plenary presentations and oral presentations from consortium groups to summarize the state of Rosaceae genomics research, education and outreach. The results will be disseminated via an abstract booklet created in advance for the meeting, which will also be available online from the GDR website.\r\n",
