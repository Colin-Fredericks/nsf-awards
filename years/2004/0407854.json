 "awd_abstract_narration": "0224006  Anex  This MUSES project is aimed at developing the people, skills and tools needed for understanding the system-wide sustainability of biobased products.  The transition to a sustainable raw material base will be one of the most important challenges facing society in the 21st Century.  As part of this endeavor, substantial increases in the use of biomass-derived feedstock in the chemical industry are expected over the next 50 years.\r\nA key task of the project is organizing and hosting a two-day international workshop on assessing the sustainability of biobased products.  The team will develop background materials for workshop participants that will include a survey of the technologies that underlie biobased material production and a survey of the literature on biobased material assessment techniques and sustainability indicators.  Drawing on the expertise of the interdisciplinary research team, the literature, and the output of the consensus workshop, the team will develop a framework for evaluating the complex environmental-social-industrial system comprising biobased material production, use, and end-of-life disposition.\r\nThe team will be working throughout the project with the Authentic Teaching Alliance (ATA) to prepare a teaching module appropriate for secondary math and science classes.  A team of two ATA Fellows and one secondary math or science teacher will partner with our team to develop and evaluate a learning module.  This module will serve as a template for planned future module development.  A case study applying sustainability indicators to a biobased material life cycle will also be developed and distributed as an education resource.\r\n",
