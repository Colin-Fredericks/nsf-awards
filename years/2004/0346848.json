 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award to Massachusetts Institute of Technology is to study interfacial networks in polycrystalline materials and to tailor the network interfaces treating the network as a complex system, and to understand interfacial network topology, and, specifically, the long-range connectivity of interfaces with 'desirable' and 'detrimental' properties.  Computational modeling and experimental approaches will be utilized to design metallic microstructures with the ultimate aim of quantifying microstructures and correlating their properties.  In the broader impact of this award, research and teaching will be integrated with the involvement of students at all levels of education, including graduate, undergraduate, and secondary.  Upgrading undergraduate level teaching of materials and organizing interactive programs with local high school students through scientific demonstrations are stated goals of this award.\r\n\r\nComputational modeling and experimental approaches will be utilized to design metallic microstructures to understand interfacial network topology, and, specifically, the long-range connectivity of interfaces with 'desirable' and 'detrimental' properties.  The ultimate goal of these studies would be quantifying microstructures and correlating their properties.  Potential applications of these studies include those materials, which would benefit through grain boundary engineering processing such as high temperature nickel-based super alloys, and low temperature semiconductors and devices including materials used in micro-electromechanical systems.  In the broader impact of this award, research and teaching will be integrated with the involvement of graduate, undergraduate and secondary school students. Interactive programs including scientific demonstrations will be organized for local high school students to educate them about the privileges, benefits and challenges involved in a science career.",
