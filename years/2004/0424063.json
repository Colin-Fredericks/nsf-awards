 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) The LivePhoto Physics project is developing a collection of digital video \r\nanalysis materials for introductory physics courses, using research-based development\r\nmethods that were refined through projects such as Tools for Scientific Thinking\r\nand Workshop Physics. These materials include videos, lecture demonstration\r\nsequences, homework assignments, instructor notes, and software. In digital video\r\nanalysis, students use computers as laboratory instruments to make measurements\r\non video images of real events. These techniques are being used increasingly in\r\nphysics courses, and there is evidence that they are effective in teaching physics\r\nconcepts. In spite of the wealth of mass-media and educational videos available that\r\ncan be used in laboratories or student projects, very few existing videos are ideal for\r\nanalysis by students. The LivePhoto Physics project is\r\nmeeting this need by producing a collection of digital videos that span many of the\r\ntopics covered in a one-year physics course, including videos made with high-\r\nspeed/slow-motion equipment that is not available at most teaching facilities. An\r\ninnovative aspect of the project is that the topic selection is being guided by the\r\nresults of physics education research. Written curricular materials using the videos\r\nin Interactive Lecture Demonstrations, distance-learning exercises and extended\r\nhomework problem sets are being produced and classroom tested in a three-year\r\nresearch-based development cycle. Field testing is taking place at two-year colleges\r\nand four-year colleges/universities with diverse student audiences. Computer\r\nsoftware that extends the display and visualization capabilities of digital video\r\nanalysis is being developed during the project. The final set of videos, curricular\r\nmaterials and software will be published in the form of a CD. The LivePhoto\r\nPhysics project is addressing the need for faculty development and the integration of\r\ntechnology in education by sponsoring six workshops on the use of digital video\r\nanalysis in physics teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
