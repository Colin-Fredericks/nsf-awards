 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is explore the nanostructural and electrical properties of the near 2 nanometer (~2 nm)-thick interface layer that is formed between the 5 nm-thick metal oxide film and the silicon substrate when a nano-size device is prepared. The approach is to experimentally investigate 1) the influence of the dopant on the interface properties, 2) the above interface with the existence of a pre-deposited 5A TaNx interface layer, and 3) the relationship between the interface material properties with the nano device's electrical behavior. \r\n\r\nThe success of this research is critical to the improvement of people's daily lives through the advancement of manufacturing capability of high-tech products and introduction of new products. This project also supplies graduate and undergraduate students with milti-disciplinary education, which increases the country's production competition capability. Research results will benefit the scientific and engineering communities.  \r\n",
