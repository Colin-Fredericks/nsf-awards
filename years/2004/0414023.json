 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rubin\r\n\r\n     The investigator develops and applies mathematical techniques for\r\nthe study of activity patterns in conductance-based neuronal network\r\nmodels, which include biophysically relevant time scales and\r\nparameters, and in activity-based models, in which the temporal\r\nvariation in the cumulative activity of a neuronal population is\r\ntracked with a single equation.  The models analyzed include features,\r\nsuch as spatially continuous coupling, temporally varying input\r\npatterns, and heterogeneity in parameter values, that have largely\r\nbeen neglected in previous mathematical work yet which are relevant in\r\na wide range of neuronal systems.  The mathematical methods developed\r\nrelate to the derivation and subsequent analysis of subsystems of\r\nequations capturing dynamics on disparate time scales.  Further, the\r\nstudy of biophysically-based models is complemented by the development\r\nof a new and broadly applicable inverse approach, in which\r\nobservations of network dynamics is used to constrain possible\r\npatterns of connections between cells in the network in cases where\r\nthis connectivity has not been experimentally determined.\r\n\r\n     The mathematical study of neuronal network models in this project\r\nis motivated by experimental data on changes in neuronal rhythms\r\nbetween normal and parkinsonian conditions; by activity of neuronal\r\npopulations involved in navigation; and by the behavior of neurons\r\nthat help to drive respiration.  In each of these settings, networks\r\nof neurons perform particular tasks by engaging in, and switching\r\nbetween, organized firing patterns.  Correspondingly, this project\r\nelucidates the mechanisms that allow the relevant networks to support,\r\nand to modulate between, particular modes of activity.  These\r\nanalytical results lead to general conclusions about how various\r\ncomponents combine to shape neuronal network dynamics, with their\r\nparticular contributions teased apart in a way that would be difficult\r\nto achieve with a purely experimental approach.  The understanding\r\ngained is well suited to guide future biological and computational\r\nexperiments.  In particular, this project promotes an\r\ninterdisciplinary partnership with J. Smith's lab at NIH, which allows\r\nfor direct access to experimental data and testing of model\r\npredictions.  Students engaged in the work receive interdisciplinary\r\ntraining in an important area of interest to both mathematics and\r\nbiology. \r\n",
