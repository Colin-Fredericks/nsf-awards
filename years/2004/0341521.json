 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Science (61). This CCLI Educational Materials Development proof-of-concept project addresses the need to engage forest ecology students, including non-majors and future teachers, in activities that require critical thinking and scientific reasoning.  It does this by building inquiry-oriented materials that approach forestry as an environmental mystery, asking students \"Why are there no middle sized trees in this well developed forest?\" \"How often and which species of trees were logged?\" and  \"How long ago was this beaver pond abandoned?\" The software automatically records and analyzes students' observations, data and hypotheses and helps students draw inferences and revise hypotheses. The software works on a desktop computer and on a Personal Digital Assistant so students can record data and perform data analysis during field trips. The three forestry cases developed are tested for their effectiveness in a variety of post-secondary institutions and secondary schools, examining how and if inquiry learning is supported by the materials. Evaluation includes assessment of the software's usability and the consequent changes in student attitudes towards scientific reasoning. This work incorporates artificial intelligence, interactive multimedia and web-based technology in a rich, reliable and authoritative collection of teaching materials, thereby addressing the need for instruction appropriate to students of different learning styles and genders.\r\n",
