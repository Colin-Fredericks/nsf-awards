 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to work on several areas of theory. The first concerns game\r\n\r\ntheoretic/economic questions. The second concerns several questions about\r\n\r\npolynomials: zero testing, MOD complexity, and learning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will examine a variety of open problems from\r\n\r\nthese areas. Some of the open problems are classic and well known;\r\n\r\nothers are new. The mix between known problems that are often\r\n\r\ndifficult and new problems is important. Both types of problems will,\r\n\r\nwe believe, advance our understanding of these important questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first questions concern mainly non-cooperative games as well as\r\n\r\nfair division problems. These problems have often been studied for\r\n\r\nyears, but only recently have researchers looked closely at their\r\n\r\ncomputational complexity. It seems clear that the interface between\r\n\r\ngame theory and economic problems with complexity theory has\r\n\r\ntremendous potential.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second questions concern mainly classic problems from the\r\n\r\nfoundations of complexity theory. They include the power of polynomial\r\n\r\nunder various complexity restrictions and certain learning\r\n\r\nproblems. The problems are important for two reasons. They are\r\n\r\nimportant for their own sake. Further, their solution or even partial\r\n\r\nsolution is likely to yield new insights and potentially new\r\n\r\ntechniques. These could then be used to further our understanding of\r\n\r\nother problems in other parts of theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Games and economic problems are extremely\r\n\r\nchallenging. This is especially true for non-zero sum games. Their\r\n\r\ncomplex structure raises many important fundamental questions. We\r\n\r\nexpect to learn a great deal from the study of these important\r\n\r\nproblems. This is also true for the more classic questions concerning\r\n\r\npolynomials. The questions of testing, mod behavior, and learning are\r\n\r\ndifficult problems. Some have been challenging open problems for\r\n\r\ndecades. We believe that any progress on these problems will require\r\n\r\nus to use old methods in new ways and to invent new methods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The impact of the proposed research into games\r\n\r\nand economic problems is clear. Progress on the computational aspects\r\n\r\nof economic problems has a clear impact on society. As commerce\r\n\r\nbecomes more digital, it is clear that any better understanding of games\r\n\r\nand economic problems will have impact on a very broad community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work on polynomials also will have a broad impact. Some of the\r\n\r\nmost fundamental theory questions would be effected by progress on any\r\n\r\nof the proposed research. The impact would be far beyond the theory\r\n\r\ncommunity that studies these questions. It could effect other fields\r\n\r\nlike: cryptography, learning theory, and fundamental parts of\r\n\r\nmathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
