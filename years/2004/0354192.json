 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Marine and Atmospheric Research Center, SUNY Stony Brook. The program will support eight students each summer during an eight-week summer research project. Student research projects are coordinated to address a specific scientific question or gain maximum insight into a particular phenomenon pertaining to environmental conditions in Long Island Sound. The multi-disciplinary approach to scientific issues promotes teamwork and understanding. Students also participate in seminars on scientific writing and oral presentations and spend significant time in the field collecting data for their projects. The program concludes with written and verbal presentations by the students in a mini-seminar format. Funding provided support student stipends, travel, and housing as well as some administrative support and laboratory supplies for student projects.",
