 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:  Conventional wisdom asserts that elites drive opinion change in advanced  democracies (i.e. Converse 1964; Chubb, Flanigan, and Zingale 1980; Carmines and Stimson 1989).   In Canada, the behavioral ramifications of the ongoing transformation of the party system, a process  that began in 1993 after fifty years of relative stability, calls into question this assumption.  This  proposal hypothesizes that: a) vote choice in Canada is best modeled using a variant of the \"issue  priorities\" model (c.f. Budge and Farlie 1983) in which positional issues are mass rather than elite  driven; and b) tests this model against rivals contending that both positional and valence issues vary  by region (c.f. Gidengil et al. 1999); and c) a multidimensional variation of the spatial model with  both positional and valence issues (c.f. Groseclose 2001).   \r\nTo test these models, pseudo-panels employing national samples of the Canadian electorate generated  in a number of cross-sectional and panel studies since the 1980s will be employed.  These include  both studies of national elections and studies conducted in the interim between elections.  A variety of  multivariate statistical techniques such as modeling both partisanship and ideology on a latent variable  level and making use of multinomial probit techniques will assess the validity of the hypotheses.    \r\nAdvances in adapting these quantitative approaches for use in the analysis of political behavior will  enable the modeling of the stability of both ideology and partisanship within the multi-wave panels  while controlling for measurement error (e.g. Green, Palmquist, and Schickler 2002).  These  measurement techniques will also provide insight as to whether the much noted unstable nature of  partisanship in Canada (c.f. Meisel 1975; Clarke et al. 1996; Clarke et al. 2000) was \"time bound\" and  a byproduct of the party system that existed before 1993.  Since the set of parties available to the  Canadian voter differs from region to region, and even between neighboring ridings, the  \"independence of irrelevant alternatives\" (IIA) assumption is likely violated in standard analyses of  voting behavior in Canada (Greene 2003).  If this is the case estimation of modeling parameters will  be done using Breslaw's (2002) GAUSSX multinomial probit procedure.      Since the Canadian national election of 1993, two new parties, the Bloc Quebecois (BQ) and the  Reform/Alliance have become major players in national electoral politics, whereas two old-line  parties, the Progressive Conservatives (PC) and the left-of-center New Democratic Party (NDP) have  become distinctly minority participants in national elections.  However, a merger has been arranged  between the old-line Tory and the Alliance who will henceforth run under the label, Conservative  Party of Canada (CPC).  The models to be tested have the additional merit of analyzing and explaining  whether the proposed merger of these two parties will be consummated, and also whether the merged  party will be successful in the sense of either winning the next election or seriously challenging the  governing Liberals.    Funding will be utilized to add several questions to a pre-post study of an election anticipated during  spring 2004 that is being undertaken by Dr. Allan Kornberg.  Additional funds are sought for a mail- back questionnaire that will employ issue questions that are pertinent to the investigation of the  hypotheses and the testing of the above models.  The pre-post telephone interviews will constitute the  fourth and fifth wave of a panel begun by Dr. Kornberg with a pre-post 2000 election study and a  2002 interim study.       \r\n b)  Broader Impact:  The study will be the first to systematically assess whether the so-called  \"Absent Mandate\" model (c.f. Clarke et al. 1996) that has largely driven the study of Canadian  elections since the 1970's is time bound and in need of serious revision given the changes that  hypothesized to have occurred at both the elite and mass level of one of the world oldest, continuing  democracies.   \r\n",
