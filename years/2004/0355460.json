 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ira Flatow has been producing SCIENCE FRIDAY for over a decade.  The series is now rated among the top ten news programs carried by NPR and is carried by over 200 stations.  In spite of this success, the audience, though large, is limited to those people who can listen on Friday afternoon.  In addition, the program is not carried on some stations because it does not fit their weekday program format.  However, in conversations with many station managers, Flatow has learned that many stations that do not now carry the series do understand the value of science to their listeners and would include a science program in their schedules if one were made available to them for broadcast on weekends.  The purpose of this planning proposal is to develop the parameters for a SCIENCE WEEKEND series.  Since weekend programming many times is not like programming on weekdays, it will be necessary to find out more about the length and format that stations most prefer and to establish key partnerships to assure the broadest impact of a weekend program. \r\n\r\nSpecific tasks to be conducted in the planning phase include:\r\n\r\n1.\tSurveying public radio stations about their preferences for format, length, and broadcast day for SCIENCE WEEKEND\r\n2.\tIdentifying key programming elements to be included in a pilot program\r\n3.\tRecording, editing and producing a pilot program\r\n4.\tGetting assessments of the pilot from public radio station managers and programmers\r\n5.\tEvaluating the pilot with members of the target audience\r\n6.\tSecuring a network partner to serve as a distributor for the program\r\n7.\tCreating partnerships with teaching and other educational institutions to participate in the outreach efforts of the project\r\n8.\tDeveloping an evaluation strategy to assess the impact of SCIENCE WEEKEND on the audience\r\n\r\n",
