These collimated, relativistic jets of plasma are powered by supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGN), and undergo complex evolution due to interactions between their external medium, internal magnetic fields, and inherent fluid instabilities.  The observing project involves the investigator and his students, and collaborators at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, the University of Michigan, and Denison University.  Various data will be used by the investigator and students to study poorly-known long-term jet properties, including nozzle precession, stationary features, and the magnetic and kinematic evolution of features.  Simulations will characterize selection effects in the sample and determine the intrinsic speed distribution of the parent population from the observed speeds.  Statistical tests will look for correlations between the speeds and polarization characteristics of the jets, leading to a better understanding of how magnetic fields influence the kinematics of relativistic flows.\r\n\r\nThe project will significantly broaden the research opportunities available to undergraduate physics majors at Purdue and Denison University.  Participating students will learn valuable research and computer skills by working on data from a cutting edge astronomical facility, and will be encouraged to present their results at scientific meetings.  The investigator will develop peer-instruction activities for large-enrollment introductory astronomy courses taught at Purdue University.  Even broader impact will be achieved through development of materials to be used in the Purdue K-12 physics outreach program in the state of Indiana, and by maintaining a large internet database, an important resource for the community.\r\n",
