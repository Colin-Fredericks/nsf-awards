 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cornell University Library and the Gottingen State and University Library propose to create a distributed, interoperable system for the long-term preservation and dissemination of digital serial literature in the field of Mathematics and Statistics. Developing and implementing such a system will require the partners  to bring the principles of the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model to an operational level by establishing protocols for data ingest, data management, archival storage, archive administration, and access processes.  Persistent access to distributed archives is an important goal for digital libraries research. Distributed archives will allow libraries and institutions to invest their resources in expanding content for targeted communities rather than in developing costly local infrastructure.   Persistent access means that users can trust a digital archive will provide secure, reliable access to resources over time without constraints based upon geographic location, language preferences or requirements, or subject discipline. The OAIS reference model has received a great deal of positive attention in the archiving and preservation communities, and it has become a dominant and accepted model for planning and implementing digital archives.  By creating an open digital archive of serial mathematics literature this joint US/Germany project will make valuable content reliably accessible to a host of other disciplines for which mathematics is an enabling science.",
