 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\nKasparov\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this project are applications of operator \r\nK-theory to a number of well known problems in topology, harmonic \r\nanalysis and index theory. These problems are the Novikov conjecture on \r\nhigher signatures of smooth manifolds, the Baum-Connes conjecture in \r\nK-theory of group C*-algebras, the problem of multiplicities of \r\nautomorphic forms, index theory for transversally elliptic operators. \r\nOperator K-theory has its origins in the index theory of elliptic \r\noperators, and it is most natural to study elliptic operators, \r\nincluding transversally elliptic operators, using operator K-theory. \r\nAlso operator K-theory is a very suitable tool in applications related \r\nto geometric group actions, which makes it exceptionally useful for \r\nproblems like the Novikov and the Baum-Connes conjectures. \r\nMultiplicities of automorphic forms is another topic where operator \r\nK-theory gives new approaches to old problems.\r\n\r\nThe development of quantum mechanics in the 20th century has led to the \r\ncreation  of the theory of operators in Hilbert space and later to the \r\ncreation of the theory of C*-algebras. The theory of C*-algebras is \r\nclosely related with the contemporary field theory in physics, as well \r\nas with geometry, topology, Lie group representation theory, etc. \r\nOperator K-theory came to the C*-algebra theory from topology and grew \r\nout into a highly powerful tool. Nowadays, operator K-theory is part of \r\nthe non-commutative geometry which is a synthesis of analysis and \r\ngeometry with wide applications in many areas of mathematics and \r\ntheoretical physics. The emphasis of the present project is on the \r\napplications of operator K-theory to several well known problems in \r\nanalysis and topology. \r\n\r\n",
