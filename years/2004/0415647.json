 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Michael Morse of the University of Utah will investigate the chemical bonding and electronic structures of diatomic transition metal molecules and polyatomic metal cluster oxides, nitrides, and carbides by means of electronic spectroscopy.  The methods include resonant two-photon ionization spectroscopy, laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy, and dispersed fluorescence spectroscopy.  Diatomic molecules to be investigated include Pd2, VMo, NbMo, Re2, Hf2, Os2, Ir2, ScAu, TiAu, VAu, PtAu, and AuSi. Examples of polyatomic metal clusters are the triatomic species AlNAl, AlOAl, Al2Cl, Si2O, and AlSiO.  The goal is to obtain detailed structural information about these species, including bond lengths, bond angles, vibrational frequencies, dissociation energies, ground and excited electronic state symmetries and spin multiplicities, etc.  The spectroscopy of molecules with heavy transition metal atoms is challenging owing to the simultaneous presence of relativistic and electron correlation effects.  These features make it very difficult to study such molecules even with the most modern quantum chemical methods.  This research promises to provide accurate experimental data that will serve as benchmarks for the development of appropriate quantum chemical theories.  Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this research.  They will thereby acquire knowledge and skills in preparation for advanced studies or entry into the scientific/technological workforce.",
