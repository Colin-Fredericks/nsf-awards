However in some cases \r\nwhen calculating estimates the design weights need to be readjusted, and \r\nthen it can be difficult to find  sensible estimates of variance.\r\nIn the Bayesian approach prior information is incorporated  through\r\na prior distribution. Since the posterior distribution does not depend \r\non the design it has been  difficult to theoretically reconcile the \r\ntwo approaches. The Polya posterior is an objective  Bayesian approach \r\nto finite population sampling that is appropriate when little\r\nor no prior information is available. The investigator is developing \r\na synthesis of this objective Bayesian approach and the design\r\nbased approach. It has two main threads. In the first the Polya \r\nposterior is extended to problems where it cannot be applied directly \r\nbecause of additional prior information contained in  auxiliary\r\nvariables. This leads to a constrained or restricted\r\nversion of the Polya posterior. In the second Bayesian models are\r\ndeveloped which directly include the design in the specification of the \r\nprior. Such models are a generalization of the Polya \r\nposterior and using them one  can objectively incorporate \r\ninto a prior the same kind of information that is encapsulated in a design.\r\nThe investigator is developing the underlying theory and methods to\r\nsimulate from these  objective posteriors so that  estimators can be \r\nfound in practice and their frequentist properties studied. \r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most basic problems of statistics is making an inference  \r\nabout a population based on a sample collected from the population.\r\nWhen little is known about the population the  mean of the\r\nvalues in a random sample is used as an estimate of the population\r\nmean. However in addition to the estimate one also needs a \r\nsensible measure of its uncertainty or variance. In most\r\nsituations there is prior information available about the population. \r\nThis information should be used in deciding what units are to be \r\nincluded in the sample, the value of the estimate and the appropriate \r\nmeasure of uncertainty. The investigator is working on a synthesis \r\nof the two standard approaches to these problems.  The results should make \r\nmore effective use of available prior information than present methods.\r\nBecause of the many surveys done each year by  government and others \r\nimproving survey practice is of great practical significance.\r\n\r\n",
