 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the study of organic nanoparticles prepared using an arrested precipitation method called \"solvent shifting.\" This plan will involve study of fundamental aspects of the nucleation and growth of the nanoparticles, especially the role of diffusion in supersaturated solutions and the connection to solution crystallization. Mechanisms of the particle growth will be determined in order to develop methods of stabilization and separation from the solvent. Organic nanoparticles will be used in a number of innovative applications such as polymer nanoparticles with narrow size distributions, nanocomposite light emitting diodes, and nanoscale electronic components. The plan is integrated with undergraduate training in optics and materials, both through research participation and the development of an online optics reference book. This reference book will have several innovative features, including distributed authorship and the use of active learning by undergraduates in the creation and revision of the material and the delivery of multiple levels of content. A significant undergraduate participation in the organic nanoparticle research is also planned, along with further development of a novel graduate program in industrial physics. \r\n%%%\r\nThe main goal of this research project is to gain a better understanding of the underlying processes of aggregation and self-assembly of organic molecules. A number of novel optical characterization methods will be used to do this, including fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, which looks at optical emission from small groups of, or even single molecules, and diffusion measurements in microfabricated mixing cells. There are many potential applications for these types of organic nanoparticles, ranging from novel optical materials to biocompatible drug formulations. Several applications will be explored: polymer dispersions with well-controlled sizes and shapes, composites of nanoparticles for optical displays, and nano-electronics using chains of organic nanoparticles. The plan is integrated with undergraduate training in optics and materials, both through research participation and the development of a novel online optics reference book. This reference book will have several innovative features, including distributed authorship and the use of active learning by undergraduates in the creation and revision of the material and the delivery of multiple levels of content.\r\n***\r\n",
