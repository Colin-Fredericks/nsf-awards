 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIntellectual Merit: This CSEMS program builds on an existing proven and successful cross-school CSEMS program.   The program is making a positive impact on on-time graduations by permitting full time enrollments; having a marked effect on reducing students' loan indebtedness;  broadening students' educational experiences within their discipline by involving all the students in one-on-one mentoring with faculty in the student's major (many involving research experiences) and outside their major by involving the students with faculty and staff who participate in enhancement programs designed specifically for the scholarship holders.  The Program also works to ensure the continuing academic success of the students by expanding and enhancing long-term, well developed, institutional student support infrastructure in the participating schools.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The participating schools have large numbers of students who fit the CSEMS eligibility criteria.  A careful nomination and selection procedure is used to ensure that program goals are met.  In addition to long established in-place campus support programs, scholarship recipients also have a faculty mentor in their major, and this may include a mentored research experience.  In addition there are activities offered that focus on graduate school and employment opportunities in the high technology sector.  The established Purdue University CSEMS Program Web Site and the use of E-mail ensure that there is good communication between the students and staff.",
