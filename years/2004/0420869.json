 "awd_abstract_narration": "This work, constructing laboratory-scale Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices and interconnecting them via a simulation engine, studies and reduces potential deleterious effects, such as congestion or insecure operation, that may quickly propagate across the grid in complex and dramatic ways resulting in wide-spread blackouts. The FACTS device family of switched power electronics-based controllers, presently constitutes one of the most promising new sets of power controllers. These devices control the power flow through the lines of the network by rapidly injecting independent current and voltages into the system. This FACTS network provides a testbed for simultaneously testing both the FACTS hardware and the distributed fault-tolerant and secure software. The FACTS device laboratory studies reliability of the power grid, allowing experimental verification for the dynamics and control of multiple FACTS devices within the system. The controllers, built to regulate and manage the flow of electricity in high power energy grids, form an essential part of the constructed scaleable network of FACTS. Thus, various failure propagation effects in the power grid are under study to manage and control the flow of energy. A laboratory-scale FACTS testbed studies how devices behave under different scenarios. While validating various algorithms using actual devices, researchers conduct emulation experiments on real hardware to test the correctness of control algorithms under development. FACT devices provide the necessary capabilities to build an adaptive power grid. Presently, there is little deployment of such devices; hence, insufficient experience with them. This project is expected to provide such experience to the industry. Additionally, the network provides a unique testbed with which to develop distributed embedded control software.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The lab facilitates exploration of new power control technologies that might result in better use of transmission facilities, thus having long-term effects for the entire community. It also provides a physical testbed for advanced courseware, enriching the environment for both students and their advisors. The equipment will also be used, as part of the institutions minority program, to encourage under-represented groups to participate in the project research and will be made available to other research collaborators at minimal cost. Visualization of the power grid control on the web makes the work accessible to scientists and engineers, policy decision makers, and the general public. \r\n\r\nThe funds requested include the equipment listed below and associated expenses.\r\n\tUPFC, Test equipment, Xeon 4 processor, maintenance\r\n\tSome students involved in the development\r\n",
