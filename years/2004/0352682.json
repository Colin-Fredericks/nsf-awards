 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to study arithmetic questions arising in the \r\ntheory of automorphic forms and linear algebraic groups, especially in \r\nthe context of the Langlands program. As an example, it is well-known that \r\na wealth of arithmetic information is contained in the Fourier \r\ncoefficients of a classical modular form on the upper half plane. \r\nThe investigator has an ongoing project (with B. Gross and G. Savin) \r\nto develope a theory of Fourier coefficients for certain modular forms on \r\nthe exceptional group G2 and to extract arithmetic information from these \r\ncoefficients. The investigator is also  \r\ninterested in constructing and classifying arithmetically interesting \r\ncusp forms on reductive groups, and relating them to certain \r\ninfluential conjectures of Arthur. He intends to exploit the exceptional \r\ntheta correspondence for the construction of some of these cusp forms.\r\n\r\nThe theory of automorphic forms is one of the main themes of modern \r\nmathematical research. Besides being a beautiful subject in its own \r\nright, it is intimately connected with other important areas of \r\nmathematics such as number theory (the study of \r\nproperties of numbers, with applications to cryptography)\r\nand representation theory (the study of symmetries, with applications to \r\nphysics). Often, it has surprising applications to concrete problems, such \r\nas the construction of Ramanujan graphs which are of great interest\r\nin communication and network theory. Particularly important and elusive in \r\nthe theory of automrophic forms are certain primitive objects known as \r\ncusp forms. The investigator hopes to further our understanding of \r\nthese basic objects by giving explicit constructions of some of them.",
