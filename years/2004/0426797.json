Research activities covered by this award fall under the National Priority Area, \"Advances in Science and Engineering,\" and the Technical Focus Area, \"Integration of computing, networking, human-computer interfaces, and information management to support reliable, complex, distributed, systems.\" \r\n\r\nThis project will develop software for time-of-flight neutron scattering data visualization and analysis.  The software will extend the capabilities of the Integrated Spectral Analysis Workbench (ISAW) developed in collaboration with the IPNS division of Argonne National Laboratory to work with data from multiple instruments and facilities using the NeXus file standard for neutron scattering data.  In addition, the project will develop improved data visualization tools and data reduction operators for powder, glass, liquid and amorphous material diffractometers.  The project staff will collaborate with scientists from Argonne, Los Alamos and Oak Ridge National Laboratories.  The award also supports collaboration wth the DANSE (Distributed Data Analysis for Neutron Scattering Experiments) team from the California Institute of Technology.  The collaboration will develop ways for ISAW to interact with next generation software being developed for the SNS.  The software development team will include a diverse group of undergraduate students who will participate fully in the design and development of the software.\r\n%%%\r\nThis award was made on a proposal submitted to the Division of Materials Research under the Information Technology Research solicitation NSF-04-012. Research activities covered by this award fall under the National Priority Area, \"Advances in Science and Engineering,\" and the Technical Focus Area, \"Integration of computing, networking, human-computer interfaces, and information management to support reliable, complex, distributed, systems.\" \r\n\r\nTime-of-flight neutron scattering techniques provide a critical tool for studying the structure and dynamics of materials.  These experiments often produce large data sets with hundreds of megabytes of data.  This project will develop portable user-friendly software for visualizing and analyzing such data.  The software will support data from multiple instruments and facilities, including the new Spallation Neutron Source being constructed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  The project will support collaboration with the SNS and with the distributed Data Analysis of Neutron Scattering Experiments project at the California Institute of Technology.  In addition to developing the software, this project will contribute to training future software engineers and scientists.  The software development team will include a diverse group of undergraduate students who will participate fully in the design and development of the software.\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n",
