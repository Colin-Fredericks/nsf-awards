The requested support is for the\r\nexpenses of the four invited speakers, students, recent doctoral recipients, \r\nand some of the direct costs of operating the conference. \r\n  \r\nThe proposed conference will focus on computational and theoretical \r\naspects of nonlinear waves and optical fiber communication systems. \r\nNonlinear wave equations describe a wide class of physical phenomena in \r\nplasma physics, anharmonic crystals, bubble-liquid mixtures, fiber optics, etc. \r\nIt is to be noted that fiber optics communications has experienced tremendous\r\ngrowth in the last twenty years. In the last decade alone, data rates have \r\nincreased by orders of magnitude. At the same time, the recent rise of the \r\nInternet and the World-Wide Web has quickly contributed to make this area one \r\nof the key technological sectors in the national and global economy, and has \r\ngenerated an unprecedented demand for even higher transmission capacities.\r\nAt the conference, researchers will present recent research in the broad area \r\nthat include theory and computations of solitons.\r\nIn addition, research will be presented that uses high performance computers\r\nfor solving computationally intensive problems. \r\nThis conference will build on the success of the previous year's conference. \r\nIn 2003, at the third conference in this series, more than 135 research papers \r\nwere presented. This includes contributed papers and papers presented in \r\norganized sessions. In addition, a tutorial on `Introduction to Optical Fiber \r\nCommunication Systems' was given. Six invited speakers, ten students and \r\n1 post-doc were fully or partially supported by the grant. Three `best paper' \r\nawards were give to graduate students. More than 13 students and post-docs as \r\nwell as 11 women have participated in the conference. A good number of \r\nscientists from the Naval research laboratories as well as the Los Alamos \r\nNational laboratories were present. We expect an even greater representation \r\nof women at the fourth conference, and we are working hard to increase the \r\nrepresentation of minorities and persons with disabilities.\r\nThis conference is expected to have a substantial impact on the quality of the\r\nresearch and teaching in the major areas of discourse which is due to its\r\ninterdisciplinary nature as well as to the high quality of the invited \r\nspeakers and participants. Participants from Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry,\r\nComputer Science, Engineering and Industry were present at the previous \r\nconferences. \r\n\r\n",
