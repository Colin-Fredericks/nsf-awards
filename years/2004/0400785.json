Joshi\r\n\r\nA powerful influx of methods and ideas from geometry into the\r\nrepresentation theory led to significant breakthroughs and\r\nstimulated the emergence of geometric representation theory as an\r\nimportant area of research in modern mathematics. Geometric\r\nmethods have been utilized to explore many significant problems\r\nin representation theory. The Langlands program provides an\r\nexample of the synthesis of representation theory, arithmetic and\r\ngeometry. In its arithmetic avatar the Langlands correspondence\r\nenvisages a description of certain kinds of representations of\r\nthe Galois group of a number field or a function field in terms\r\nof automorphic representations. The geometric avatar of the\r\nLanglands correspondence pioneered by Drinfel'd and Laumon has\r\nalso attracted a lot of attention and has turned out to be a\r\nconfluence of several areas of mathematics: representation\r\ntheory, D-modules, Kac-Moody and vertex algebras and integrable\r\nsystems, Hitchin maps to name a few. Representation theory has\r\nbeen omnipresent in theoretical physics and conversely, problems\r\nand developments in physics motivated much progress in\r\nrepresentation theory which, in turn, was a significant input\r\ninto other branches of mathematics.  Conformal Field Theory led\r\nto intensive study of the representation theory of the Virasoro\r\nalgebra, Kac-Moody algebras and vertex operator algebras. Results\r\nin representation theory have had a significant impact on the\r\nunderstanding of the structure of moduli spaces.  In the theory\r\nof integrable systems it has been observed long ago in numerous\r\nexamples that physically meaningful completely integrable systems\r\nas well as explicit formulas for the integrals of motion are\r\nintimately related with the geometric representation theory. All\r\nthese developments serve as our motivation to organize a\r\nconference on geometric representation theory, a forum where the\r\nmajority of participants will be young researchers and advanced\r\ngraduate students, learning from leading specialists and further\r\nadvancing their research projects.\r\n\r\nRepresentation theory is a quintessential branch of modern\r\nmathematics which studies symmetries of various algebraic\r\nsystems. The results and ideas from representation theory found\r\nmany important applications in pure and applied mathematics as\r\nwell as quantum physics, biology, economics, just to name a\r\nfew. More recently a powerful merge of ideas from geometry made a\r\nsignificant impact on the discipline and led to important\r\nbreakthroughs. The main goal of our conference is to gather\r\nleading specialists in representation theory as well as beginning\r\nresearchers and advanced graduate students, to create a forum\r\nwhere participants can exchange new ideas, communicate recent\r\nadvances and assist younger participants in developing successful\r\nresearch strategies. A special emphasis is made on attracting\r\nwomen and underrepresented minority participants, especially\r\nthose at the dawn of their careers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
