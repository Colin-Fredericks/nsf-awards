 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIt has been recognized that living cells represent biologically evolved systems possessing all the\r\nattributes of smart materials. In some sense they represent the ultimate smart material. The major\r\nchallenge in using living cells as highly sensitive selective and reliable sensors arises on how to transduce\r\nthe biological changes of the cells under specific conditions into quantitative (or measurable) physical\r\nparameters. In this project, we propose a three-years research effort to develop a Love-mode surface\r\nacoustic wave (SAW) biosensor that can be used to quantitatively probe the behavior of living cell\r\nattachment, spreading, and growth kinetics under various biological conditions. The ultimate goal is to\r\ndemonstrate that the Love-mode SAW device can provide an electromechanical mechanism for high\r\nsensitive signal transduction that allows us to access the cells that attach on the surface of the device as\r\nthe biological element in this living cellLove-mode SAW biosensor system.\r\nThe specific aims of this project are: 1) To design, modeling and characterize highly sensitive Love-\r\nmode SAW devices; 2) to develop a SAW sensor system consisting of a SAW sensor array, a mini-\r\nincubation system, and a microscope system; and 3) to show the functionality of this novel sensor system\r\nby investigating adhesive/contractile activities of human tendon fibroblasts. This project will involve\r\nmodeling, design, fabrication, characterization, and biological evaluation of a novel cytosensor system.\r\nBroader Impact of This Project:\r\nWhen completed, this project will provide a novel sensor system that will be capable of\r\nsimultaneously measuring multiple samples with a high degree of sensitivity. This study will also have\r\nsubstantial impact on the current biosensor research and development, and will greatly promote the use of\r\nliving cells as transduction devices. The novel sensor system will be a powerful tool to study cell\r\nbiological events in a real-time, quick, easy, quantitative, and high throughput fashion, and will have wide\r\npotential applications not only in biomedical research but also in monitoring environmental contaminants,\r\ndrug screening and efficacy testing, bacteria and virus testing in the food industry and for anti-\r\nbioterrorism applications.\r\nThe education aspects of this program will include interdisciplinary research training of both graduate\r\nand undergraduate researchers; hands-on research training opportunities for K-12 students in each\r\nsummer semester through the Pitt Engineering Career Access Program (PECAP); and summer research\r\ntraining for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups through Summer Engineering Academy\r\n(SEA) program coordinated by the Diversity and Minority Engineering Programs. The research activities\r\nproposed in this project will be incorporated into new courses for both undergraduate and graduate\r\nstudent as advanced topics.",
