 "awd_abstract_narration": "The symposium on the \"Solid State Chemistry of Inorganic Materials V\" will be a comprehensive meeting focusing on recent advances in the areas of Solid State Chemistry. It intends to address important issues concerning fundamental and practical aspects and to provide participants with opportunities to interact, to discuss new phenomena, and to exchange new ideas and thoughts on topics in Solid State Chemistry and their impact on the development and applications of inorganic materials. The research activities of invited speakers reflect the multidisciplinary and forefront of these areas. The symposium will also project, in a dynamic way, the high relevance of solid-state chemistry to materials science and, of course, the MRS meeting is the proper forum to do so.\r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this symposium will be to promote interactions and collaborations\r\namong researchers, to foster new knowledge and new discoveries in this exciting and growing field, and to build connections between new researchers (e.g. undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs) and established individuals of the community.\r\nIt is noteworthy that research programs now prominent in other symposia at the annual\r\nMRS meetings were incubated previously in \"Solid State Chemistry of Inorganic\r\nMaterials.\" These include magneto-optical materials, materials for fuel cells, materials\r\nfor hydrogen storage, bio-inspired materials, and organic-inorganic hybrid materials.\r\nThat a joint session with Solid State Ionics has been held for several years also attests to the broad reach of solid-state chemistry of inorganic materials into a variety of other disciplines.\r\n",
