The PI is interested in the free boundary\r\nproblems with nonlocal structure, where velocities of the free boundaries\r\ndepend on global characteristics of the solutions. The goal is to gain a\r\nbetter understanding of the following aspects of such problems: the\r\nexistence and uniqueness of solutions in global time; asymptotic behavior\r\nof the free boundary as time reaches zero or infinity; waiting time\r\nphenomena; and the regularity properties of the free boundaries. The PI\r\nemploys the notion of viscosity solutions to address the behavior of\r\naformentioned free boundary problems. This approach has been succesfully\r\nused to study nonlinear PDEs and local laws of motions such as 'motion by\r\nmean curvature'. The great advantage of this approach is its seamless\r\nhandling of topological transitions such as pinch-off. The key-step of the\r\ntheory of viscosity solutions is to establish a comparison principle. This\r\nproperty leads, in turn, to the existence of solutions and allows for the\r\nfurther study of their properties. Techniques coming from quantitative\r\nversions of the comparison principle and harmonic analysis are employed to\r\nstudy further properties of solutions.\r\n\r\nThe classical Stefan problem of melting ice is an example of the free\r\nboundary problems. In the Stefan problem, one is modeling the evolution of\r\nthe polar ice caps, and the question of interest is the location, as a\r\nfunction of time, of the interface between water and ice. The particular\r\nproblems to which the methods of the present proposal apply also include:\r\nthe\r\nHele-Shaw problem which models fluid motion in a narrow cell between\r\ntwo parallel plates; flame fronts; and the interface between oil and\r\nwater in a flow. This is an area where modeling and computation are far\r\nahead of mathematical analysis. The main obstacle for developing a\r\nwell-defined notion for general motion of interfaces is that initially\r\nsmooth boundaries moving under smooth velocities may develop singularities\r\nin finite time. The hitting and splitting of interfaces in flame\r\npropagation is an example. It is natural to wonder whether the\r\ncontinuation of the solutions is uniquely determined after pinch-off, or\r\nwhether additional constitutive information might be required at the\r\nsingular time. The impact of the singularity to the other part of the free\r\nboundary is another interesting question.  The PI plans to investigate\r\nthese questions in local and global perspectives.\r\n",
