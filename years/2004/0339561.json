 "awd_abstract_narration": "0339561\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I Project entails development of a \r\nnovel on-chip electronic encoding bead-array detection system for  simultaneous \r\nmultiplexed detection of pathogenic agents. This technology will offer a quick and highly \r\nsensitive identification method for pathogens or toxins. Most current systems for the fast \r\ndetection of pathogens are based on fluorescent dye labeling and optical detection of the \r\nsignal, which are prone to photobleaching and are likely  to fall short  when multiplex \r\ndetection is required.  This new  electronic encoding and chip-based system is highly flexible\r\nand can be used for direct detection and identification of whole pathogens,  toxins  or DNA/RNA.\r\n\r\nThe method will have a broad impact on a number of bioanalytical fields because it will be capable of rapid, highly sensitive and multiplexed identification of pathogens or their toxins. The proposed research will have broad impact and applications in molecular diagnostics, and detection of infectious disease and biological agents.  The applications will range from the detection of pathogens and biological warfare agents in environmental, agricultural and medical samples to infectious disease in clinical, molecular diagnostic and forensic applications.",
