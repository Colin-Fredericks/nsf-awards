 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the Department of Chemistry at Towson University will acquire an X-ray fluorescence spectrometer and a carbon-nitrogen analyzer with a solid sample combustion unit. The specific projects that will be carried out using this equipment will address the following questions:  What is the relative importance of soil-derived trace elements to the total trace element budget of the Chesapeake Bay?   How does the elemental stoichiometry of food sources impact the growth of stream invertebrates along an urban to rural gradient?  Can constructed wetlands be effectively used for the removal of fertilizer-derived nitrogen from intermittent runoff events.  What role do biofilms play in the transfer of trace elements to wildlife in storm water retention ponds?   \r\n\r\nThese instruments were chosen because their software interfaces are approachable for students at the undergraduate level.  The carbon and nitrogen analyses are fast, which means that students can accomplish more analyses and take on more sample-intensive projects within the constraints of their schedules.  These instruments will also be utilized in numerous courses and will play a role in the newly developed Forensic Chemistry program.  They will be used for undergraduate research by students in Chemistry, Environmental Science, Biology and Geology, and will serve to support masters-level research in Environmental Science and Biology.  \r\n",
