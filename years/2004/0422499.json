 "awd_abstract_narration": "The California community College Transfer Scholarship Consortium (CCCTSC) continues a Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics Scholarships (CSEMS) program in awarding an additional 80 scholarships to qualifying students by continuing to: (1) provide additional incentives to help them maintain full-time educational commitments and continuous collegiate enrollment; (2) minimize pressures to fulfill outside employment responsibilities that impose difficulties on academic success' (3) provide early access to practical career related experiences through internships and research opportunities, and; (4) foster meaningful opportunities for team building, collaboration and workplace socialization.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: \r\nCSEMS responds to broader societal concerns voiced by policy leaders and eminent industrialists. \r\nThe demand for trained professionals clearly exists. CSEMS addresses the supply side of the equation to help mitigate current and future skill shortages, while providing new pathways to students, families, and communities separated from the scope of opportunity offered by the technological world. Approximately one-third (33) of California's 108 Community College's and 80% of its accredited engineering institutions are partners in the Consortium. Due to the statewide impact of the Consortium, CSEMS is rapidly becoming a core component of the MESA Statewide undergraduate community college and university infrastructure. The comprehensive student support infrastructure (MESA/Consortium) has been institutionalized at each participating university and community college to increase retention and transfer services for the 2003-04 scholars. The Consortium is the nation's largest producer of CSEMS scholars. Of the 277 CSEMS Grants (colleges and consortiums) awarded nationally, the Consortium successfully transferred 24 % of the Latino scholars and 55 % of the computer engineering scholars. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nIn support of the efforts of this project, universities and community colleges are providing joint advising sessions for pending transfers to enhance transfer articulation. Success in demystifying transfer articulation for thousands of potential transfers in CSEM disciplines will improve California's transfer rates. The Consortium continues to foster an environment for local industries to cultivate, recruit and employ technical talent enrolled at the community colleges.\r\n",
