 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nuclear structure research program at the University of Kentucky is focussed on timely, related topics in nuclear spectroscopy, neutron-induced reactions, and neutron scattering.  Experimental work is designed to take advantage of the neutron production capabilities at the University's accelerator facility and the unique detection systems that have been developed in this laboratory; however, complementary, collaborative research with colleagues at other institutions is also pursued.  Nuclear structure studies are primarily oriented toward exploring multiphonon vibrational excitations in nearly spherical nuclei, examining magnetic and electric dipole transitions in collective excitations, defining the roles of protons and neutrons in collective modes, and understanding nuclear shell structure and the nature of nuclear shape transitions. The characterization of mixed-symmetry states, new types of collective modes, in weakly deformed nuclei and phonon-coupled excitations of these states is a high priority.  Neutron scattering studies, which aid in elucidating the differences between neutron excitation and other probes, will complement studies of the microscopic basis of collective excitations.  The study of isospin symmetry in medium-mass nuclei is a new research direction.  Nuclear level lifetime measurements with the Doppler-shift attenuation method and gamma-gamma coincidence measurements, for which the methodologies have been developed in our laboratory, will play crucial roles in many of these studies. Carefully selected experiments in other areas which are particularly appropriate to the capabilities and facilities at the University of Kentucky accelerator laboratory will be pursued.  The education of nuclear science students at the undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels is emphasized, and efforts to provide a diverse working environment at the University of Kentucky are an ongoing, vital component of the program",
