A new method for characterizing the transport pathways of gases through zeolite membrane pores is being developed. This method measures the adsorption isotherms, heats of adsorption, diffusivities, and effective thickness of these pathways non-destructively. Transient permeation measurements with mass spectrometric detection will be used for gas mixtures. A mathematical model of the mixture transient behavior will be developed and used to analyze transient experimental results for mixtures. Measuring the adsorption and transport properties of mixtures under conditions where the membranes are used for separations is critical for understanding the separation behavior of these novel membranes.  Several types of zeolite membranes with a range of pore sizes and thickness will be prepared as membranes for these transient studies. Transient experiments will be carried out for single gases and for mixtures. In terms of the broader impacts, transient permeation measurements have the potential to significantly increase our understanding of the relationship between zeolite membranes structure and separation performance.  Understanding the adsorption and transport properties and the role of the support will allow systems to be designed for a given separation. This research will prepare graduate students in preparation and characterization of zeolite membranes. Undergraduates will also be involved in this research through the department's REU site grant on functional materials.  \r\n\r\n",
