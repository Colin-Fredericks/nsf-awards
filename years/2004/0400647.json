 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for award DMS-0400647 of Wan\r\n\r\nThe central aim of this proposal is to give a systematic \r\nstudy of the p-adic variation of zeta functions of toric hypersurfaces over \r\nfinite fields. This naturally has three aspects: theory, applications and \r\nalgorithms. We expect to make significant progresses on all three fronts. \r\nOn the theoretical side, the PI previously proved that Dwork's unit root zeta \r\nfunction is p-adic meromorphic but no information about its zeros is known  \r\nexcept in the simpler abelian rank one case. We propose to obtain effective \r\ninformation about zeros of the unit root zeta function in the general \r\nnon-abelian higher rank case, settling this basic problem. This should be \r\nrelated to the conjectural  non-abelian p-adic L-functions and geometric \r\nIwasawa theory. As a consequence, we shall give a detailed in-depth \r\nstudy of some important examples such as a family of Kloosterman sums and \r\na family of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces, settling some open problems in the area. \r\nOn the application side, we propose to investigate the arithmetic mirror symmetry: \r\nthe relation between the zeta function of a Calabi-Yau variety and  the zeta function \r\nof its mirror variety. An experimental/computational study along this direction has already \r\nbeen made by Candelas etc who disovered some interesting structures about such \r\nzeta functions via the study of the periods of the Picard-Fuch equations. \r\nWe propose to give a rigorous mathematical proof of their conjectures. \r\nRecently, along this line, we proposed several apparently harder arithmetic mirror \r\nconjectures, including the generic slope mirror conjecture and the small slope \r\nmirror conjecture. We plan to make these conjectures precise in a general form \r\nand provide substantial evidence to them, opening new areas of research.\r\nAlong the way, the link between our decomposition theorems for generic Newton \r\npolygons and the GKZ principal discriminant would be established, obtaining \r\narithmetic information about the GKZ discriminant. For the algorithmic side, \r\nwe plan to exploit some of the finer p-adic theory and computational commutative \r\nalgebra to obtain faster and better p-adic algorithms for the zeta functions, \r\nincluding the harder singular case. The proposed research would involve several \r\ncolloborators and graduate students. \r\n\r\nA fundamental problem in number theory is to understand the number of solutions \r\nof a polynomial equation over a finite field. In addition to its intrinsic \r\ntheoretic interest, this problem has connections to several major branches of \r\nmathematics. It also has important applications in coding theory, crpyptography, \r\nand combinatorics. We propose to give a systematic study of this fundamental \r\nproblem and obtain an improved understanding. We expect to make significant progresses \r\non both the theory, application and algorithmic aspects of the problem. As \r\na consequence, we would settle several open problems in the area, establishing \r\nnew links with other areas such as p-adic L-function, computational commutative \r\nalgebra, toric geometry and mirror symmetry. Due to the diversity and the scope \r\nof this proposal, the proposed research would involve several colloborators and \r\ngraduate students. It is hoped that the proposed research would also lead to \r\nseveral monographs or books which would make this beautiful subject coherent and \r\naccessible. \r\n",
