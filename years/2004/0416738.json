 "awd_abstract_narration": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae will be used for studies of the regulation of cell division. The specific aims of the research focus on Clb2, one of a group of cell cycle regulatory proteins known as cyclins.  Cyclin Cl2b is important for initiating mitosis, and previous work has shown that this protein localizes to multiple sites within the cell, including the nucleus, mitotic spindle, spindle pole bodies, bulk cytoplasm, and bud neck. This research aims to determine the contributions of these various populations of Clb2 to proper cell division. First, sequences within the Clb2 protein that are hypothesized to affect the partitioning of Cl2b between the nucleus and the cytoplasm will be investigated, and mutations in these sequences will be used to determine the effect of diminishing the cytoplasmic population of the protein. The possible role of the bud neck-localized population of Clb2 in regulating a known cell cycle signaling pathway will also be examined. To further address the function of cytoplasmic Clb2, a genetic screen will be performed to look for mutations that compromise the viability of yeast cells that already contain a mutation that affects Clb2 localization. Finally, a collection of yeast strains in which single genes have been deleted will be used to screen for genes that are important for localizing Clb2 to its various sites in the cell. The genes that are identified will then be analyzed for possible contributions to cell cycle regulation.  This project will provide research training for undergraduate students.",
