 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will answer the following question:  Is it feasible to build an efficient methodology and computer-based systems for content authoring and Web-based delivery that truly support multiple approaches to pedagogical practices?  Specifically, is it feasible to design an online authoring system and a complementary classroom management system, where the features and benefits of both systems are immediately available to innovative instructional designers?  The goal is to research an innovation that will empower content providers to use principled learning theories and associated pedagogical practices for creating new online curricula that support technology-mediated instruction. Specifically, the research will produce a new type of authoring and delivery system where the functionality available--creating course structure, managing multi-media content development, translating course specification into reliable production delivery, accessing course-related activities for students and their teachers, including dynamic learning interactions, and real-time behavior tracking and reporting--reflects the authors' preferred learning theories and pedagogies.\r\n\r\nAgile Mind proffers a set of enabling tools that support the development of technology-mediated instruction through cost-effective means for producing new curriculum, doing so with a focus on supporting instructional design innovation without compromising the capabilities of the technology.  The systems to be produced will address a major problem in education, i.e., the consolidation of content development and dissemination in the hands of a small number of publishing conglomerates and the resulting consequent lack of quality and diversity of choice.",
