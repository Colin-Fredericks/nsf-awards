 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project will produce high temperature titanium alloy lattice block materials (LBM) via casting. Lattice block materials are innovative periodic cellular materials that derive their outstanding mechanical performance from a structure of highly ordered internal triangles, rather than the properties of the parent material. To date, these engineered materials have been successfully cast for a number of ferrous and non-ferrous metals. For titanium alloys, only limited work has been done, mainly on compositions that are used at moderate temperature ranges. As higher temperature titanium alloys such as beta titanium are increasingly becoming the materials of choice for high temperature airframe and aero engine applications. Beta titanium alloys are extremely difficult to cast into complex and thin-walled shapes due to factors, including a propensity for forming shrinkage at the centerline of sections. Thus, a unique casting technology is being developed to make it possible to produce high temperature titanium alloy LBM. Potential applications include aircraft and spacecraft structures, including thermal protection systems, as well as aircraft and automotive engine components.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts derived from this technology would be Ti-LBM opportunities for weight and cost reduction for use in in future aerospace and non-aerospace systems. Ti-LBM can be used to replace more expensive honeycomb and sandwich structures built up from thin sheets/foils via hot forming, diffusion bonding, and superplastic forming. LBM made from high temperature Ti alloys would be capable of replacing lower temperature Ni-based superalloys for significant weight savings.\r\n",
