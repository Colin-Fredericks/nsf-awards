It will also provide participants with the\r\nopportunity to establish new collaborations and strengthen their\r\nexisting collaborations.\r\n\r\nIn addition to cutting-edge research presentations, this workshop will\r\nfeature discussion sessions, facilitated by experts, on the following\r\ntopics: Encouraging and retaining women and other underrepresented\r\ngroups in the number theory community; Applying for grants and funding\r\nopportunities.  Experts will contribute their own successful\r\nexperiences, aimed at engaging the participants in each of these\r\nimportant topics.  These discussion sessions will result in a written\r\nreport, to be posted on the American Institute for Mathematics (AIM)\r\nwebsite as a living document.  This will provide a lasting benefit to\r\nparticipants, as well as to their future students and colleagues.\r\n\r\n",
