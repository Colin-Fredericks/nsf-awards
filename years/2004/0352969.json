They plan to study the development of smaller, lighter and less costly LIDARs (Light Detecting and Ranging) systems.  LIDAR has been used in several areas such as space applications, earth science, target recognition and ranging.  Although the basic system level operating principles are similar to radar, LIDARs operate at much higher frequencies and can therefore produce much higher spatial resolution, and can track fast moving particles and objects with higher accuracy.  Because of these characteristics, LIDARs have a major advantage over radar technology in many applications such as pollution control, atmospheric science, and target recognition.  LIDAR is an active detection system that uses lasers as the coherent light source directed at the target for detection; however, there are spectrometric and spatial resolution issues in some applications.  Current LIDAR systems are based on very expensive technology that uses CO2 or Nd-YAG lasers, and have been used in many developed countries as a scientific and industrial tool.  Furthermore, these lasers are very large, lacking mobility, and are expensive. In this project the PIs will study the feasibility of using a low cost and low weight portable laser system, such as semiconductor solid state (diode and/or diode pumped) laser as the light source, a photodetector to detect the scattered light from the source, and off-the-shelf optical components to design a prototype LIDAR system.  Design, construction, and integration of this novel LIDAR system will be demonstrated.  During the integration stage, they will develop system control software and imaging software to acquire and analyze data. \r\n\r\nScope: The proposed research will foster a relationship between researchers in the US and in Turkey.  The two teams have complementary experiences.  The group in Turkey is well established in the field of remote sensing and the development of soft ware whereas the US group is more experienced with laser technology.  It is anticipated that this project will broaden the networks and partnerships among the participants. The results will have very broad applications in remote sensing, including the ability to detect structural damage due to earthquakes, a constant natural hazard in Turkey and in the United States.\r\n",
