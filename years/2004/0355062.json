 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ever since the discovery that elementary particles have spin, it has\r\nbeen clear that the strength of the interaction between these particles\r\ndepends on the relative orientation of these spins.  Until now, however,\r\nwith higher energy electromagnetic probes (photons) it has only been\r\npossible to study properties averaged over all possible spin\r\norientations.  Support for this proposal will allow the experimental\r\nnuclear physics group at The Catholic University of America to continue\r\nto develop and then exploit new systems which will permit the\r\nindependent orientation of both the photon and the target nucleus.  The\r\nresearch will address one of the major unsolved problems in hadronic\r\nstructure, the nature and number of excited states of the proton and\r\nneutron.  The spins of the individual quarks that make up the nucleon\r\ndetermine the properties of the excited states.  There are many\r\npredicted excited states but only a few have thus far been unambiguously\r\nidentified.  The question remains as to whether this is due to some\r\nadditional aspect of the theory not yet understood or due to\r\nexperimental problems in detecting these excited states.  Much of the\r\nexperimental difficulty lies in the broad and overlapping nature of\r\nthese excited state resonances.  It is only by performing measurements\r\nthat selectively excite only a few of these resonances at a time that\r\nthe properties of the individual states can be cleanly studied.  In the\r\nproposed studies we will use a newly commissioned polarized photon beam\r\nline and a new polarized target, along with a high-resolution,\r\nhigh-energy photon tagger to determine the photon energy, to initiate a\r\nnumber of detailed studies of these resonances.  Such measurements will\r\ncleanly discriminate between competing theoretical models and lead to a\r\nmuch better understanding of the nature of the fundamental forces\r\nbetween the quarks. \r\n\r\nThere are two areas where this research will have broader impact outside\r\nthe study of fundamental quark interactions.  The proposed research will\r\nprovide training for postdoctoral associates, graduate students pursing\r\nan advanced degree, and undergraduate physics and engineering students. \r\nThese training activities will cover a large range of experimental\r\nactivities including experience with cryogenics, high-speed electronics,\r\nparticle detectors, vacuum systems, and data processing. This training\r\nwill enhance the pool of scientifically and technically trained talent\r\navailable in this country.  Most of the research that will be conducted\r\nwithin this proposed program will involve the development of\r\ninstrumentation and experience with the use of energy-tagged polarized\r\nphoton beams.  These activities will lead to improvements which will be\r\nessential to the future experiments, including those at higher energy,\r\nnow being planned.\r\n",
