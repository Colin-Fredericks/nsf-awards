 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principal investigator and his colleagues study the\r\nstructure and function of real-world networked systems,\r\nparticularly information, computer, and social networks.  The\r\nwork includes an empirical component concerned with the discovery\r\nand analysis of network structure, including collaboration\r\nnetworks, citation networks of papers and of registered patents,\r\ntransportation and other geographic networks, social networks,\r\nand computer networks of various kinds including administrator\r\nand server-client networks and networks of \"weblogs.\"  Properties\r\nstudied include correlation functions, spatial structure,\r\ncentrality and similarity measures, and measures of assortative\r\nmixing and community structure.  There is also a theoretical\r\ncomponent to the work, involving the development of models to aid\r\nin the understanding of the effects of network structure.  Of\r\nparticular interest are generalized random graph models of\r\nnetworks, percolation models of network resilience, growth\r\nmodels, exponential random graphs, and Markov graphs.  The\r\nproject also includes the development of new computer algorithms\r\nfor extracting and visualizing network structure, particularly\r\nfor the detection of community structure in networks.\r\n\r\n     The investigator and colleagues try to understand the form\r\nand behavior of networks, particularly information networks,\r\ncomputer networks, and social networks. The work has bearing on a\r\nnumber of issues of current importance.  A knowledge of the\r\nstructure of networks of acquaintance is crucial to an\r\nunderstanding of how information, such as news, rumors, consumer\r\ntrends, etc., spreads through society.  Similarly, networks of\r\nphysical contact between people govern the way in which diseases\r\nspread and computer networks govern the spread of computer\r\nviruses.  A proper understanding of the nature and progress of\r\ninfections is impossible without good network models.  The work\r\ndescribed here is aimed both at determining what the structure of\r\nthe networks in question is, and also at modeling the effect of\r\nthat structure on possible outcomes.  As well as enhancing basic\r\nunderstanding of these problems, the results point to ways in\r\nwhich network structure or dynamics can be changed in order to\r\neither improve network transmission (in the case of information)\r\nor slow it down (in the case of epidemics).  For disease\r\ntransmission, for instance, it may be possible to suggest\r\neffective targets for immunization or education campaigns to slow\r\ndisease spread.  New data resources and analysis techniques also\r\nare developed that will aid future work by other researchers on\r\nrelated topics.\r\n",
