 "awd_abstract_narration": "What does it mean to be fully educated . especially in the sciences, engineering, and technology\r\n-- in our pluralistic 21st century society? To explore this question, Syracuse University proposes\r\nhosting a workshop, using the intergroup-dialogue model (IGD), to draw together select leaders\r\nfrom prominent research universities, corporations, government and non- profit organizations.\r\nThe inaugural workshop will take place at Syracuse University in spring, 2005, with the\r\npossibility of one or more workshops to follow subsequently. We will extend invitations to\r\ntwenty university participants, including institutional presidents, provosts and eminent scholars.\r\nCentrally important to this intergroup-dialogue approach will be inclusion of contrasting -- and\r\nperhaps conflicting -- perspectives within research universities (e.g., public, private and\r\ntechnological institutions; geographically dispersed; with and without medical schools). The\r\nindividual scholars from sciences and engineering selected for this workshop will have\r\nevidenced both deep knowledge of specific domains and considerable breadth across field\r\nboundaries. We will also invite select leaders from major corporations, government agencies,\r\nand non-profit entities (e.g., FASEB, AAAS, NAE, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and\r\nBurroughs Wellcome Fund, and NACME). The National Science Foundation will play a key\r\nrole in these workshops. \r\nUse of the intergroup model applied to our core question . what does it mean to be a fully\r\neducated member of the 21st century workforce . will impact both higher education and society\r\nthrough the following project objectives: (1) create a forum for diverse stakeholders to engage in\r\nintergroup dialogue addressing the question .what does it mean to be a fully educated member of\r\nthe 21st century Workforce?. (2) develop recommendations and possible strategies for higher\r\neducation, government agencies, and other key stakeholders to use to achieve this goal; and (3)\r\nassess the effectiveness of the intergroup dialogue model in a new application.\r\nThe dissemination plan for this workshop will include distribution of the written\r\nrecommendations and the video recordings from the sessions through the Syracuse University\r\nweb site.",
