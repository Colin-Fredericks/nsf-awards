The Site supports twelve undergraduates every year for a 10-week summer research experience. This is an interdisciplinary research program that recruits students in their sophomore and junior years majoring in Chemical Engineering, Materials Science, Chemistry and Ceramics. The program brings together faculty from diverse scientific backgrounds along with staff scientists from Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories. The emphasis is on fundamental research that has potential impact on industrial applications. Research projects are grouped into three trust areas: Microsystems and Nano-Bio Interfaces, Nanostructured Materials, and Synthesis of Engineered Materials Via Self Assembly. Students also participate in ethics seminars, and in field trips to Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories and to local industries.\r\n\r\nThe REU Site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\n",
