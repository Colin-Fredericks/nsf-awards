 "awd_abstract_narration": "To make STEM education available to the Yup.ik residents of the Y-K Delta, we propose to do the \r\nfollowing to establish an academic program that effectively trains Alaskan Natives for STEM \r\ncareers and bridges these students to the main campuses in Alaska: \r\n- A suite of proven models will be utilized. These models include (1) the Treisman model for \r\neffective methods of teaching mathematics, (2) the ANSEP model for recruitment,retention \r\nand matriculation, (3) the ESP (Emerging Scholars Program) model for retention and \r\nguidance, and  (4) the TRIO model for recruitment and intensive course delivery. \r\n- The models will be modified and combined to most effectively serve the Yup.ik students in the \r\nY-K Delta. For instance, elements of the Treisman model and the ANSEP model will be \r\ndirected at recruiting and training non-traditional and under-prepared students as well as \r\nYup.ik students with strong academic records. This program will broaden the scope of \r\nrecruitment and retention beyond what has previously been done in other programs. \r\n- An integrated program of new course offerings in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology \r\nand information technology will be developed at KuC. This suite of courses will give students \r\noptions in the programs they enter at KuC, will enable students to receive two years of STEM \r\neducation at KuC before matriculating to the four-year campuses at Fairbanks and \r\nAnchorage, and will allow them to locally receive professional certifications and associate \r\ndegrees with emphasis in STEM areas. \r\n- using modified forms of the TRIO/Talent Search and the ANSEP models, both non-traditional \r\nand high school students will be recruited. Summer intensive camps will be offered to involve \r\nstudents in science, technology and mathematics. One-month intensive courses in \r\nmathematics, science and computer technology will be offered in order to give prospective \r\ncollege students stronger backgrounds in these areas before enrolling in college. Students \r\nwill also participate in TALPA, where they design and build their own computer. The purpose \r\nof these summer intensives is to create interest in and excitement about STEM careers. \r\n- The summer intensives are followed by distance-delivered videoconference courses to high \r\nschool students to keep them involved in the program and to continue their STEM training. A \r\nnumber of distance-delivered courses in ITS will also be used for this purpose.  \r\n- In conjunction with the summer intensives and recruitment activities, the ESP and ANSEP \r\nfaculty will engage in a proactive advising and guidance effort to involve the students in \r\ncollege activities, build cohort groups, a strong sense of community among the students, and \r\nimproved student self image. The advising center and STEM faculty will likewise maintain \r\ncontact with high school students. \r\n- Upon enrolling in KuC, students continue to receive advising, guidance and rigorous STEM \r\ntraining, and they continue to work within their cohort groups. Bridging will be accomplished \r\nwhen they matriculate to the four-year campuses.",
