 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Professors Mauricio J. Mixco and Marianna Di Paolo will head four teams in transcribing and translating materials from the Wick R. Miller Collection (WRMC) at the University of Utah. The teams, which include Shoshoni native-speakers, will will preserve and enhance the accessibility of the 148 tape recordings and associated manuscripts in Great Basin languages now vulnerable to deterioration, including 119 untranscribed and untranslated tapes in the Shoshoni/Gosiute language, a member of the Central Numic branch of Numic, a the Uto-Aztecan language family spoken in the Great Basin regions of Nevada, Utah, Idaho and Wyoming. With roughly 2,000 to 3,000 native speakers, Shoshoni/Gosiute is \r\nhighly endangered as most speakers are above 60 years old and it is \r\nnot being passed on to the youngest generations.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the recordings and manuscripts at risk contain invaluable \r\nlinguistic, cultural, and historical data collected over 30 years by \r\nthe late Numic expert, Wick R. Miller, primarily by and about the \r\nGreat Basin Shoshoni and Gosiute tribes, whose cultural heritage is \r\ncontained in Miller's recordings and manuscripts. The original tape \r\nrecordings will be re-mastered onto archival quality reel-to-reel \r\ntapes and DAT tapes to serve as digital masters from which to produce \r\nworking files for transcription and downloading to more portable \r\ncompact disk or cassette formats. Linguistics student assistants \r\nwill scan and/or type into a computer database the Miller notebooks \r\nand binders containing field notes from elicitation sessions along \r\nwith the few existing transcripts of the tapes. This will produce a \r\nsearchable electronic copy of the notebooks and binders. Tribal \r\nmembers and scholars will have ready access to the materials through \r\nthe University of Utah Marriott Library and on a website, especially \r\nin support of current and future language maintenance and \r\nrevitalization efforts.\r\n\r\nA projected reference grammar, dictionary and text collection will \r\nalso draw on previous studies of Shoshoni/Gosiute sentence structure, \r\nsupplementing these materials with original analyses of its syntax \r\nand semantics to fill in gaps in the earlier research. The proposed \r\nreference grammar will cover the structure, meaning, and use of all \r\nknown Shoshoni/Gosiute simple and complex sentence types and other \r\ndiscourse structures. Entries in the grammar and bilingual \r\nShoshoni-English dictionary will be streamlined, with generalizations \r\nstated early and with complications and exceptions added later.  A \r\nwide range of examples and additional cultural notes that can be \r\nignored by readers seeking a quick overview will be included. The reference grammar, dictionary and text collection will aid community efforts to strengthen the use of Shoshoni/Gosiute and maintain its rich linguistic and literary tradition. They will also be a resource for linguists to test analyses of grammatical phenomena and to further describe how Shoshoni/Gosiute fits into the spectrum of human languages.\r\n",
