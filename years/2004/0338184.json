Smith (PI), co-PI's: Mikle Ellis, Richard Wabrek, Richard Inouye \r\nNumber of Fellows per Year: 10 Graduate, 5 advanced undergraduate \r\nSchool District Partners:  Idaho School Districts #25, 91, 93, and 512. \r\nTarget Audience of the Project:  Grades 5-12. \r\nSetting:  urban and rural \r\nNSF Supported Disciplines Involved:  Biological Sciences, Engineering, Technology, Geosciences, Chemistry, and Physical Sciences \r\n\r\nNarrative Summary: This Track 1 project, based in southeastern Idaho, is a partnership between Idaho State University (ISU), school districts in the region's two major cities (Pocatello and Idaho Falls), and two non-profit organizations (a zoo and museum).  Two major employers in the area are also participating in the project, with both technical and monetary assistance. The project has a theme of using relevant, local topics in science, engineering and technology to enhance student interest and performance in the target disciplines. The project is designed to enhance: 1) the ability of scientists and engineers to teach and communicate scientific topics to the public, 2) science and engineering instruction in Idaho schools, and 3) partnerships between ISU, local school districts, informal education venues such as the museum and zoo, and local industry. Project activities include an intensive week-long summer workshop to build strong teacher- scientist partnerships, provide professional development for K-12 teachers, and give Fellows the pedagogical training and the opportunity to work with teachers to develop specific problem- or inquiry-based lessons in keeping with state/national standards. Fellows are selected from: Engineering, Technology, Biology, Chemistry, and Geology. University faculty mentor Fellows with required monthly faculty/fellow/ teacher meetings. An extensive evaluation process measures project outcomes, from impacts on K-12 students, to assessments of Fellow's enhanced communication skills. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The project explores the effects of implementing a model scientist-teacher-student partnership in a community transitioning from a traditionally agricultural economy towards a high-tech economy. Activities of Fellows are hypothesized to increase student engagement and performance in STEM, and to improve scientific communication. The theme-based approach, stressing topics of local relevance, was conceived by K-12 teachers and the PIs. This approach incorporates the national science standards for inquiry-based learning, and addresses self-identified needs of the schools, and industries, by incorporating scientists into classroom activities. Fellows and teachers are supported and mentored by ISU faculty, and scientists and engineers in local industries and organizations. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The project will produce more scientifically literate K-12 students who will be attracted to STEM disciplines and careers. The project will increase the participation of Native American students in STEM (because of the population of the partner schools), provide K-12 teachers with science teaching resources, improve the communication of scientific research results and methods, and strengthen ISU's partnerships with the schools. This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n",
