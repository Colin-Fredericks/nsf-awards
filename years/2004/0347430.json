 "awd_abstract_narration": "Micro-air-vehicles (MAVs) are bird-sized platforms designed to fly in near-Earth environments like forests, buildings, tunnels and caves where often GPS, lighting and communication are poor and the flight spaces are cluttered.  The fundamental gap in the knowledge base that prevents MAVs from becoming autonomous is the lack of flight data and sensor metrics.  Without such data, designing sensor suites remains ad hoc and hapchance.  Proposed is work that combines fundamental analytical, computational and experimental research towards the design, validation and flight-testing of sensor suites for MAVs.  A novel lab-based test rig is designed to collect data and performance metrics under a wide range of gust and lighting levels in a controlled and repeatable manner. The rig serves as a tool to also test whether sensor designs and navigation principles that biomimic flying insects can reliably be applied to MAVs.  Industrial and government lab collaborations buttress this proposal.  Unique K-20 educational components complement this proposal and are capstoned by the first-ever indoor flying robot contest to coincide with the Wright Brothers Centennial.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMicro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are bird-sized flying robots.  Their size permits them to fly in and around buildings, down caves and tunnels, or through forests.  Such near-Earth environments are often filled with features and clutter like poles, fixtures, and trees.   In order for MAVs to autonomously fly in such areas, they must be able to avoid collisions.  Such capabilities demand the sensors and algorithms to respectively detect and circumvent obstacles.  The conventional practice often begins by retrofitting an existing aircraft with collision avoidance suites and then flight tests.  Such practice is ad hoc and often is vicious build-fly-crash cycle that time-consuming, costly and risky.\n\nThe project\u00c6s general objective is the design of autonomous MAVs capable of flying in near-Earth environments.  This is important because such robots can increase situation awareness in missions like disaster mitigation and search-and-rescue; the MAV\u00c6s on-board camera could help in tasks like finding casualties and assess building damage.  The specific objective is to analytically design such MAVs.  The conviction is that MAV design is holistic where the sensor suite is tightly coupled to the aircraft\u00c6s dynamics.  For example, to avoid obstacles like telephone wires, sensing and path planning must account for the aircraft\u00c6s speed and maneuverability.  If the aircraft flies too slowly or too aggressively (i.e. high angle-of-attack) the vehicle can lose lift and crash.  Other technical design requirements include attention to sensor footprint.  MAVs have limited payload and computational power.  Furthermore, near-Earth environments typically deny GPS and degrade wireless communications.  Lastly, sensor suites should work despite varied illumination, adverse weather (including gust), and obscurants (e.g. smoke or fog).\n\nThe technical approach centers on the construction of a Systems Integrated Sensor Test Rig.  Called SISTR, this infrastructure is a Cartesian XYZ gantry with a roll-pitch-yaw end-effector.  In other words, the end-effector can emulate an aircraft\u00c6s six degrees-of-freedom motion.  SISTR\u00c6s workspace is akin to a theatre set.  Mockups of near-Earth environments like building facades and forests can be constructed and hosted in the workspace.  Lighting, fans and generators (like fog machines) surrounding the gantry allow one to control illumination, gust and obscurants.  Lastly, a high-fidelity math model of the MAV\u00c6s dynamics is hosted on a computer and a mockup of the MAV is mounted on the gantry\u00c6s end-effector.  Sensor data feeds into the math model and path planning algorithms actuate gantry motions. \n\nThis project has intellectual merit because SISTR results in a hardware-in-the-loop tool to analytically design and test-and-evaluate MAVs.  SISTR\u00c6s lighting, fans and obscurants are controllable and thus provide repeatable and consistent testing so that sensors can be accurately characterized, navigational algorithms can be tuned, and MAV fabrication can be perfected.  This project has broader impact because SISTR will reduce the time, cost and risk of designing MAVs and hence more effective than the current ad hoc build-fly-crash design cycle.  MAVs that can autonomously fly in near-Earth environments can also broadly impact first response and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) manufacturers and stakeholders.\n\nOutcomes over the project\u00c6s lifetime include the design and delivery of new classes of MAVs, over 40 presentations to the public, over 2-dozen academic publications, 3 doctoral dissertations, and public online tutorials on MAV design.  One vehicle was a fixed-wing MAV capable of hovering like a helicopter and its design was demonstrated and delivered to the Special Forces for surveilling large areas and periodically hovering into and around caves.  Presentations at Capitol Hill and the National Science Board showcased MAVs for disaster response.  Online tutorials helped to train students and facilitate involvement in an ann..."
