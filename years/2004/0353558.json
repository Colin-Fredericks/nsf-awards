 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Baylor REU program offers research opportunities in a wide range of physics topics. Selected student Fellows reside on-site for approximately ten weeks with two-week extensions available for those requesting them. Fellows are selected using a national application process with the program advertised at universities around the nation, smaller undergraduate and technical institutions with little or no research capability and historically minority institutions. Complete application information, research information and the ability to apply to the program on-line is provided through a dedicated REU web page. Participating Fellows choose from theoretical or experimental research opportunities in astrophysics, dusty plasmas, elementary particle physics, nuclear physics, space physics or surface physics. All REU Fellows are required to give an end of summer presentation. Additionally, they are strongly encouraged to present their results at international conferences and invited to publish their results (when possible) in peer-reviewed journals. The program provides funding both for student participation at such conferences and the associated publication costs.  Research opportunities are also available for in-service teachers through the RET component of the program.\r\n",
