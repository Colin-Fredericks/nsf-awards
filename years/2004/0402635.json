 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is comprehensively integrating cybersecurity concepts into the curriculum of the Computer Information Systems (CIS) Department at Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC).  In addition, the project is offering an eight-week summer instructional program (a \"bridge\" program) for high school students; arranging internships for students in conjunction with industry partners; developing a cybersecurity laboratory; and providing professional development for college and high school faculty through in-person and online workshops and training sessions.\r\n\r\nThe project team is creating four courses and redesigning seventeen other courses in order to integrate computer security concepts into each major (Computer Operations, Computer Programming, and Computer Science) in the college's CIS curriculum.  The computer security concepts included in these courses are derived from objectives specified by CompTIA's Security+ certification and the Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) specified by the International Information Systems Security Certifications Consortium [(ISC)2] for the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) and System Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP) certifications.  The concepts covered in the courses are also tied to job competencies defined in the computer security skill standards that have been developed by the National Workforce Center for Emerging Technologies (NWCET).  In addition to redesigning the curricula for CIS majors, the project team is redesigning a non-major CIS course to raise the cybersecurity awareness of students in non-technical majors.\r\n\r\nBy infusing cybersecurity concepts throughout the subject matter of existing curricula, this project takes a different approach than traditional security instruction, which presupposes a certain body of knowledge prior to introducing security concepts to students.  This different approach extends the impact of this project by enabling students with diverse academic backgrounds to engage in different activities within the context of computer security.  At one end of the spectrum, it encourages computer science majors to do research on the underlying theories of security, while at the other end, it raises awareness and teaches secure computing practices to non-CIS majors.  The project also includes high school students recruited through a summer \"bridge\" program, and enables graduates to continue their education through articulation agreements with four-year colleges.\r\n\r\nThe project is also attracting minorities and women into information technology careers.  Over 75% of BMCC's students are African American or Hispanic, and over two thirds of BMCC's students are women.  The college has developed a \"collaborative learning model\" that has proven particularly effective in engaging and retaining female and minority students in science, technology, and mathematics fields.\r\n\r\nBMCC's partners in the project include Louis D. Brandeis High School, Herbert H. Lehman College, Alcatel Corp., the New York Software Industry Association, the U.S. Secret Service Electronic Crimes Branch, and the New York City Regional Consortium.\r\n",
