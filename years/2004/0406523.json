The International Symposium on Avian Endocrinology (ISAE) has been held approximately every four years since 1977. The objective of the conference is to provide a review of the field of avian endocrinology and to bring scientists from multiple sub-disciplines together for information exchange and the development of collaborations. The 8th ISAE will be held in June, \r\n2004 in Scottsdale, Arizona and will be hosted by Arizona State University. This is only the second time the meeting has been held in the United States and the first time in 20 years. As such, it provides a golden opportunity to engage US students and recent graduates with colleagues from across the globe. Information will be exchanged in plenary lectures, invited symposium talks, poster sessions and informally during meals, social events and the mid-\r\nconference day of arranged field trips. Participants from more than 20 countries are expected. Based on conferences, the Symposium will foster the exchange of new information and facilitate many cooperative, international projects and will create opportunities for promising young students and postdoctoral researchers to participate fully in this international conference. It will also provide US  students and postdocs with the opportunity to interact and form collaborations with each other and with researchers from across the globe.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
