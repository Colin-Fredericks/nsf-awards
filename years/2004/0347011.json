BALARAS\r\nINSTITUTION:\t\t\tUNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nCAREER:  LARGE-EDDY SIMULATIONS OF TURBULENT FLOWS WITH DYNAMICALLY MOVING BOUNDARIES\r\n\r\nThe research is focused on improving understanding of turbulent and transitional flows in biofluids applications.  High fidelity methods to model turbulence and transition such a Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) and Large-Eddy Simulations (LES), have contributed invaluable information on the structure and dynamics of a variety of engineering flows.  However, such methods have received considerably less attention for applications in biology and physiology due in part to exceedingly complex (moving) boundary conditions.  A characteristic example is that of blood flow in the heart and large arteries.  New computational tools will have many important applications in cardiovascular medicine, including such topics as disease research, surgical planning and medical/biomemetic device design. Recent advances in material technologies and actuator miniaturization has sparked new interest in biomemetics.  Broad impacts of the work include significant societal and outreach components.  By developing the proposed computational methodology, a large number of problems can be solved leading to the advancement of knowledge across several fields in engineering.  Specifically computations of the flow around prosthetic heart valves will provide an accurate description of the detailed flow physics and provide a solid basis for multiscale simulations designed to illuminate the mechanics of blood damage and thrombus formation.  Such information will assist the biomedical community in interpreting physiological data and designing novel experiments.  Fish swimming, insect locomotion and bird flight are further examples where massive computations using DNS/LES can help bring to fruition novel devices (such a Micro-Aero Vehicles) and contribute a new fundamental understanding to the science of their locomotion.  The PI is participating in high school outreach via the ESTEEM mentorship program (Engineering Science and Technology to Energize and Expand Young Minds).  He also plans to involve undergraduates in research via the GEMSTONE program at the University of Maryland, which is for honors students and integrates technological and societal issues into research projects undertaken throughout an entire 4-year program.\r\n\r\n",
