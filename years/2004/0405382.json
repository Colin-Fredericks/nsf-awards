 "awd_abstract_narration": "This  Small  Grant  for Exploratory Research  (SGER)  will investigated techniques for accommodating vision impaired in chemical engineering majors.  The objectives of the study are \r\n \r\n1.   To understand how team based, challenge learning occurs when a vision impaired \r\n      student is included in a group. \r\n2.  To determine in what manner a visually impaired student contributes to the \r\n      overall design process and the developing communication skills within the team. \r\n \r\nStudents will accomplish the tasks typical of a chemical engineering design course (debottlenecking and grass roots design). \r\n \r\nThe project will yield insights into the process by which a vision atypical student functions within a design team on open ended problems.  \r\n\r\nSoftware adaptations, communication media, and knowledge gained will be broadly disseminated  to  engineering  faculty.    The PI will also demonstrate how three outcomes deemed necessary by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) are  achieved  with  atypical  vision  students,  namely  function  in  multidisciplinary  teams develop and use effective written and oral communication skills and use the techniques, skills and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.  This study will also encourage other atypical students to consider an engineering education.  \r\n\r\n",
