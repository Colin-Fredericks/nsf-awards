 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) Hawaii Pacific University is in the initial stages of reform of the algebra-based physics course.  During the first year of reform, algebra-based physics has been converted from separate lab and lecture classes to a studio format, with lab and lecture integrated into one course.  Modeling Instruction, as described by Hestenes (see for example, Am. J. Phys. 55(5), \r\n440-454, (1987)), applies a studio-based approach to a model-centered curriculum where the focus is on the process of building and using models. Introduction of Modeling Instruction in the algebra-based curriculum is an on-going effort. Accordingly, this project is supporting adaptation of studio physics and Modeling Instruction with the assistance of the technological capabilities of the physics department. \r\n\r\nIn this project existing university modeling curricula, which is written for calculus-based physics, is being adapted to algebra-based physics and to the particular needs of students at Hawaii Pacific University.  This project includes funds for technological and curricular development and is providing compelling data about the differences between low-tech and high-tech studio physics classes. These data are useful to physics instructors considering the development of high-tech classrooms.  The project is also providing evidence of the applicability of modeling instruction to algebra-based physics classes.  Often, algebra-based physics affects a greater number of students than the calculus-based course; this effort extends benefits of modeling instruction to a greater number of students.  Finally, this combination of Studio-based instruction with the Modeling curriculum provides a template for developing algebra-based instruction.",
