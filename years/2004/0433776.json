 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal to NSF CPA Cluster for Supporting Student Travel to the 2nd ACM/IEEE \r\nInternational Conference on Methods & Models for Co-Design (MEMOCODE.04) \r\n \r\n\r\nAs computing systems  are becoming increasingly  complex, integrated to daily usable \r\nartifacts such as cell phones, cars, hand-held devices, medical prosthetics and other wide \r\nrange of applications, the need for design methodologies which can guarantee successful \r\nintegration  of  hardware  and  software,  functional  correctness  and  reliability  is  gaining \r\nimportance. Today.s computing is no longer limited to servers, work stations and desktop \r\ncomputing, but they are embedded everywhere, most importantly in the medical space, as \r\nwell as in the safety critical systems such as avionics control, automotive control etc. \r\nHowever, historically hardware and software have been built separately, and both being \r\nextremely complex, the methodologies that ensure correct construction of hardware or \r\nsoftware are themselves research topics. Yet, we are faced with the need for formal and \r\nmathematical techniques to model and analyze systems which integrate  both hardware \r\nand software, because of the increasing  reliance of human society on ubiquitous and \r\npervasive computing. \r\n \r\nIn 2003 the First  International ACM/IEEE Formal Methods and Models for Co-Design \r\n(MEMOCODE)  conference,  for  the  first  time,  brought  together  researchers  who  apply \r\nformal methods in software engineering fields, and those who apply formal methods to \r\ndesign  and validate hardware systems.  It was felt from the panel discussions, key  note \r\ntalks, and informal discussions that formal method practitioners from both sides have a \r\nlot of share in terms of knowledge, experience and techniques. Also, the hardware-\r\nsoftware co-design problem imposes an ever than before need for this symbiosis, which \r\nwas  the  original  aims of  creating  this  series  of  conferences.  More  importantly,  the US \r\nresearchers present at the conference last  year (in France), felt that there is a lack of \r\nresearch activity in this important area of formal methods in the US, compared to the \r\ninitiatives and research activities in Europe. As a result, this year the conference is being \r\nheld in San Diego, California, to bring more US participants, and create a forum for US \r\nresearchers  to  exchange  formal method  ideas,  techniques  and  creative  initiatives.    This \r\nproposal seeks financial support from NSF to support US graduate or advanced \r\nundergraduate students attending the conference for the first time, so that they  get \r\nexposure to various aspects of formal methods, and recognize the importance of formal \r\nmethods in system design,  especially  hardware/software safety  critical systems.  The \r\nintellectual impact of this support from NSF would be that the increased attendance of \r\nbright  young  students  will  fuel  more  research  work  in  this  very  important  area.  The \r\nEuropean community has made much more progress than their counter parts in the US \r\ndue to a much less degree of interest by researchers to pursue formal methods. NSF can \r\nmake substantial contribution to the enrichment of educational and research objectives of \r\nMEMOCODE. The workshop has some funding from sources other than NSF for invited \r\nspeakers and other expenses.  Broader Impact  of the requested NSF funding is that it \r\nwill  provide  travel  support  for  students  of  US  researchers,  to  encourage  education  and \r\nresearch in the workshop topic.  The emphasis  will be on funding students who do not \r\notherwise have funding sources to attend the conference, and an attempt will be made to \r\nfund members of underrepresented groups.",
