 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ten Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) students will spend the summer at Michigan Technological University examining Ecosystems in Transition.  The students will work with faculty mentors on existing large-scale, long-term, interdisciplinary experiments examining the responses of forest ecosystems to climatic variations, anthropogenic pollutants, changing wildlife populations, exotic species invasions and ecosystem restoration efforts.  During the ten-week program, each student will also develop and carry out an independent research project examining a specific aspect of an important environmental issue.  During the second half of the program, many of the students will spend periods of time off-campus at field research locations.  \r\nIn addition to their research, the REU students will participate in educational training sessions on the experimental design, communicating science to professional and lay audiences, and ethics in science.  Through a series of Case Study discussion, they also will examine the role that basic research plays in improving our understanding of ecosystem function and the development of environmental policy.  At the end of the ten-week session, the students will present their research findings at a symposium sponsored by MTU.  The work of all REU students will be published by MTU, and students will be encouraged to submit their results to peer-reviewed journals.  The REU students they will be able to explore career possibilities through meetings with invited speakers from universities, government agencies and private industry, attendance at a national scientific meeting, and a career workshop.  The program is open to all undergraduate students, and stipends, room, board and travel are provided.  Women and students from underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply.  For more information, students should contact Dr. Andrew Burton (ajburton@mtu.edu or (906) 487-2566), or visit http://www.forest.mtu.edu/reu/.\r\n",
