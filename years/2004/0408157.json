 "awd_abstract_narration": "When plants discards their leaves the resulting litter decomposes in the soil litter layer. Because different decomposition rates can change the amount of organic matter that is stored in the soil as well as the speed of nutrient cycling, understanding the controls on decomposition rate is an important goal. One important factor affecting decomposition is the physical and chemical traits of the leaves. In different environmental conditions plants (both within a species and between different species) have different leaf physical \r\nand chemical characteristics. That is, some leaves are thick and nutrient-poor while others are thin and nutrient-rich, and these different leaf types are often matched to the environment in a way  that is advantageous to the plant. This project seeks to connect the leaf characteristics found in certain environmental conditions to the  decomposability of different leaf litters. Specifically, it will test the effect of leaf traits found on fertile and infertile soils at  both high and low precipitation. The effects of leaf traits on decomposition will be studied in two systems-in Hawaii within a species, and in Australia across species. The resulting data will allow a new test for the interactive effects of precipitation  and soil nutrients on the decomposability of leaf litter.\r\n",
