 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award provides funds for the acquisition of two systems: (i) photolithographic equipment for front- and back-side mask alignment, and (ii) Low Pressure Chemical-Vapor Deposition stack for thin film formation. The mask alignment and exposure system is used to align fabricated features in thin films sequentially formed either on the front side or the back side of a substrate to realize a complete microdevice. This is the process that allows the manufacturing of devices such as sensors and actuators, as well as integrated circuits, about a few micrometers in lateral dimensions. The deposition stack is used to for the deposition of thin films such as polycrystalline silicon, low-stress silicon nitride, low-temperature silicon dioxide and phosphosilicate glass. These are the most commonly used silicon-based thin films in MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) technology. This equipment will be used by both students and researchers to fabricate and characterize complete microsystems integrating electrical (transistors), mechanical (beams), optical (wave-guides), thermal (heaters), biological (proteins) and chemical components on a single chip.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of these systems is an essential component of the long-term plan of the University of Arizona to set-up a state-of-the-art micro/nano fabrication facility in support of its interdisciplinary teaching and research programs. The on-campus facility will allow researchers from various academic disciplines such as science, engineering and medicine to develop novel microdevices requiring selectively modified and photolithographically defined surface properties leading, particularly, to a unique synergy in the field of nano-bio-micro systems. The facility will support the education of under-graduate and graduate students in the areas of semiconductor processing, device manufacturing, micromachining, and nano science and technology. In the fast evolving technological scene, it is imperative to train the new generation of engineers and researchers with the most advanced equipment and techniques. Moreover, the facility will make a significant impact on product development being conducted by a large number of high-tech companies in the Southwest utilizing advanced semiconductor processing.",
