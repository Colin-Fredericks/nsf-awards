 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposer will continue his study of the longstanding Kadison--Ringrose\r\nconjecture on the cohomology of von Neumann algebras. He will use and \r\nrefine some recently developed techniques needed to show the complete \r\nboundedness of certain multilinear operators. Investigations of the cohomology\r\ngroups have led naturally to the recently introduced concept of norming \r\nsubalgebras, and this topic will be pursued since it applies directly to \r\nboth cohomology and the bounded projection problem. In a different, but \r\nrelated, direction, maximal abelian subalgebras (masas) and general \r\nsubalgebras of von Neumann algebras will be studied. In joint work, the \r\nproposer has introduced the concept of strongly singular masas, and has \r\nshown that many finite factors arising from hyperbolic groups (a class \r\nwhich includes the free groups) have such masas. The results so far \r\nobtained indicate that the theory can now expand to study general \r\nsubalgebras. This relates directly to the structure of factors (the \r\nbuilding blocks of operator algebras), and the overall goal of these \r\nproposed areas of research is to increase our understanding in this area. \r\nBuilding on previously accomplished work, problems in the theory of \r\ntopological entropy for automorphisms will be studied. Automorphisms are \r\nthe most basic objects associated to operator algebras, and they can \r\nreveal different facets of the same underlying object. The entropy is a \r\nnumerical constant that distinguishes different automorphisms.\r\nPrevious joint work of the proposer showed that the current theory, based \r\non completely positive maps, can be better reformulated in terms of \r\ncomplete contractions. This puts the theory into a much more flexible \r\nsituation where more general and powerful tools can be brought to bear on the \r\nproblems of the field, notably relating to crossed products by \r\nautomorphism groups.\r\n                                                                                \r\n  The modern study of operator algebras has evolved from two main sources. \r\nMatrices, which are generalizations of numbers, were introduced to solve \r\nequations and now find applications from computer graphics to search \r\nengines for the web. In formulating quantum mechanics mathematically, von \r\nNeumann found that he needed infinite dimensional versions of matrices \r\ncalled linear operators which were best studied in operator algebras. \r\nMoreover the time evolution of quantum mechanical systems came to be \r\nexpressed in terms of the crossed product by groups of automorphisms, and \r\nhere topological entropy plays an important role. The project is mainly \r\nconcerned with the theoretical underpinnings of operator algebras, but \r\nthe proposed work in these areas could impact some of these more concrete \r\nareas, since the finite factors are those operator algebras which most \r\nclosely model matrices.\r\n",
