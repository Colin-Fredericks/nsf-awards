 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER grant combines research and educational initiatives in the area of developing a systematic approach to materials processing, specifically, a systems approach for dealing with atomic scale dynamics.\r\n\r\nResearch:\r\n\r\nThe research program focuses on materials processing that occurs at a surface, through deposition or removal of material.  The specific research goals are: (1) develop a multiscale interface model that is informed by atomic scale models; (2) design an estimation and control strategy that interprets limited sensor data using atomic scale models; and (3) demonstrate a systems approach to materials processing in experiments, with metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of yttria-stabilized zirconia, using emissivity-correcting pyrometry.  The research program will demonstrate a systems approach to surface processing that should be applicable to a wide range of materials and processes, enabling process design for new materials with optimized properties, as well as improvements in manufacturing repeatability and efficiency.  Beyond materials processing the PI plans to demonstrate a methodology for engineering complex atomic scale systems, from quantum computation to metabolic engineering.\r\n\r\nBroad Impact:\r\n\r\nComplementing the research plan is the PI's commitment to demonstrating the importance of mathematics in everyday life to high school students.  She is developing course modules for Marietta High School.  She is also working on a college-level course titled \"Emerging Applications of Control\" to educate college students in the broad applicability of control concepts and their relevance in the sciences.\r\n",
