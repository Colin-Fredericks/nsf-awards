 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I aims to extend an interactive anatomy-learning environment from undergraduate into middle school and high school settings.  Life sciences education in middle and high school is severely limited because of the cost and complexity of authentic laboratory experiences.  This project will provide easy access to powerful data sources with tools for manipulating the data for a learning objective.  This environment marks a unique approach to the application of computer technology to the K-12 anatomy and physiology curriculum, specifically grades 7-12, but with applicability to K-6.  The environment supports an interactive work model where students engage in the same cycle of observation, interpretation, and action that characterized the historic \"dissect and sketch paradigm.\"  This environment allows students to produce an individual and unique visual record of their investigations, while they learn sophisticated computer skills, problem-solving techniques, and health science content.\r\n     The tools resulting from this research will greatly enhance the ability of middle and high school teachers and students to access federally funded anatomical data such as the National Library of Medicine's Visible Human data sets, needed to learn basic anatomy.  Providing this experience virtually improves overall access, and providing it early in a child's learning program might increase the number and quality of health care professionals in the future..\r\n",
