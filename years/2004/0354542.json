Joseph, University of Minnesota\r\n\r\nThis proposal is to do exploratory study of the effects of nanoparticle dispersed in polymeric solutions. We will be looking at the enhancements in pulling power in tubeless siphons due to the nanoparticles. The effect is evidently to create a new material wherein the polymer molecule is replaced by an effective (super) polymer molecule bridged by nanoparticles. We want to explore the effects of the size of small particles on the enhancements of the siphon. We propose also to explore effects of carbon nanotubes on\r\nrheological properties of polymer solutions. The tests of these enhancements on properties will be done using simple beaker experiments described in the project description.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: This exploratory study fits perfectly well in the study of effects of small particles dispersed in fluids. Central to this study is the creation of flow-induced microstructure with a suite of possible applications. This particular study is pointed to the use of tubeless siphons as vacuum cleaners for covering, then cleaning, contaminated substrates.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The broader impacts are technological and educational. The technological impacts are the applications, not known yet, inevitably generated by new materials. The educational aspects are two-fold. The research will impact fluid mechanics by introducing a new set of phenomena associated with flows of nanoparticle laden polymeric solutions. The second impact is on students who will get an education in this emerging field. The PI has employed over 20 undergraduates in his laboratory over the past 12 years. These undergraduates get real research experiences and they make real contributions to research. At present five undergraduates are employed. They are supported under REU supplement. The proposed research will impact these students, and the others, in the opportunities of nanoscience and nanotechnology.\r\n",
