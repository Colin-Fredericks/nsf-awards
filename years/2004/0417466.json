 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed effort is a synthesis of theory and observations of the\r\noceanic internal wavefield.  The work proposed is a truly\r\ncollaborative effort: the analysis of oceanic observations to ground\r\ntruth new theoretical descriptions of internal wave dynamics.  The\r\ntheoretical work proposed involves the use of a novel Hamiltonian\r\nformalism for the internal wave field, recently developed by the\r\nPI's. This has already been shown to include the high--frequency\r\ncomponent of the celebrated Garret--Munk spectrum as an exact\r\nstatistically stationary solution, as well as to account for much of\r\nthe observed spectral variability. It is proposed to develop a\r\nselection principle, based on a combination of wave turbulence and\r\nasymptotic analysis, to determine how each oceanic realization of this\r\nvariability is tied to the local nature of the forcing and\r\ndissipation, as well as to the latitude dependence of the Coriolis effect.\r\n\r\nWater in the ocean abyss is denser than water at the surface.  This\r\ndensity stratification permits a class of waves within the ocean\r\ninterior, called internal waves. These waves are apparent as the\r\ndistortion of density surfaces, and their wave-like properties are due\r\nto the restoring force of gravity.  Internal waves are one of the\r\nmajor player in ocean dynamics, as they can propagate over big\r\ndistances, interact with each other and other major players in the\r\nocean, like vorticity and currents, internal waves break and mix\r\nwater. While involved in this complex dynamics, internal waves\r\nredistribute mass, momentum, energy and tracers in the ocean.\r\nUnderstanding internal waves is a key element to understanding climate\r\nvariability, especially over long time periods.  The most difficult\r\npiece of this puzzle is the interaction of internal waves.  The investigators\r\nhave already contributed significantly to the understanding of\r\nnonlinear internal wave interactions by demonstrating the existence of\r\nan infinite family of statistically stationary solutions for the\r\ninternal wave spectrum, of which the celebrated Garrett and Munk\r\nspectrum is a member.  Now they propose to investigate whether\r\nparticular members of this infinite family are more likely than\r\nothers, as well as quantify the effects of interaction of internal\r\nwaves with other key players in the ocean.  This research will be\r\naided by the ongoing analysis of oceanic data sets and will contribute\r\ncrucial missing components to the theory of ocean mixing, weather and,\r\nultimately, climate.\r\n",
