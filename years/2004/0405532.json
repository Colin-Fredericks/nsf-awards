 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project aims to explore novel \"bottom-up\" approaches to generating micropatterns of anisotropic organic materials by exploiting the selforganization of chromonic liquid crystals on templates.  Ultimately, these approaches will be extended to the fabrication of nanopatterned anisotropic organic materials.  This research will provide important education and training to undergraduate and graduate students in materials chemistry.  The specific objectives of this research are:  1) To further our understanding of the structure-property relationships of ionic aromatic compounds and to strive to reveal the structural factors governing supramolecular interactions, optical properties, and phase properties (especially the lyotropic chromonic liquid-crystalline (LC) phase and the crystalline phase); 2) To design and synthesize long-wavelength and near infrared (NIR) absorbing compounds that self-organize into a chromonic LC phase or a crystalline phase; 3) To develop novel approaches to the micro-and nano-fabrication of functional anisotropic (direction-dependent) materials by exploiting the supramolecular interactions of the molecular constitutents, to study the properties of these materials, and to explore their potential applications.  The research will focus on using aromatic compounds that possess dichroic, fluorescent, and semiconducting properties as the molecular constituents; 4) To continue with efforts on integrating materials chemistry into organic chemistry research and education.\r\n%%%\r\nSociety's demand for diverse and bright colors continues to drive research on chromophore systems.  The design and synthesis of dichroic and fluorescent dyes and the control of their molecular order in materials is an important and useful proposition.  Many useful materials (e.g., dichroic polarizers) and devices (e.g., liquid crystal displays) depend on the self-organization of organic compounds into an ordered crystalline phase or a LC phase at some step in the manufacturing process or during the functioning of the device.  The knowledge gained from this research could further polarization and display technologies.  In addition to potential uses in the microelectronics field, micropatterned anisotropic materials may have applications as holographic films, as viewing angle-dependent optical materials, and in stereoscopic displays.  The development of novel approaches to generating nanopatterns of anisotropic organic materials may offer new opportunities to the rapidly advancing fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology.  Furthermore, the success of this research will broadly impact society because of the important uses of long-wavelength dyes and NIR materials that range from basic science to high technology applications.  As new classes of organic materials highly relevant to developing technologies are rapidly emerging, there is an increasing demand in both industry and academia for students trained in various aspects of organic and materials research.  This integrated teaching and research program introduces to students the basic knowledge and techniques for studying organic materials and provides research opportunities to both graduate and undergraduate students (including underrepresented groups) preparing them for a career that may include organic materials research, and improving their access to a teaching career in science.  Modern scientific instrumentation is also an essential tool for science education and training.  The equipment requested for this research will strengthen the infrastructure for education and research at the University of Nevada, Reno.\r\n",
