 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strong connections between the American Southwest and Mesoamerica extend back thousands of years and include a common language and culture.  Part of this common culture includes the farming of maize that originated in Central Mexico and spread to the American Southwest.  This study investigates the impact of agriculture on the patterning of genetic diversity in human populations.  Central Mexico is one of the last regions in human history where the innovation in agriculture originated and spread and is therefore an ideal place to study the impact of agriculture on human genetic structure and diversity.  This research will also be used to gain insight into longstanding questions about the relationship between genetic and cultural change in human history.  This research focuses on examining mitochondrial DNA, Y chromosome DNA, and autosomal DNA to investigate the genetic relationship between native populations in the American Southwest and Mesoamerica.  A focus of this study will be on the differences between male and female genetic histories and how these genetic histories relate to linguistic and cultural diversity in the American Southwest and Mesoamerica.  In addition, population history and migrations within North America will be studied through the creation of a database that will include genetic data from a large number of Native American groups. These data will be deposited in GenBank and other genetic databases available to the public and will provide a resource for other genetic researchers. \r\n\r\nThis multi-disciplinary study will establish collaboration betweens human geneticists, anthropologists, and historians from the United States and Mexico.  The focus of this research is of direct interest to researchers in both the U.S. and Mexico and will foster future collaboration between researchers in these two countries.  Students will be trained in molecular biological techniques and population genetics.  Active participation will be sought from students of a Mexican and/or Native American backgrounds and individuals who historically lack opportunities in the fields of anthropology, history, and genetics will be encouraged to participate.\r\n",
