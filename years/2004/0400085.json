 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project identifies a new class of stochastic programs referred to as\r\n\"Distributed Stochastic Programs,\" and develops computational approaches\r\nfor their solution.  The methodology to be studied involves a marriage of the\r\n\"Lagrangean Decomposition\" method of Guignard and Kim with the \"Stochastic\r\nDecomposition\" methods of Higle and Sen.  The primary motivation is the study of\r\nintegrated models and solution methods for enterprise-based decision making \r\nunder uncertainty.  An enterprise-based model is one that couples a variety of \r\ncomponent problems that are associated with different entities within the \r\nenterprise. Of necessity these component problems, which will typically reflect \r\noperational concerns,are finely detailed.  Their individual solutions often \r\nrequire highly specialized computational approaches that challenge current \r\ncomputing resources.  As a result, their direct incorporation within an\r\nenterprise-based model would likely lead to a model that greatly exceeds\r\ncurrent computational capabilities.  To remedy this situation, this\r\nproject advocates the use of surrogate models of the component problems\r\nthat reflect the uncertainty associated with the day-to-day operations,\r\nand are combined in a manner that permits guidance for strategic decisions.  \r\nA primary goal of this project is the development of solution methods for \r\nthe resulting class of problems based on decomposition schemes that exploit \r\nthe general structure of the enterprise model.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, the need to incorporate uncertainty\r\nwithin complex business environments has become increasingly\r\nobvious.  Many firms have invested a great deal of time and\r\nresources in developing models that can be used to assist with\r\noperational decision making.  For example, airlines typically use\r\nsophisticated models to assist with their air fleet assignments, crew\r\nscheduling, maintenance schedules, etc.  In addition to these\r\ntypes of operational decisions, firms also undertake strategic, or\r\nlong-term, decisions, such as when an airline determines\r\nwhat markets it will serve.  In general, these strategic decisions\r\nimpact the operational decisions, although neither this impact nor \r\nthe uncertainty associated with day-to-day operational decisions is\r\ntypically captured within the enterprise's strategic decision model.  \r\nThis project involves an exploration of integrated models and \r\nsolution methods for enterprise-based decision making under uncertainty.\r\n",
