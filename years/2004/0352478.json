 "awd_abstract_narration": "This thirty-three month project will develop and evaluate \"My World,\" a learner-appropriate geographic information system (GIS), data library and learning activities.  The software and accompanying data and materials will support inquiry-based learning in middle and high school Earth science, environmental science and geography classes.  The project will complete development of the software, develop a community of users, create and disseminate a data library with appropriate activities and conduct an extensive evaluation.  The software development focuses on usability and scaffolding, functionality to support standards-based instruction and compatibility with school needs.  The community development effort builds a community of GIS experts in schools who will provide input to the design, develop associated materials and provide professional development.  The project will include a core data library for the geosciences with learning activities ready for distribution.  The evaluation effort will conduct formative and summative evaluations.  Part of this plan includes a comparison to traditional and to established methods.   \r\n\r\nClose cooperation with developers and publishers is included in the work plan and the PI anticipates these materials will be included in future secondary earth science courses.\r\n\r\n",
