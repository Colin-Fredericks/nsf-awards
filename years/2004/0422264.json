 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues a Computer Science, Engineering and Mathematics (CSEM) Scholarship Program at the university.  The primary objectives of the program are to 1) increase the number of low-income students obtaining undergraduate degrees in computer science, engineering and mathematics; 2) increase the number of women and under-represented minorities obtaining undergraduate degrees in computer science, engineering and mathematics (both contributing to broader impct); 3) increase retention and graduation in these fields; and, 4) increase faculty mentoring of students as they prepare for graduate school enrollment or technology employment (the latter two representing the intellectual merit of the project).  To date, all 60 CSEM-Scholars in the present program have either graduated with a csem-degree or are in good academic standing and making progress towards degree attainment.\r\n \r\nThe project offers 118 additional scholarships of $3125 to students with financial need and who are juniors or seniors majoring in computer science, engineering or mathematics.    In addition to financial assistance, CSEM recipients participate in a variety of activities designed to support their success.  These includes faculty mentoring, faculty/industry research or internship experiences, academic advising, and enrollment in a special seminar focused on career and graduate schools information.  Finally, a newly created Corporate Advisory Board informs and advises the program team and CSEM-scholars to enhance current CSEM efforts. \r\n",
