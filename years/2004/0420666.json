 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of the proposed project is to support and expand Auburn University's extensive range of sponsored research in the nanosciences and provide for the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and associated analytical needs of advanced, cross-disciplinary nanoscale research and undergraduate/graduate level education both at Auburn University and in the surrounding region over the next 20-plus years.  This project is aimed at the acquisition of an instrument that will serve both current and anticipated needs, produce a major leap in research capabilities, and provide ample scope for addition/updating of its capabilities as research and educational needs evolve over the anticipated 20-plus year lifespan of the equipment.  The proposed instrumentation will strongly impact the performance of a wide variety of nanoscale research that crucially depends on access to advanced field-emission SEM instrumentation currently not available at Auburn or in the surrounding area.  \r\n\r\nCurrent analytical needs include greatly improved energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) for full spectrum imaging and component and phase analysis and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) for investigating thin film polycrystalline microstructures for crystallographic texture, grain boundary analysis, and qualitative strain mapping. Other highly desirable characteristics are high resolution at low energy combined with a variable pressure chamber for biological imaging. The instrument will represent a substantial increase in imaging and analytical capabilities not currently available at Auburn or the surrounding area.\r\n\r\nCompared with existing instrumentation at AU, this system will provide numerous major improvements, including [1] vastly enhanced maximum resolution, more than an order of magnitude better than the existing SEM, especially at low accelerating voltages; [2] greatly enhanced and additional high-resolution analytical capabilities; [3] improved stage traverse range, tilt and stability and full stage automation; [4] radical improvement in digital imaging capabilities; and [5] a capability for remote on-line operation, telepresence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the proposed project is to support and expand Auburn University's extensive range of sponsored research in the nanosciences and provide for the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and associated analytical needs of advanced, cross-disciplinary nanoscale research and undergraduate/graduate level education both at Auburn University and in the surrounding region over the next 20-plus years.
