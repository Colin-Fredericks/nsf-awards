The purpose of the institute is to explore the boundaries of sustainability of aquatic systems through adaptive management.  The long-term goal is to promote collaborative research and education programs in this important area. \r\n\r\nThe PASI will explore how closely the conservation of biodiversity can co-exist alongside water resource development, with specific emphasis on hydropower projects.  Two meetings will be hosted to present the current state of understanding in the Americas and to coordinate current research activities and student exchanges at participating institutions.  A scientific framework considering adaptive management will be developed in order to learn from observed ecological consequences of hydropower projects and improve criteria for designing future projects and selecting river systems that should be protected. \r\n\r\n",
