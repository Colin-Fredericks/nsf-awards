 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports Professor Richard D. Adams at the University of South Carolina to synthesize new metal cluster complexes containing sulfide, disulfido and related chalcogen ligands for use in preparing new nanoscale metal sulfide materials with novel physical and catalytic properties.  Investigations will include structural characterizations of metal carbonyl sulfide and disulfide complexes and reactivity studies of small, unsaturated organic molecules and metal-ligand groups at the sulfur atoms.  Studies of reactivity at the metal atoms toward donor ligands and small organic molecules will also be undertaken.  These compounds will be used as precursors for new nanoscale materials with novel physical and chemical properties that should lead to a deeper understanding of nanoscale material properties. \r\n\r\nMetal sulfides play key roles in materials science: in phosphors, in lubricants, as catalysts, in semiconducting and even superconducting materials. This research will lead to the synthesis of new inorganic materials and nano-materials that will exhibit novel properties for catalysis and semiconductors.  Students will be trained in the design, synthesis and characterization of inorganic and organometallic compounds, and in the use of modern analytical techniques, such as infrared spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry and other types of electronic spectroscopy measurements.  \r\n",
