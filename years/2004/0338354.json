The thinking to Learn. Institute model will be evaluated as a means to provide university disciplinary students with research-based teaching strategies through careful research protocols.   The impact of the institutes and workshops on pedagogical content knowledge on teacher knowledge and practice, curriculum selection and implementation, and ultimately on middle school student science performance will also be studied. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  The project will provide a national example of how graduate and advanced undergraduate students from multiple disciplines in a master.s degree granting regional university can acquire and apply research-based teaching strategies. Participants will have a systemic impact resulting in improved middle school student science learning and teacher content and pedagogical knowledge and practice in schools with high populations of Native American and Hispanic children. As a result of involvement of science faculty, the project will have a sustainable impact on undergraduate and graduate science teaching and learning. The Thinking to Learn. Institute, which will be embedded into the graduate science curriculum, is an innovative and replicable model for all higher education institutions.  This project is receiving partial support from funds from the Directorate of Geosciences. \r\n",
