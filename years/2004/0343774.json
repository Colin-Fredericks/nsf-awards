 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microencapsulation is the process of embedding an additive in a colloidal particle.\r\nThis technology is widely used to provide extended release of entrapped compounds such\r\nas drugs or fragrances. However, microencapsulation may be used to produce composite\r\nparticles with controlled optical, chemical, or physical properties for a wealth of\r\napplications. Current microencapsulation technology typically requires organic solvents\r\nthat are difficult to remove from the polymer. Residual solvent is especially undesirable for\r\nfood and drug applications where the maximum allowable concentration is very low. We\r\npropose to study the transport of additives into colloidal polymer particles dispersed in an\r\nemulsion of liquid or supercritical carbon dioxide and water in an effort to reduce or\r\neliminate the need for organic solvents. At elevated pressures, carbon dioxide swells and\r\nplasticizes the polymer particles, facilitating mass transport. Surfactants are used to\r\nstabilize the emulsion of CO2 and water. The surfactants also adsorb on the surface of the\r\nparticles to enhance colloidal stability. After depressurization, the polymer particles return\r\nto their original size and shape, entrapping the additive. The adsorbed surfactant remains\r\non the surface and thus offers a route to controlling the surface chemistry of the particles.\r\nBiodegradable and biocompatible polymer colloids will be impregnated with drugs,\r\nchromophores, and luminescent nanoparticles with the aid of CO2, water, and non-toxic\r\nsurfactants. In addition, we propose to couple CO2 processing with traditional\r\nmicroencapsulation techniques to lower residual solvent content and sterilize polymer\r\nparticles. The proposed research will provide a flexible, biologically and environmentally\r\nfriendly route to the production of composite particles used as devices for drug delivery,\r\ntracers and indicators for drug discovery and genomics, and other composite colloidal\r\nparticles useful for catalysis, coatings, and optical materials. To broaden the impact of the\r\nproposed research, a computer based instructional module on microencapsulation\r\ntechnology will be developed and incorporated into the course 'Interfacial Engineering' at\r\nthe University of Rochester with the assistance of a commercial educational software\r\nvendor. The software vendor has expressed interest in incorporating the module into their\r\nexisting software for broader distribution. Undergraduate and graduate students from\r\ndiverse backgrounds will be recruited to work on the project through existing programs at\r\nthe University of Rochester.",
