 "awd_abstract_narration": "The support from this grant allows the Department of Mathematical\r\nSciences at the University of Alabama in Huntsville to\r\npurchase and assemble on-site  a 17-node, 34-processor Scyld Beowulf\r\nCluster\r\nusing commodity personal computer technology.\r\nThis equipment is dedicated to the support of computationally intensive\r\napplied mathematics research.  \r\nMajor thrust areas of this research program include:\r\nRobust feedback control of fluid flows and combustion, bifurcation\r\nanalysis\r\nfor large scale systems, numerical simulation of relativistic plasma\r\nand the modeling and simulation of epidemics transmission.\r\nThe projects specifically included in the grant proposal are:\r\n(1) Robust feedback control of fluids and combustion systems.\r\n(2) Bifurcation analysis for large problems: algorithms, software,\r\napplications to MEMS.\r\n(3) Detailed numerical calculation of the equation of state for a\r\nrelativistic pair plasma.\r\n(4) Modeling impacts of environment changes on\r\ntransmission of mosquito-borne epidemics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey develop complex mathematical models, feedback control methods \r\ncomputational algorithms and sofware for applications such as\r\ncombustion instabilty for novel combustors, reducing drag/increasing\r\nlift\r\nfor better maneuverability of vehicles, dynamics\r\nof Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) products, dynamics\r\nof mosquito borne diseases and impacts of environmental changes,\r\nand astrophysical simulations of high energy sources.\r\nThe impact of these projects will be felt across a broad spectrum of\r\nproblems in science and engineering and in the training of a new\r\ngeneration of applied mathematicians skilled in parallel computation.\r\nAdditionally, the machines will greatly enhance departmental research\r\nand education infrastructure at all levels. They will be made\r\navailable to all departmental faculty, undergraduate and\r\ngraduate students.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
