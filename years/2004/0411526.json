GPOTS is an annual conference (24 years old) that is hosted every year in May at\r\na different university. Although the name is of a \"regional\" character, it has evolved into a\r\nconference of a true international scope. Texas A&M University has agreed to provide the\r\nneeded facilities, and local funding will cover the expenses of the plenary speakers. Local\r\narrangements for lecture rooms and housing have already been made. The funding we seek from\r\nNSF will be used specifically to provide partial support for the other participants, with emphasis\r\non postdocs, graduate students, and younger faculty who are doing excellent research but may not\r\nhave current grants. The plenary speakers will be world-class researchers and expositors whose\r\nlectures emphasize break-through areas and applications of interest to the participants. Eight\r\nplenary speakers have already accepted our invitation to speak. Many of the regular participants\r\nwill give shorter talks, including a number of graduate students currently working on their\r\ndoctorates. We expect between 100 and 150 participants. The seven members of the GPOTS-\r\n2004 local organizing committee at Texas A&M University are: Ronald Douglas, Kenneth\r\nDykema, David Larson, Carl Pearcy, Gilles Pisier, Roger Smith, and Nico Spronk.\r\n\r\n",
