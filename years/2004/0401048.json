The objective\r\nis to generalize method used in previous work of Sverak and\r\nPI to construct counterexamples in lower target dimensions,\r\nas well as to understand regularity property of minimizers\r\nunder further assumptions on the integrand. The second part\r\ndeals with regularity property of minimizers for both\r\ncompressible and incompressible models from nonlinear elasticity.\r\nThe main feature here is the singular behavior of the integrand\r\nin the compressible case and nonlinear nonconvex constraint in\r\nthe incompressible case. Currently there is no general method to\r\ndeal with regularity problems for such integral. We hope that\r\nthe simple model problems studied in this project can help to\r\ngain insight into more general cases. The third part addresses\r\ninterfacial coarsening phenomenon observed in many energy-driven\r\nmodels from materials science. In particular, the aim is to provide\r\nrigorous analysis on the value of the coarsening exponent for different\r\nmodels. The analysis is closely related to deep and interesting issues\r\nin calculus of variations, e.g.gamma limit of singularly perturbed\r\nvariational problems. The well developed tools from those areas provide a\r\nbetter vision on the last project.\r\n\r\n   The questions to be studied are motivated both by classical theory of\r\noptimization and contemporary issues in nonlinear elasticity and materials\r\nscience. An outstanding open question in continuum mechanics is to determine\r\nwhat singularities might exist in surfaces which optimize a collection of\r\nnonlinear constraints. Knowledge of this type can help in the design of\r\nexotic materials. The study of coarsening is important for both bulk and\r\nthin film materials. Such materials are of great practical interest. For\r\nexample, superconducting thin film devices are presently being evaluated for\r\npossible use in high-performance microwave filters and other applications.\r\n",
