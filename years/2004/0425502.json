 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will provide partial support for the Eighth International Conference on Precipitation, planned for August 8-11, 2004 in Vancouver, British Columbia. This conference series promotes interaction among those atmospheric scientists, hydrologists, mathematicians, and statisticians who are interested in precipitation. The theme this year is quantifying uncertainty related to precipitation, and four sub-themes have been selected: (a) the verification of climate scale estimates of precipitation; (b) the quantification of uncertainties in nonliquid precipitation (especially snow); (c) the connection between atmospheric properties and rainfall statistical characteristics, and (d) strategies for improving synergies between models and observation. The conference organizers intend to produce a series of white papers following the conference that will help define the status of the field and the opportunities for the future. About 150 conference participants are expected, including many graduate students and postdocs. Substantial other support for the conference is also expected; about 10 participants can be supported fully by the NSF grant, which will also provide some support for travel arrangements and the production of publications and conference materials.",
