 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Robert Noyce Urban Mathematics Educator Program (UMEP) is increasing the number of high-quality secondary mathematics teachers who teach in urban school districts and are committed to remaining in urban school environments. The project is awarding stipends to 40 UMEP students (10 per year) who hold a baccalaureate, masters or doctoral degree in mathematics, science, or a related field and commit to teaching in the Atlanta Public Schools or the DeKalb County School System.  The UMEP students are matriculated into the Teacher Education Environment Mathematics and Science (TEEMS) Program at Georgia State University. TEEMS is a Master's Degree alternative certification program that began in 1994 as a nontraditional approach to mathematics and science teacher education for grades 7 through 12.  The UMEP program includes strategies to recruit talented individuals with mathematics backgrounds who demonstrate a commitment to teach secondary mathematics in urban high need schools. UMEP students participate in the Metro-Atlanta Beginning Teacher Induction and Support Consortium, an induction program that provides personal, group, and web contact between beginning teachers and mentors. Mentoring is provided from entry into the program through the first three years of teaching and includes participation in Professional Learning Communities consisting of UMEP students, the UMEP Leadership Team, teacher mentors, and TEEMS faculty. The evaluation plans focus on the effectiveness of the UMEP program in recruiting, preparing, and retaining high quality mathematics teachers.  The project includes a longitudinal research component to investigate how the alternative certification program prepares high quality teachers for urban school environments.",
