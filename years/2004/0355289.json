 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) consists of 4 km baseline interferometric gravitational wave detectors in Livingston, LA and Hanford, WA, and an additional 2 km detector in Hanford. The LIGO Science Collaboration, of which Louisiana State University (LSU) is a member, has begun taking data with the LIGO detectors, and analyzing it looking for gravitational waves from different kinds of astrophysical sources. The detectors are expected to achieve their design sensitivity in late 2004-early 2005, when science runs 6 months or longer will begin.\r\n\r\nThe PI's group at LSU will work on three different critical aspects of the final phase of the commissioning of the LIGO Observatories and the initial phase of data analysis activities of the LIGO Science Collaboration:\r\n(1) diagnostics and control of angular degrees of freedom in the LIGO detectors;\r\n(2) several detector characterization projects (studying statistical properties of the\r\nnoise, the presence of bicoherence in the gravitational wave signals, cataloging transients, improving calibration of the gravitational wave channel); and\r\n(3) using the results of these studies as veto criteria in the data analysis effort for bursts and inspiral gravitational wave signals.\r\n\r\nThe group's results will contribute significantly to the improvement of the detectors' sensitivity, to the understanding of the quality and features of the data obtained, and to the data analysis looking for astrophysical signals. This project involves faculty, postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students doing research at the cutting edge of gravitational wave astrophysics. The work is a combination of hands-on experimental work, investigations of noise sources, and data analysis techniques that will provide a great learning experience for the undergraduate and graduate students in the project, who will be able to perform their research at the LIGO Livingston Observatory itself, only 30 miles from LSU.\r\n",
