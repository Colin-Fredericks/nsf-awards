 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Coordination Network: Integrating Ecology and Endocrinology in Avian Reproduction.  \r\nJohn C. Wingfield \r\n\r\n\r\nThis network will coordinate research activities of ecologists, and endocrinologists on a specific theme - reproduction in birds. Research will cover the full spectrum from field ecology to molecular mechanisms. A critical goal is to develop a framework whereby organismal biologists can communicate effectively with cell/molecular biologists (endocrinology) and bridge a conceptual rift that has been widening for several decades. Avian reproduction provides an ideal focus because of extensive literature from genes to ecosystems. The proposed collaboration and the resulting network will have direct application to programs integrating organisms and molecules throughout biological sciences. \r\nThe network will allow educational revision at K-12, undergraduate and graduate levels and will facilitate a truly integrative, biology curriculum including conservation biology. Activities will include workshops aimed at developing ecologically based studies at physiological, cell and molecular levels. Technical meetings will identify mechanisms that can be brought to bear on novel investigations including those with conservation emphasis. Laboratory exchange visits involving faculty and students will follow workshops. A web site will be developed to promote this new framework as well as collect databases that can be used for research analysis and education. Links to this web site will be made with other national and international groups so that network resources will be available to all of the scientific community, K-12 schools and the public at large. Faculty and student participants have been identified that represent diversity and more will be specifically invited to participate.\r\n\r\n",
