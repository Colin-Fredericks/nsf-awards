As an example of the\r\ntimeliness of this problem, the Oregon Forest Practices Act was modified (in response to five\r\ndeaths, resulting from two 1996 debris flows) to adopt and enforce forest practice rules that will\r\nreduce the occurrence, timing, and effects of rapidly moving landslides.\r\nThe proposed research will focus on a physics-based characterization of near-surface\r\nhydrologic response and slope stability initiation processes for steep hillslopes at the catchment\r\nscale. This characterization will be based upon sophisticated numerical simulations for the Coos\r\nBay experimental catchment (CB1). The 860m 2 CB1 is located in the Oregon Coast Range. CB1\r\nis an unchanneled valley, with a north-facing aspect, that has an average slope of 43. In the area\r\nof CB1, the Coast Range exhibits steep, finely dissected hillslopes where debris flows are the\r\ndominant geomorphic process. The instrumentation at CB1, used to characterize the spatial and\r\ntemporal variability in near-surface hydrologic response for three sprinkler/tracer experiments (in\r\n1990 and 1992), includes an exhaustive grid of rain gages, piezometers, tensiometers, TDR\r\nwave-guide pairs, lysimeters, meteorological sensors, and weirs. Continuous measurements of\r\nrainfall, discharge, and total head are available for CB1 from 1990 through 1996.\r\nRigorous simulation of near-surface hydrologic response will be conducted with the\r\nIntegrated Hydrology Model (InHM). The comprehensive InHM quantitatively simulates, with a\r\nfirst-order coupled approach, 3D variably-saturated flow and solute transport in porous media\r\nand macropores and 2D flow and solute transport over the surface and in open channels. There is\r\nno a priori assumption of a specific hydrologic-response mechanism with InHM. The two slope\r\nstability models to be employed in the proposed study are the infinite slope model and a 2D\r\nfinite-element solution to the linear elastic deformation equations.\r\nThe proposed research would be conducted in three phases. In phase I, event-based InHM\r\nsimulations of fluid flow and solute transport will be conducted for the three CB1 sprinkler/tracer\r\nexperiments to characterize hydrologic-response and pore water pressure distributions. In phase\r\nII, long-term InHM simulations of hydrologic response (for the seven year CB1 record) will be\r\nconducted to generate continuous pore water pressure distributions. In phase III, slope stability\r\nsimulations (driven by hydrologic-response simulations in phases I and II), with the two slope\r\nstability models, will be conducted to assess slope failure initiation for CB1. The CB1 data sets\r\n(discharge, pressure head, soil-water content, and solute concentration) will be used in a rigorous\r\nassessment of model performance. The coupled simulation of hydrologic response and slope\r\nstability will be used to evaluate slope failure at times of known stability and times of known\r\ninstability (i.e., the November 1996 CB1 failure).\r\nRelated to intellectual merit, the proposed simulation effort will effectively demonstrate the\r\nutility and/or limits of hydrologic-response models less comprehensive than InHM for field\r\nconditions similar to CB1 and beyond. It will also be possible guide the structure of new models\r\n(simpler than InHM) for use in the decision-management arena based upon dominant response\r\ngeneralizations of InHM results for what if scenarios. Related to broader impact, results from the\r\nproposed study will be useful for the optimization of data collection networks for both future\r\nstudies of hydrologic response/landslide initiation and real-time hazard warning systems. A\r\nmajor contribution of the proposed work is the training of a PhD student.",
