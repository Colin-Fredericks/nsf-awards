The methods developed will handle an extensive set of optimizations and could be used to implement fully automatic certifiers for a wide range of compilers.\r\nPrevious work has developed:\r\n1. the theory of a \"correct translation\"; 2. a general proof rule for translation validation of \"structure preserving\"    optimizations;\r\n3. TVOC -- a tool that implements the proof rule on an EPIC compiler (SGI Pro-64) and sends the proof obligations to be verified by a theorem prover (SRI's ICS.) \r\n4. a proof rule for dealing with many \"structure modifying\"   transformations, mostly loop optimizations; The proposed work extends the previous work as follows:\r\n1.develop the theory, and the supporting tools, that deal with inter- and intra-procedural optimizations.  \r\n2. build a special-purpose theorem prover will be built on top of CVC that will    be tailored to handle the verification conditions generated by the methodology.\r\n3. identify and construct run-time checks of speculative optimizations.  In addition, it will perform a compile-time validation of the transformation.\r\n4.Extend scoppe of project to machine-dependent optimizations, involving instruction scheduling and (software as well as hardware) pipelining.  This project will provide a major step towards ensuring an extremely high level of confidence in compilers in areas, such as safety-critical systems and compilation into silicon, where correctness is of paramount concern. \r\n",
