 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The FACES program is a significant ongoing commitment by the Georgia\r\nInstitute of Technology, Emory University, Morehouse College, and Spelman College to\r\nincrease the national representation of minorities (URMs) in the engineering and the\r\nsciences professoriate. The program is comprised of several components, and the aggregate\r\nprogram addresses each critical step along the path to an academic career. To provide a\r\nmechanism for the early recruitment of students into research and academic careers, FACES\r\nwill establish a Research Careers Office at Morehouse College. Furthermore, undergraduates\r\nwho have completed their sophomore year are provided summer and academic year research\r\nexperiences as a means of promoting their interest in research and graduate school\r\nattendance. These students are then encouraged to enroll in graduate programs using a\r\nseries of recruitment efforts at national events such as the NSBE Annual Convention or\r\nAnnual Biomedical Research Conference for Minority Students (ABRCMS), campus visits and\r\ntours, and a lecture/workshop series on the merit of graduate school and careers in\r\nacademia. Admitted Georgia Tech and Emory graduate students are supported on doctoral\r\nfellowship supplements throughout their matriculation. Graduate student support is\r\nprovided by means of a stipend which increases in value as the student meets the critical\r\nmilestones along the way toward the Ph.D. Another portion of these funds is used to\r\nsupport travel to technical meetings for research presentations. Finally, senior doctoral\r\nstudents compete for Career Initiation Grants, which they may use as start-up funds to\r\nassist in establishing their research programs in their initial academic appointments.\r\nAssessment of program outcomes will be performed annually.\r\nBroader Impact: This program is a blending of the resources of these universities to focus\r\nspecifically on increasing the production of URMs who earn engineering and science\r\ndoctoral degrees. This proposal has been initiated by African American faculty who are\r\ncommitted to this goal and recognize that success breeds success. Recruiting, mentoring\r\nand academic support programs initiated by Georgia Tech, Emory, Morehouse and Spelman have\r\nbeen quite successful in increasing retention, grades, and overall production of URM\r\ndegree candidates. Our partnership has created a pipeline of successful African American\r\nundergraduates and this proposal describes a doctoral-focused program that builds on the\r\nsuccessful undergraduate efforts. As one of the leading producers of minority engineers\r\nand scientists, this alliance is ideally positioned to increase the national production of\r\nAfrican American students who earn doctorates and promote their representation in academic\r\ncareers. With the assistance of NSF funding to keep the program elements in place, FACES\r\nwill continue to provide a mechanism to \"change the face\" of the national engineering and\r\nscience professoriate, substantially improving the current dearth of underrepresented\r\nengineering and science faculty.",
