This is an   in-depth investigation on the processing of polymer-particulate nanocomposites and their mechanical, fracture and multi-functional attributes for two different polymer systems, thermosetting resins and thermo plastics. The cooperative research will involve Professors Arun Shukla, Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics, University of Rhode Island (URI) and P. Venkitnarayanan, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK).  The constitutive response of the nanocomposites will be evaluated at high strain rates. The behavior of stationary and propagating cracks in polymer nanocomposites under dynamic conditions will be performed using ultra-high speed photography and optical interferometry. Evaluation of properties at finer length scales will be attempted leading to the development of predictive models.\r\n\r\nScope: The investigators at both institutions have expertise in processing and characterizing novel engineered materials and have successfully collaborated in the past under NSF's joint program with India's Department of Science & Technology. \r\nThis project combines the diverse expertise of the PIs in composites and offers access to specialized facilities at the respective institutions.  This research will involve students, technicians and faculty members at both institutions and result in senior projects, technical papers, presentations, and dissertations.  Visiting faculty members and students will receive valuable exposure to the challenges of material synthesis and various experimental techniques used for mechanical and fracture characterization of novel materials. There will be quick dissemination and exchange of knowledge through the respective institutes websites.  \r\n\r\n",
