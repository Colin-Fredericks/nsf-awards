 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator considers a physical system representing a porous\r\nmedium, such as a groundwater aquifer or a petroleum reservoir.  The\r\nmovement of, e.g., a contaminant or oil over several kilometers is\r\nstrongly influenced by the properties of the intervening rock.  What\r\nappears to us to be bulk fluid flow is actually a complex process of\r\nfluid flowing through high and low permeability regions.  To simulate\r\nthe flow, one generally uses a coarse computational grid.  In subgrid\r\nupscaling, one incorporates fine-scale processes within the coarse\r\ngrid cells through a local and easily computed subgrid technique.  The\r\nprojects objective is to obtain provably improved accuracy and\r\ncomputational efficiency.  Moreover, since this technique provides a\r\ngood and easily computed approximation to the fine-scale movement of\r\nthe fluids, the technique will be adapted so that the full fine-scale\r\nproblem itself can be solved in significantly less time. \r\nOne post-doc, two graduate students, and one undergraduate student\r\nwill be involved in the research, and educated in the\r\ninterdisciplinary environment.  The work will be disseminated at\r\ninterdisciplinary meetings and in the mathematics, groundwater, and\r\nreservoir simulation literature to maximize its impact.\r\n\r\nThe contamination of groundwater is one of the most serious\r\nenvironmental problems facing the nation.  Improvements to the\r\npredictive capabilities of groundwater simulations in heterogeneous\r\nformations would have a wide-ranging impact.  The engineering of\r\npetroleum and natural gas production uses heavily subsurface\r\nsimulation technologies as well.  The subgrid upscaling method has\r\nshown great promise, and this proposal will further its development\r\nwhile promoting important educational and societal objectives.",
