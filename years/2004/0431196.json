 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past several years, there has been a great deal of research to \r\nimprove performance of wireless communications in fading environments by exploiting \r\ntransmitter and/or receiver diversity and spatial multiplexing. The pioneering work by Telatar, \r\nFoschini and Gans showed that multiple antenna radios (MAR) in a wireless communication system \r\ncan greatly improve the performance. The major roadblock to MAR being a financially viable \r\noption for wireless communications is the cost of the analog portions of the radio. \r\nPoint--to--point MAR systems employing complex signaling and signal processing algorithms have been \r\ndesigned and built and have achieved performance very close to the outage capacity.  \r\nThe remaining gains that are achievable in MAR will only be exploited by considering the cost \r\nand complexity of analog circuitry in MAR signalling and signal processing, by considering more \r\ncomplex models for wireless propagation, and by putting MAR in networking context. The \r\nfocus of this effort is to push MAR technology by exploiting the structure in these more \r\ncomplex models and networking scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the effort can be succinctly stated as:\r\n1) Communication theory is often interested in normalizing performance \r\nfor a fixed average power but in wireless implementations the peak \r\npower is a more critical driver than the average power.  The research \r\nis examining optimization of performance and throughput with a peak \r\npower constraint in multiple antenna radio.\r\n2) Feedback communication is likely going to enable a significant \r\nimprovement in throughput and demodulator complexity in a networked \r\nscenario especially in environments with low mobility (e.g., wireless \r\ncomputer networks).  This research is approaching feedback \r\ncommunication with a classic scientific method of iterating between \r\nexperimentation on real channels and more realistic theoretical problem \r\nformulations based on the results derived in experimentation.\r\n3) The cost driver in wireless communication currently is the analog \r\ncircuitry.  This research is examining techniques that would minimize \r\nthe complexity of the analog systems in a multiple antenna radio. The \r\nobjectives are to being met by the following research tasks\r\na) Improved channel parameterization for long range prediction for \r\nmultiple antenna radio,\r\nb) Design and field testing of a variety of MAR automatic repeat \r\nrequest algorithms,\r\nc) Experimentation with the proposed feedback algorithms for MAR,\r\nd) Feedback algorithms for MAR with constant envelop modulations,\r\ne) Feedback algorithms for MAR with limited analog capabilities,\r\n",
