 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal concerns two topics in controlled surgery. The first is a \r\nhomotoy-theoretic approach to controlled surgery on Poincare spaces of \r\ndimension 4 and greater. This provides input for a limit construction \r\nof homology manifolds. The principal new conclusion would be \r\nconstruction of exotic homology manifolds in dimension 4 (the \r\nBryant-Ferry-Mio-Weinberger construction works in 6 and above) and, via \r\na known resolution theorem, a proof of the 4-dimensional topological \r\nsurgery conjecture. The second topic is a variation on surgery groups \r\nmaking use of controlled K-theory. This should have better formal \r\nproperties, for instance should more often satisfy the Farrell-Jones \r\nisomorphism conjecture.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal concerns controlled surgery on Poincare spaces. Poincare \r\nspaces have global homological duality similar to that of manifolds. \r\nGiven a map to a metric space one can measure the \"size\" of the duality \r\nstructure: how far one must go to find dual cycles. Manifolds have \r\nduality with size 0 because duality follows from the local structure. \r\nPoincare spaces generally have no constraints, so the size is the \r\ndiameter of the control space. The key part of the proposal is a \r\nsize-reducing process: given a Poincare space with duality of size \r\nepsilon, find an equivalent Poincare space with much smaller size \r\ncontrol. The approach proposed should work for spaces of dimension 4 \r\nand above. In this case it would provide input to an elaborate but \r\nalready established argument to give a proof of the 4-dimensional \r\ntopological surgery conjecture. This conjecture is the major unresolved \r\nproblem in topology in dimension 4.\r\n\r\n",
