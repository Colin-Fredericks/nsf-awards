 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the leadership of two principal investigators, this project will study the electronic properties of highest quality two-dimensional electron systems at ultra-low temperatures and in very high magnetic fields. When exposed to such extreme conditions, electrons exhibit bizarre properties such as the fractional quantum Hall effect. This research is expected to unravel novel quantum phases of the low-dimensional electron systems and to characterize their properties. There is significant probability of new physics discoveries as the experiments explore novel tunable electron density devices with highly sensitive and versatile inelastic light scattering techniques at millikelvin temperatures. The project involves overall synergy from close collaboration between sample synthesis, optics and electron transport studies. The project is of a fundamental nature and offers venues for the training of graduate students and postdocs in a combination of techniques that are at the forefront of today's research.  In addition, there is a healthy connection to traditional semiconductor processing and field effect transistor research.\r\n\r\nThis project addresses the bizarre properties of collections of electrons in semiconductor layers exposed to ultrahigh magnetic fields and very low temperatures. Under these extreme conditions, electrons confined within semiconductors exhibit fractional charge and vanishing resistance. The proposed research will be carried out under the supervision of two principal investigators. The project intends to move the field to a new regime of by synthesizing the cleanest semiconducting materials ever created, pushing to the lowest electron densities ever reached, and by performing optical and electrical experiments at the lowest achievable temperatures. The expectation is to observe novel, complex emerging properties. The research is of a fundamental nature and addresses the question, which lies at the very heart of modern condensed matter physics: how do complex properties arise within systems made from many simple, identical components? In a broader context, the proposed research deepens our understanding of quantum mechanics, which is presently considered for enhanced information processing. On the educational side,  the research trains young scientists in a field that brings together exceptional experimental techniques, forefront areas of semiconductor materials synthesis, ultra-low temperature and high magnetic field technology, challenging theoretical issues, and advanced numerical computation methods. This experience will prepare students for careers in academe, industry or government.\r\n",
