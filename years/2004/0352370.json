 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the development of a computer-driven, automated device for screening libraries of small molecules on planaria. The proof-of-principle device will consist of about 100 cells, each containing a single planarian and one element of the library to be screened. Each cell will provide for observation and analysis of worm behavior and morphology via a digital camera and for the reward/punishment of certain behaviors by modification of light levels and mild electric shock. The cells will be continuously analyzed and controlled by a computer which will screen for specified results (for example, screening the library for a reagent which increases worm motility, alters head  development, counteracts the effects of toxins, or accelerates the rate of learning in operant conditioning). The computer will detect changes in morphology, behavior, and other parameters.   Initial development of the device will be focused on planaria, but the final version will be useful for many organisms (including transgenics carrying fluorescent reporters for analysis of specific traits). It will enable screening of libraries of small molecules, RNAi, proteins, antibodies, and others. Potential targets to be searched for include reagents which:  improve memory, increase or decrease motor activity, modify neuronal growth, counteract effects of known drugs, enhance or dampen sensory modalities, alter morphology during regeneration, slow aging, accelerate or decelerate metabolism, or act as an anti-toxin to known poisonous compounds.",
