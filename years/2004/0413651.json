These three areas of topology have historically enjoyed\r\nvigorous and productive scientific interactions, spurring\r\nimportant innovations through sharing ideas.  Moreover,\r\ndevelopments and problems in these subjects in topology are\r\nconnected to parallel questions in other branches of geometry,\r\nanalysis and algebraic geometry, where there are foundational\r\nquestions concerning extending \"classical\" methods from smooth\r\n(nonsingular) settings to more general ones in which\r\nsingularities can arise. Exciting recent developments to be\r\ndiscussed at this meeting include investigations on how\r\nsingularities of embeddings and immersions in four-dimensional\r\nmanifolds are shedding new light on basic questions concerning\r\nclassification and structure of four dimensional manifolds; and\r\nhow such questions also interact with new approaches to deep\r\ninvariants of knots and links in three dimensional manifolds and\r\ntheir cobordisms. Also to be discussed are various theories of\r\ncharacteristic clases for singular varieties and foundational\r\nquestions concerning their definitions, calculational methods,\r\nand applications, e.g., to current developments in transformation\r\ngroups and to geometrical combinatorics of polytopes.\r\n\r\nThis research conference on important, current geometrical\r\napproaches to topology will bring together researchers and\r\nstudents who are investigating some mathemtically basic,\r\nubiquitous and related topological phenomena from several\r\ndifferent perspectives. These involve spaces, called varieties,\r\nthat can have variable geometry at different points. Such\r\nvariations in geometry, called singularities, can be analyzed\r\nusing mathematical theories of knots and links (in many\r\ndimnensions); to elucidate this, such varieties are decomposed\r\ninto strata. Because the natural spaces that arise in many\r\nresearch problems in both mathematics and theoretical physics\r\ndisplay such singularities, investigations of such varieties, of\r\ntheir strata and their singularities, and of related questions\r\nabout knots and links are needed.  Recent and exciting\r\ndevelopments to be analyzed include relations of such questions\r\nto four dimensional geometry, to the symmetries and invariants of\r\nsuch spaces, and to applications to problems in enumeration and\r\ncombinatorics that arise in a very wide range of scientific\r\nproblems.\r\n",
