 "awd_abstract_narration": "For bridges and other structures subject to lateral loadings, passive earth pressure contributes\r\nsignificantly to overall stability. While the maximum passive pressure acting on pile caps and\r\nabutment walls can readily be predicted, the issue of how passive pressure develops as a function of\r\ndeflection is more problematic. Furthermore, essentially all of the load-displacement relationships\r\ncurrently used are derived from static or extremely slow loadings. Under seismic loading conditions,\r\nboth dynamic and cyclic effects are present which alter the load-deflection relationship. While cyclic\r\nloading effects typically reduce the strength and stiffness of the soil, dynamic loading effects tend to\r\nproduce an apparent increase in soil strength and stiffness due to material and radiation damping.\r\nFaced with the lack of well-defined load-displacement relationships which address the effects of both\r\nstiffness degradation and increased damping, the engineering community has often applied static\r\nload-deflection relationships in seismic design situations. The degree to which this approach is\r\nconservative or non-conservative is uncertain. What is certain, however, is that soil stiffness at\r\nabutment contacts is a critical factor in overall bridge performance.\r\n\r\nOur vision for this project is to develop load-displacement relationships for typical soils\r\nadjacent to pile caps and abutments based on full-scale testing, which account for both dynamic and\r\ncyclic effects. Incorporation of dynamic effects into passive earth pressure relationships would\r\ncreate a validated definition of dynamic and cyclic soil response that has previously been\r\nunavailable. Although shake table and centrifuge models can provide important guidance regarding\r\nthese issues, a reasonable number of full-scale load tests are necessary to provide ground truth\r\ninformation. This research would fulfill this need. In terms of intellectual merit, the proposed\r\ntesting and analysis will provide practitioners with dynamic stiffness and damping factors based on\r\nfull-scale pile cap tests for a variety of soil types and densities, as well as for a range of vibration\r\nfrequencies and displacement levels. In addition, the test results, archived in the NEES database,\r\nwill become important benchmarks for researchers interested in calibrating/verifying new computer\r\ncodes or numerical models.\r\n\r\nTo obtain the data needed to develop dynamic, passive load-displacement relationships, a\r\nfield testing program will be conducted. This program will consist of laterally loading a concrete pile\r\ncap without backfill and then reloading after backfilling with four different soils type. Since the\r\nresistance provided by the backfill is a function of density, each backfill will be compacted to two\r\ndifferent densities and then tested. Loading will be accomplished by a combined use of a hydraulic\r\nload actuator and NEES-UCLA's eccentric mass shakers. Initially, a hydraulic load shaker will load\r\nthe cap to a target deflection, at which point the actuator length will be fixed. Next, eccentric shakers\r\nmounted atop the pile cap will be activated to produce a dynamic loading. The combined use of\r\nactuator and shaker will provide levels and rates of strain previously unobtainable in full-scale\r\ntesting. The frequency of the shakers will be varied to obtain a range of loading frequencies. This\r\nloading process will then be repeated at increasing levels of deflection. Subsequent data analysis will\r\nquantify the observed passive earth pressure relationships in a series of curves and corresponding\r\nequations. Additional analytical work will determine dynamic impedances of the backfill based on\r\nspring and dashpot models.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include improved design of structural components\r\nthrough a better definition of the geotechnical component of soil-structure interaction. Additional\r\nimpacts include mentored educational experiences for participating university students as well as\r\nincreased awareness of earthquake engineering issues by junior high and high school students\r\nparticipating in an outreach program centered on the research performed.",
