 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanical behavior of granular materials is still only partially \r\nundertsood even though many continuum models have been proposed. The \r\ngoal of this project is to build, study, implement and test efficient \r\nand reliable numerical methods allowing for a quantitative study and \r\ncomparison of those models. Specific problems to be studied include wave \r\npropagation in bulk materials, static granular piles, multiphase models \r\nfor fine powders and multidimensional granular flows.  In all those \r\nproblems, dry friction plays a central role. Depending on the problem \r\nand its formulation, the presence of frictional effects manifests itself \r\nmathematically in various ways: presence of a graph, stiff source term \r\nin systems of balance laws, algebraic constraints. Each of those \r\ndifficulties leads to new numerical challenges. The wide variety of \r\nmathematical problems resulting from the modelization of the above \r\nphenomena (differential inclusion, systems of conservation laws, balance \r\nlaws, Hamilton-Jacobi equations, elliptic and parabolic problems, \r\nnon-local free boundary problems) is a testimony to the incredible \r\nrichness of this field.\r\n\r\nIn countless industries, materials have to be processed, stored and \r\nretrieved in granular form. Surprisingly many problems occur during \r\nthose various phases. Difficulties range from the complete structural \r\ncollapse of silos during discharge to poor performance and \r\nunpredictability of the manufacturing process. This comes at a very high \r\nfinancial cost to solid processing plants. It is proposed to design and \r\nimplement, in consultation with engineers from both Academia and \r\nIndustry, numerical methods that allow for the calculations of granular \r\nflows and related problems in general geometries. The current methods in \r\nuse date back to the 1950's and have  limited predicitive capabilities.\r\n\r\n",
