 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study involves addition of specific free tropospheric processes to the EPA's CMAQ (Community Multi-scale Air Quality) model, and examination of their impact on free tropospheric chemistry, and subsequent influence on boundary layer ozone.  These processes include stratosphere-troposphere exchange, planetary boundary layer - free troposphere exchange, and production of reactive nitrogen (NOx) from lightning.  These model additions will make significant use of available in situ and remote observational data, and global model results.  The CMAQ model is widely used in the community, but is known to perform poorly in simulations of the free troposphere.  The goal of this project is to improve that situation.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include the support of a graduate student and two post-doctoral fellows, and likely improvement of well-used models for tropospheric chemistry research and air quality management.  These model improvements will allow better assessment of the effectiveness of US air quality policies, and more reliable testing of alternative air pollution control scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis project involves significant synergism with activities sponsored by other agencies.  In addition to the 3 senior scientists, 2 post-doctoral fellows and graduate student from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and the senior scientist and graduate student from the University of Nevada Las Vegas sponsored in this project, there will be coordination with 2 senior scientists from NASA, a senior scientist from NCAR, and several senior scientists from EPA.",
