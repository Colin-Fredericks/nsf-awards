 "awd_abstract_narration": "AIID/Hats: An Architecture for Interpreting Intelligence Data\r\nPaul Cohen, Center for Research on Unexpected Events, USC Information Sciences Institute.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will demonstrate how the new technology of Bayesian blackboards scales to problems involving ambiguous and incomplete data about thousands of individuals. \r\nThe Center for Research on Unexpected Events (CRUE) has developed a prototype of a Bayesian blackboard system called AIID, Architecture for the Interpretation of Intelligence Data.  A Bayesian blackboard combines the technologies of blackboard systems and Bayesian belief networks. One consequence of this marriage is that the control of intelligence gathering in the world and inference on the blackboard can be rational, that is, grounded in probability and utility theory.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this project is a simulator of terrorist activities called Hats. The simulator is home to thousands of agents (\"hats\"), which travel to meetings. Some hats are covert terrorists and a very few hats are known terrorists. All hats are governed by plans generated by a planner. Terrorist plans end in the destruction of landmarks. The object of a game against the Hats simulator is to find terrorist task forces before they carry out their plans. One pays for information about hats, and also for false arrests and destroyed landmarks. At the end of a game, one is given a score, which is the sum of these costs. The goal is to play Hats rationally, that is, to catch terrorist groups with the least combined cost of information, false arrests, and destroyed landmarks.\r\n\r\nThe Bayesian blackboard is a marriage of the best knowledge-based information fusion architecture and the best methods to organize and reason with probabilistic hypotheses.\r\nThe Bayesian blackboard, because it gives a sound probabilistic semantics to hypotheses, enables a theory of rational intelligence analysis, or, equivalently, the development of mathematical formulations of the utility of intelligence and action against suspects.\r\n\r\nThis project is part of an effort by the Center for Research on Unexpected Events (CRUE) at USC's Information Sciences Institute to develop tools for rational intelligence analysis. CRUE's scientific focus is mathematical and simulation models which unify apparently diverse activities such as intrusion detection and biosurveillance. Taken together these models constitute a new field called informatics for urban security. These models will be tested in the AIID/Hats system, and AIID will be developed as a tool for intelligence analysts. The current proposal, and all CRUE efforts, serve the intelligence community; in this instance through the KD-D program.\r\n",
