 "awd_abstract_narration": "Norfolk State University, in partnership with Elizabeth City State University, will offer a 10-week collaborative research program for a total of twelve (12) undergraduate students. The goal of this REU site is to expose students to basic research through projects that explore various areas of environmental biology. This collaborative venture will offer opportunities for exceptional undergraduate students, primarily at the sophomore or junior level; however, students who have completed the freshman year and have shown outstanding promise and commitment to research will also be encouraged to participate to gain experience conducting research projects.  Student research fellows will experience a program with a broad emphasis in environmental biology and chemistry.  They will participate in active research including bioremediation, molecular biology and gene expression, water quality and meteorological effects on habitats, and environmental chemistry.  Students will be assigned to specific faculty mentors for the summer.  They will be awarded stipends and on-campus housing and board at the respective sites.  In addition to the research program, undergraduate summer research fellows will participate in a variety of seminars, weekly meetings and social functions.  \r\n\r\nThe program will bring together an interdisciplinary team from two Schools of Science at two historically black colleges and universities.  The result will be two model sites that will boost minority achievement and increase significantly minority representation in the environmental sciences.  This will occur principally through supervised hands-on laboratory and field research activities to stimulate student interest and illustrate science concepts via hypothesis driven research. -- Information and dissemination of program activities will be via the Norfolk State University School of Science and Technology web page (http://sst.nsu.edu/bioreu.htm). For more information, contact Dr. Camellia Moses Okpodu at cmokpodu@nsu.edu) or Kathlene Fischer at kmfischer@mail.ecsu.edu.\r\n\r\n",
