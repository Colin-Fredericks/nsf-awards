The effort combines mature, off-the-shelf RF transmission components; an open-source software radio development methodology based on experience with commercial software radio architectures; a novel, low-cost commercial phase array antenna system; novel waveforms designed for ease of experimentation; and an integrated simulation and deployment system based on widely-used open source software.  Although individual components of the system can be customized by individual research groups, the resulting system is planned to operate in the 2.4GHz ISM-band spectrum.  \r\nThe project is also establishing a small testbed for development and testing, although the focus is on developing a kit to be replicated at different institutions.  The use of commercially available RF components and development environments reduces the cost of the deployed systems, and insures that other researchers can easily acquire the equipment needed to develop their own testbeds. \r\nThis research is developing a platform for experimentation in many different aspects of programmable wireless networks, allowing other researchers to focus on software, algorithms and policies for such systems.  The project is also developing novel media access protocols and RF predistortion methods appropriate for exploiting phased-array antennas.  These efforts will improve the utility of the system to others who wish to exploit the phased-array antenna.\r\n",
