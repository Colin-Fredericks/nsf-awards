The embedded high-performance computation module based on System on Programmable Chip (SoPC) technology will allow onboard sensor processing, advanced kinematic control, reliable communication, and real-time adaptation of the system to its environment enabling research in a wide variety of tasks in urban search and rescue, civilian and military surveillance, and planetary exploration. \r\n\r\nCurrent approaches to miniature robotics using proxy-processing schemes over unreliable communication channels have demonstrated the significance and importance of the research challenges, but lead to inefficient research production. This proposal focuses on a computational node for robotic instruments at the centimeter scale to fill a technically significant gap in available instrumentation. The resulting computation module will have broad applicability to distributed robotic systems for other researchers and educators. In addition, the research will directly result in robotics tools for use in urban search and rescue, and surveillance. The instrument will also enable pure research in ad hoc wireless networking and distributed sensor networks, as well as robotics, which are areas of great commercial importance. From the standpoints of education and diversity, this system will act as an attractor, bringing the under-represented students at CCNY (which ranks as one of the most diversified campuses in the U.S., with about 1/3 Hispanic and 1/3 Black) both to the instrument development activities and to the engineering classes this instrumentation will enhance. \r\n",
