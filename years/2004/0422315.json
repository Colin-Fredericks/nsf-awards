 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides scholarships for academically talented, financially needy students, with an emphasis on attracting women and underrepresented minorities. It provides 85 scholarships over four years while implementing a plan to increase the candidate pool. The project includes three faculty members from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, as well as the Director of Enrollment Services & Financial Aid, Assistant Director of Enrollment Services, Executive Director of Student Services, and Program Manager of Career Services. Recruitment will include outreach to specialized organizations such as Women in Science and Engineering, the Urban League, and the Hispanic organization, Adelante. Every CSEMS scholar will be paired with a faculty mentor who will direct academic and personal interventions as necessary. Academically challenged students will be offered extended classroom instruction or individual tutoring. Eligible students will be offered Dowling College matching grants, opportunities for work-study and co-op/internships.\r\nIntellectual merit: the project will advance knowledge and understanding of computer science and mathematics in local school communities and industry.\r\nBroader impacts: the project will make an important contribution to understanding how to create a collegiate learning environment in which underrepresented students can fulfill career goals.",
