 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research project is to experimentally demonstrate a mechanically-controllable single-electron transistor which is resolved by Coulomb blockade. The approach consists of a set of activities involving: (1) developing a nanoscale AlGaAs/InGaAs beam resonator with an electrically isolated metallic quantum dot at the end and a two dimensional electron gas embedded in the beam by utilizing a series of processing technologies including electron beam lithography, wet and dry etching, metallization and deposition; (2) investigating the beam resonant excitation capacitively coupled by high frequency AC signals and enhanced by piezoelectric effects; (3) demonstrating Coulomb blockade on the fabricated electromechanical single electron transistors at the GHz frequency range using improved RF testing technologies. \r\nThe proposed nanomechanical electron shuttle devices promise to be extremely fast and ultrahighly sensitive devices for sensor and communication applications and are ideal candidates for fundamental research in electron-phonon coupling in nanoelectromechnical systems. This new class of nanoelectromechanical devices will allow quantum limited displacement sensing, as well as charge and mass detection. The devices will provide a revolution in applications in future communications, quantum computers, precision measurement and standard, and DNA decoding. Moreover, the interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research offers graduate and undergraduate students a great training opportunity in nanostructure processing, device testing at RF and microwave frequencies, and quantum mechanics-based theoretical modeling and simulation. Research findings and discoveries will be incorporated into the principle investigator's course, \"Nano-scale Structures and Devices\" to improve and enrich the course.\r\n",
