 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research  Phase I research project will demonstrate the feasibility of a light source for a portable and wearable near infrared, multi-wavelength spectroscopy unit. This will enable portable, non-invasive blood spectroscopy by the displacement of tungsten filament based light sources with compact, efficient light sources based on semiconductor lasers. A laser technology platform that is scalable in a cost effective manner to access the clinically relevant 1350nm to 2450nm wavelength range, which includes an optimal fingerprint range for the sensing of blood ethanol, urea or glucose, will be demonstrated. This will result in a robust and efficient light source / spectroscopy platform that will enable dramatic performance improvements and size reductions in systems for optically based non-invasive monitoring of human health.\r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project will in the management and treatment of diabetes. Diabetes is a disease that affects millions of Americans. It is well known that much of the chronic damage from this disease results from inadequate monitoring of blood sugar levels over time. A robust strategy for real time monitoring and intervention in glucose level variation will have a revolutionary impact on the quality of life for these millions, and millions more worldwide. \r\n",
