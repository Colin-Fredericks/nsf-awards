 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a Science and Technology Studies dissertation improvement grant.  The researcher will study science policy surrounding Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE), a devastating and biologically unique form of infectious disease, many of whose properties remain uncertain or unknown. Funds from the grant will support travel, room and board expenses, as well as some expenses fro equipment.  In both the U.S. and U.K., scientific researchers are in the process of attempting to understand TSE and produce strategies and tools to help protect the population.  The goal of the project is to test the hypothesis that representations of risk and uncertainty, as well as the instruments and methods that produce them, serve as key devices for maintaining exchange relationships while at the same time preserving the boundaries between these two domains. In both the U.S. and U.K., the researcher will interview scientific researchers and conduct participant- observation field work, analyze the historical and scientific literature, observe TSE advisory committee meetings, interview committee members, and analyze transcripts, correspondences, and media coverage related to the events. All data will be managed with NUDIST text-coding-retrieval software and analyzed using the qualitative methodology of grounded theory. The project has broad implications both in relation to TSE specifically, and in relation to all matters that concern the health of the population and involve substantial scientific uncertainty. Issues related to TSE include the safety of the blood supply, the food supply, and surgical intervention. This study will offer valuable insight into the process through which these risks are managed - both scientifically and governmentally.",
