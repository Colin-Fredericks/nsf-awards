 "awd_abstract_narration": "The availability of genome sequence for an increasing number of microorganisms is resulting in a revolution in biology and enabling biologists to study global responses of microorganisms to a variety of factors, including changing external environment, signaling molecules, and the lateral transfer of genetic information from their neighbors.  Technologies for measuring global gene expression and the entire cellular protein\r\ncomplement&#8212;or proteome&#8212;in addition to other novel, high-throughput measurements, are increasingly being applied to sequenced microorganisms as part of functional genomics research efforts. The results from these technologies, when analyzed and integrated into computational models, are revealing complex regulatory and metabolic networks in cells and the functions of previously uncharacterized genes and signal transduction pathways. As this research evolves and new technologies are developed, further insights into the function of microbial populations and communities will be gained and will serve as a basis for functional predictions from genome sequences. Although these technologies offer great promise for biology research, there are also important limitations and opportunities for further developments that must be recognized by end users.This colloquium, convened by the American Academy of Microbiology (AAM), will pick up where the 2000 AAM report, &#8220;Microbial Genomes: Blueprints for Life, &#8221; * left off. The focus of this colloquium will be on how to capitalize scientifically on the advances in microbial genomics and progress towards a functional understanding of individual microorganisms and microbial communities. We plan to convene this colloquium June 4-6, 2004, in Portland, Oregon. Colloquium participants will discuss where the field is heading and identify scientific opportunities, challenges, and benefits of this research. An important aspect will be the identification of resource and technology gaps that must be addressed in order to advance the field. The results of the colloquium will be published in a report&#8212; widely disseminated&#8212;that will be of interest to a diverse audience, including the scientific community, funding agencies, and educators.A group of 35-40 scientists will be invited to participate in this colloquium. The American Academy of Microbiology will provide travel support for the participants, including airfare, ground transportation, on-site lodging and meals, and other expenses related to attendance. The funds are being sought from federal agencies, international groups, foundations, and the corporate sector to offset these expenses.",
