 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund an Academic Employment Initiative by the American Chemical Society.  The pilot project is aimed at broadening the process which colleges and universities recruit faculty in the chemical sciences.  The intent is to give colleges and universities exposure to a larger pool of candidates for faculty positions than is possible through current recruitment practices, and to give candidates the opportunity to convey their teaching and research goals to a wider audience.  The initial phase will cover a two-year period of programming at each of four national meetings of the American Chemical Society.  It will begin with a Presidential Event Symposium at the March 2004 ACS meeting in Anaheim on \"Recruiting Faculty\".   Workshops will be developed for prospective faculty applicants and held at these meetings.  Poster sessions involving the faculty candidates will be held to allow facile candidate-recruiter interactions.  The goal is to create a more inclusive system of faculty recruiting that will ultimately strengthen research and teaching in the chemical sciences.   Assessment will include input from both faculty candidates and chemistry departments, ACS committees and co-sponsoring organizations.  This award is co-funded by the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities/Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate.",
