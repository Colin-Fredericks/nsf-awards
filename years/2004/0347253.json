 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at William Marsh Rice University focuses on electronic transport at the molecular-scale, integrated with education and outreach efforts.  Single-molecule transistors (SMTs) are novel, unique tools for examining conduction through individual molecular states.  Relevant physics includes charge transfer at molecule-metal interfaces, quantum coherence, disorder effects, vibrational excitations, Coulomb blockade, and many-body correlations.  This rich palette allows this\r\nproject to address fundamental scientific issues in condensed matter at the molecular scale, and to provide a knowledge base for possible future molecular electronic technologies.  Investigations include: effects of work function and metal-molecule binding; origins of nonlinear conduction in two-terminal molecular devices; molecules coupled to correlated electrodes; and quantum impurity problems.  This project provides state-of-the-art research training in nanoscience.  The PI is also developing new coursework related to this research that will reinvigorate the undergraduate Applied Physics version of the physics major.  By leveraging existing outreach programs, this research also reaches a broad audience, including high school\r\nteachers, their students, and traditionally underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nTransistors made from single small molecules are the ultimate limit of scaling of active electronic devices.  This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at William Marsh Rice University focuses\r\non using such systems to examine electrical conduction at the molecular scale.  These investigations are integrated with education and outreach efforts.  Single-molecule transistor experiments are at the interface between physics, chemistry, and electrical engineering. The tremendous variety of available molecules allows experiments to examine diverse topics ranging from metal-molecule charge transfer to \"quantum impurity\" problems with adjustable interactions between a single atom and many electrons.  The goal is an understanding of the basic physics of charge flow at the nanometer scale, while simultaneously providing a knowledge base for possible future molecular electronic technologies such as sensors.  This project\r\nprovides state-of-the-art research training in nanoscience.  The PI is also developing new coursework related to this research that will reinvigorate the undergraduate Applied Physics version of the physics\r\nmajor.  By leveraging existing outreach programs, this research also reaches a broad audience, including high school teachers, their students, and traditionally underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\n",
