 "awd_abstract_narration": "The advent of computers is routinely bringing large, \r\nvery large datasets for analysis.  How to analyze the\r\nattendant data and/or how to glean useful information \r\nfrom these data is anything but routine. This proposal \r\ninvestigates two broad areas, viz., mixture decomposition, \r\nand regression in the presence of taxonomy and hierarchical \r\nvariables.  The mixture decomposition work is concerned with \r\ndata in which the observation is a distribution function \r\nin the p-dimensional Cartesian product of distributions space,\r\n rather than the single point in p-dimensional space of \r\nclassical data.  Such data arise naturally, or after a\r\nggregation of original data to a more manageable size \r\nyet retaining its inherent information. A goal is to \r\npartition these distributions into coherent classes \r\nand to estimate the relevant class distributions.  \r\nIt is proposed to adapt ideas from copula theory for \r\nclassical data, to data comprised of distributions.  \r\nEmbedded in this process is the need to study parameter \r\nestimation.  Different partitioning techniques will be \r\nexplored such as dynamical clustering, different measures \r\nof fit criterion will be considered, e.g., log-likelihood \r\nclassification; and different estimation methods explored \r\nfor the underlying copulas and the associated distributions \r\nand their parameters, e.g., maximum likelihood, nonparametric \r\nmethods such as Parzen's truncated window.  The resulting \r\nmethodology will have wide applicability to those datasets \r\ngenerated in, e.g., meteorology, environmental science, \r\nsocial sciences, health-care programs, and the like.  \r\nRegression methods when taxonomy variables, and when \r\nhierarchical variables, are present will also be developed.  \r\nThis will first be executed for classical data, and then \r\nextended to interval-valued data and to histogram- \r\n(or frequency-) valued data.\r\n\r\nWith modern computers generating very large datasets, it is imperative\r\nthat techniques be developed for analysing such datasets. To date very\r\nfew methods exist. The research will develop new methodologies for\r\nanalysing these data. A first step is to aggregate the data in some\r\nwell-defined but meaningful way. This aggregation will thence produce\r\ndata in the form of lists, intervals, or distributions, and these data\r\nwill now have some form of internal structure. The research will focus\r\non such data of two types. One will be where the data now consist of\r\ndistributions, and where the goal is to develop methods to identify the\r\nappropraite mixture of distributions that describe these data. Another\r\ndeals with taxonomy and hierarical data, with the goal of establishing\r\nregression relationships that will explain the underlying process\r\ngoverning the variables involved. The resulting methodologies will\r\nallow analysis and interpretation of contemporary datastes where\r\ncurrently no methods exist.  \r\n",
