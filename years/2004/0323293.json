This project is collaborative with another such request from Coastal Carolina University (CCU; EAR-0323338).  Together, the funds will provide for two different but complementary GPR systems for local and regional geoscience research and education projects that require high resolution imaging of the near subsurface.   The equipment will provide for hands educational experiences for undergraduates at CCU and both undergraduate and graduates students at USC and the two-unit pool will be available for sharing by either institutional faculty members when not otherwise subscribed.   The instruments will support a range of basic research by early career faculty at these two institutions including studies in barrier beach evolution and dynamics, geoarchaeology and paleontology, paleoseismology and environmental geology. \r\n***\r\n\r\n",
