 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2004 Gordon Conference on Catalysis  will be held on June 27-July 2, 2004 at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire.  The conference will focus on several areas that are key to the fundamental understanding of catalytic chemistry and engineering.  The development of more efficient selective oxidation catalysts and the role of catalysis in the production and utilization of hydrogen as a source of transportable energy will also be emphasized. Leading researchers will discuss:  advances in molecular level characterization of catalysts under in situ conditions, quantitative descriptions of reaction pathways, catalytic selectivity (especially for oxidation), advanced fuel cell catalysis, and model or novel catalytic processes.  The themes and speakers are of interest to both academic and industrial communities.  Current and future trends in heterogeneous catalysis will be the general theme.  This grant will provide partial support for speakers, graduate students, post-doctoral students, and younger faculty.  This support will permit a more comprehensive discussion and dissemination of the material.",
