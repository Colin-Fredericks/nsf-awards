 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced cement-polymer composite has been an active research area for decades. By adding polymeric materials in cements, the inorganic particles can be strongly bonded together through the polymer matrix, and as a result the tensile strength, which is usually\r\nthe weakest aspect of cements, is increased by order of magnitude. Based on the intercalation and exfoliation techniques developed recently in the research on polymer-silicate nanocomposites, it is now possible to reinforce cements by using polymers of high thermal/moisture resistance and cost efficiency, and keeps the processing condition similar to that of ordinary precast concrete segments. Preliminary research has shown encouraging results. The intercalation of the polymer chains between the interlayer of inorganic particles could be achieved under mild conditions with the ihby-productlc of the exfoliation of the silicate nanolayers. The PIEC will be stronger than the MDF cements and at least as durable as the ordinary cements, and offer an excellent cost-performance balance. Materials characterization and computer simulations will also be carried out to provide a scientific basis for optimizing the processing parameters.\r\n\r\nThrough the proposed research we will develop the high-performance PIEC, which will\r\npromote the application of precasting techniques and impact various aspects of construction industry, such as structure design, construction procedures, maintenance and repair techniques, and so on. It will be immensely beneficial to the economy due to the considerable reduction in the costs of materials, transportation, handling, placing, as well as the environment and energy conservation. The developed PIEC and testing devices will be used in a number of undergraduate and graduate courses, as well as a series of seminars, which will have significant impacts on the curriculum of the Department of Civil Engineering. Female students and under-represented minorities will be particularly encouraged to attend these seminars and courses. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be actively involved in this project and acquire comprehensive experiences. Exhibits of the results will be organized in local museums and libraries to enhance the exposure of engineering research to the public. This, together with the development of a web-based virtue museum of advanced cement-polymer composites, will be very helpful for high school students and freshmen to maintain interests in engineering fields in the early stage of their career path.\r\n\r\n",
