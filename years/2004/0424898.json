 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research pertains to the determination of gene function of the calcium/calmodulin-mediated transcriptional networks involved in stress signaling in Arabidopsis.  The calcium messenger system plays a critical role in the perception and transduction of external and internal stimuli.  Calmodulin (CaM), a primary intracellular calcium receptor, transduces calcium signals by binding to and altering the activity of the target proteins.  Genome-wide screening with CaM has revealed that Arabidopsis has at least 12 signal-responsive CaM-binding transcription factors (CaMBTFs).  The goal of this research is to study the in planta functional significance of the CaMBTFs using a collaborative approach involving scientists from Washington State University, Purdue University and Colorado State University.  These investigators share a common interest in studying calcium/CaM-mediated signaling and its role in plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses.  It is hypothesized that calcium/CaM plays an important role in plant response to biotic and abiotic stresses by regulating CaMBTFs.  Specific goals are:  (1) The functional significance of CaMBTFs using loss-of-function genetic approaches; (2) The functional analysis of CaMBTFs using gain-of-function as well as site-directed mutants in the calmodulin-binding domain; and (3) Identify the cis-elements and downstream target genes.  A better understanding of the function(s) of these CaMBTFs will increase our knowledge of how plants respond to biotic and abiotic stresses, and help in the production of improved crop plants.  Another aspect of this project includes integrating these findings into the broader educational arena.  Apart from training undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs, this project will also involve high school science teachers and their students.  The project data will be publicly available and the mutant seeds will be deposited at the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center.\r\n\r\n",
