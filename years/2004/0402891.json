 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 03-043, category NIRT: Nanoscale Structures, Novel Phenomena, and Quantum Control.  This award to University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) is to study nanostructured metalloceramic materials that show a seamless transition from a nanostructured bulk metal to a nanostructured ceramic surface.   With this award, Professor Vohra and his team consisting of physicists, biomaterial and biomedical engineers, cell biologist and an industrial partner will develop wear-resistant and cell friendly biomaterials coatings for use in orthopedic implants, which would benefit from having a metallic core along with ultra-hard and smooth nanostructured ceramic articulating surfaces.  The fundamental understanding of materials science, mechanical wear behavior and cell biology of nanostructured metalloceramic biomaterials would be an outcome of this award, and these studies may lead to better performance of these materials in the human body. There will be three primary thrust areas with this award:  1) develop processing science and technology for reducing friction and wear on the articulating, load-bearing components of total hip and knee metallic implants by depositing various ternary (Titanium-Boron Nitride and Boron-Carbon Nitride) nanostructured functionally graded metalloceramic coatings with hardness greater than 50 Giga Pascal; 2) demonstrate enhanced adhesion, wear resistance, and surface hardness of these coatings over the current state-of-the-art materials; and 3) perform in vitro studies to compare the adhesion and osteoblastic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells on the nanostructured metalloceramic surfaces with standard micron-scale hydroxyapatite and titanium. A leading manufacturer of biomedical implants will evaluate the nanostructured functionally graded metalloceramic materials developed by this award. \r\n\r\nThe award will help to provide an innovative nanotechnology workforce development program with core courses and workshops in nanostructured biomaterials, interaction of cells with biomaterials surfaces and commercialization of nanotechnology tools and materials.  The graduate students supported by this award will have a semester-long internship at industry. A Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program in nanoscale science and its applications will be implemented with active participation of underrepresented minority teachers.\r\n\r\nThe Division of Materials Research in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Directorate for Engineering jointly fund this award.",
