 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor James Coe of Ohio State University is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to develop a fundamental understanding of the extraordinary transmission effect seen in metal microarrays. First seen by Ebessen's group in the visible wavelength range, the effect can also be seen in the infrared (as shown by the PI) by employing arrays with appropriate dimensions. In addition, stacked arrays are being studied as a way of coupling infrared spectroscopy with electrochemical/capacitance measurements, an important application for sensors. The ability of the metal micro-arrays to record high sensitivity infrared absorbance spectra of surfaces is also being exploited by the Coe group. A variety of systems are under study, including alkane thiol monolayers, phospholipid bilayers, DNA and membrane bound proteins. The questions of interest are phase transitions in the monolayers and bilayers and the orientation of membrane-bound proteins. \r\n\r\nThe observation of extraordinary transmission in the infrared is novel, and for applications such as sensors, the infrared spectral region is much more promising than the visible-ultraviolet region because of the unique fingerprint of molecules in the infrared.  Thus, in the long run, these devices might serve as the sensor in combinatorial or arrayed techniques for the rapid, sensitive and molecule-specific detection of nanotech constructions, DNA and membrane-bound species.  Students working in this are are exposed to combinations of physical chemistry, bioanalysis as well as surface physics.\r\n\r\n",
