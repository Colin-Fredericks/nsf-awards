 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose to explore a novel biologically inspired power supply that has both a high power density and a small package size. The micro flagellar motor dynamo or FMD is a microscale hybrid system fabricated from MEMS devices and a non-pathogenic, genetically engineered strain of Escherichia coli (KAF95) flagellar motor. This\r\nflagellar motor is a nanoscale molecular motor capable of a large rotary torque and high power output (relative to other molecular motors). When tethered down to a microfabricated surface, the motor turns at a stable rotational rate, providing a natural mechanical power generator. The FMD converts this mechanical power into an electrical one by combining the flagellar motor with a copper microcoil and micro ferromagnetic beads. With the ferromagnetic beads attached, the tethered motor generates a rotating magnetic field that induces a voltage in the stationary microcoil due to Faraday's Law. Based on a preliminary study, this induced voltage can potentially provide the same power density level as that of a methanol fuel cell.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of Proposed Activity\r\nThe proposed project is an important step towards the development of an effective electrical power supply for current and future MEMS and NEMS. It uniquely combines the technologies in microbiology and microfabrication to design and fabricate a hybrid biological/artificial power system that is both compact and efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of Proposed Activity\r\nThe proposed project will generate significant educational opportunities for students at both the college and K-12 levels. The UA graduate and undergraduate students supported under this effort will benefit greatly from diversified experience in microbiology and microfabrication. The K-12 students and teachers recruited for the project will become more aware of MEMS and microbiology, which can lead to more K-12 students pursuing science and engineering as a career path. The PI will actively recruit underrepresented students through his current role as a mentor for women and minority engineering students. He will also expand his activities in NSF-RET programs to involve more minority K-12 teachers.\r\n",
