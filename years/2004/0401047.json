The Groebner fan of an ideal or\r\nmodule is the decomposition of the space of weight vectors that induce\r\nGroebner base, such that each cone in the fan indexes a distinct\r\nGroebner basis. This project describes four problems from\r\ncombinatorics, optimization, representation theory and algebraic\r\ngeometry that revolve around Groebner fans. The first project\r\ninvestigates the complexity, geometry and homological properties of\r\ninitial ideals of toric ideals. Answers to these questions have\r\nimplications in integer programming and on the computation of toric\r\nGroebner bases which themselves have several applications. The next \r\nexamines the variation of weight vectors in Kalai's theory of\r\nalgebraic shifting for simplicial complexes.  The third project\r\nstudies the polyhedral geometry of moduli of resentations of the McKay\r\nquiver which (partially) resolve singularities that arise in\r\ngeneralized McKay correspondence. The last goal is to develop a\r\nsoftware package for computing Groebner fans of arbitrary polynomial\r\nideals.  Applications include the computation of tropical varieties and\r\nthe study of orbit closures and degenerations of representations of\r\nfinite dimensional algebras.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work will employ tools from combinatorics, discrete\r\ngeometry and optimization to solve problems from commutative algebra,\r\nrepresentation theory and algebraic geometry.  All projects have a\r\nstrong computational component that aims at effective algorithms and\r\nserves as a laboratory for uncovering new structure theorems. The\r\ncollaborations include three graduate students and three current or\r\nrecent postdocs.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
