 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal will support the yearly workshop and conference of Digital Government Research Program grantees, along with their government partners, students, and other interested individuals. Based on past experience, there will be an attendance of about 200 individuals. A white-paper submission and process will be supported, as well as several events for student demonstrations. In addition, the proposal will support several outreach activities; these include a web site (www.digitalgovernment.org) and a printed brochure covering highlights of the DG program. The workshop will serve several purposes: \r\n\r\nTo allow grantees and their gov't partners to become aware of what other grantee/agency teams are doing, \r\nTo provide a forum for government agencies to present their IT-related problems and challenges, and \r\nTo support much-needed dialog between social/political science grantees and technical grantees. \r\n",
