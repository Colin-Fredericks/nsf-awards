Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES)\r\ninitiated\r\nby the US National Science Foundation (NSF) in late 1999 is intended to transform the\r\nnation.s ability to carry out earthquake engineering research. With over $80 million in\r\nnew\r\ncutting-edge tools for experimentation, networking, data curation and communication,\r\nthe\r\nbest minds in earthquake engineering will be able to challenge and solve the most\r\ndifficult\r\nimpediments to reducing the nation's vulnerability to earthquakes. To accelerate\r\nattainment\r\nof NEES's goals, and avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, US investigators need to\r\ncollaborate and have access to data and facilities internationally.\r\nA major long-term, research initiative has begun in Japan known as .E-Defense.. This\r\ninitiative is managed by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster\r\nPrevention (NIED) on behalf of the Japan Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports,\r\nScience\r\nand Technology (MExT). A key component of this initiative is a new, large (20 by 15 m)\r\nshaking table capable of subjecting full-scale, five-story tall, specimens to\r\nthree-dimensional\r\nseismic excitations larger than those experienced in the devastating 1995 Hyogo-ken\r\nNanbu\r\nearthquake. In addition, a long-term research program using this shaking table and\r\nother\r\nmajor facilities for experimentation and computer-based simulation is planned. This\r\nprogram\r\ncalls for a strong, but as yet undefined, component of international collaboration.\r\nAs such, a Planning Meeting is being convened in Shin-Kobe, Japan, near the\r\nE-Defense\r\nshaking table facility, during April 6-8, 2004 to discuss opportunities for collaboration\r\nbetween the NEES and E-Defense. A small, but diverse group of representative\r\nresearchers\r\nfrom the US and Japan are meeting, along with representatives from NIED, MExT, NSF,\r\nthe\r\nNEES Consortium, Inc. (NCI), to identify research topics of mutual interest that fully take\r\nadvantage of the unique capabilities of the E-Defense facilities, mechanisms for\r\ndeveloping\r\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nProposal Abstract\r\nProposal:0431490 PI Name:Buckle, Ian\r\nPrinted from eJacket: 08/10/04 Page 1 of 2\r\nresearch plans and projects, and steps needed to implement NEESgrid and related\r\nservices\r\nwithin E-Defense so that the full potential of collaboration between those involved in the\r\nNEES Collaboratory and E-Defense can be realized. The findings of the meeting are\r\nbeing\r\ndistributed widely to potential sponsors and researchers in Japan and in the US.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The E-Defense program in Japan provides truly phenomenal\r\nopportunities for discovery and innovation not possible within the current NEES\r\nportfolio.\r\nBy leveraging US and Japanese resources through focused collaborative effort, it is\r\npossible\r\nto accelerate the pace of discovery and innovation needed to mitigate catastrophic\r\nlosses due\r\nto large earthquakes. NEES/E-Defense is expected to provide the overall US\r\nearthquake\r\nengineering community access to rich sets of data.\r\nBroader impacts resulting from proposed activity: Explicit NEES/E-Defense\r\ncollaboration will provide heightened opportunities for international cooperation. These\r\ninclude conduct of collaborative research projects, sharing of unique research\r\nresources,\r\ndevelopment of international standards and capabilities for documenting, archiving and\r\nsharing information, and exchange of personnel. Participants in NEES/E-Defense\r\nprojects\r\nare expected to include junior researchers, women and members of underrepresented\r\ngroups,\r\nas well as senior members, of the earthquake engineering and IT research communities\r\nNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION\r\nProposal Abstract\r\nProposal:0431490 PI Name:Buckle, Ian",
