Leavens\r\n\r\nThis project will advance the theory and practice of aspect-oriented software development.  Aspect-oriented languages allow  modularization of code for requirements that do not align with a program's architecture, reducing scattering and tangling of code for these cross-cutting requirements.\r\n\r\nThe problem addressed by this project is how to recover static, modular reasoning in aspect-oriented programs.  The technical approach is to create the design discipline, based on an analogy to behavioral subtyping, and a small aspect-oriented programming language to support it.  By producing prototype tools and\r\napplying them in case studies, the researchers will experimentally validate the utility of the language and design discipline.  A formal study of specification and verification techniques will demonstrate\r\nsoundness of static, modular reasoning in the language and design discipline.\r\n\r\nThe discipline developed through the project will benefit software engineers and programmers by providing guidance for thinking about and applying aspect-oriented programming techniques.  The discipline may\r\nalso improve software correctness and maintainability.  By showing how a language can support the discipline, the project will contribute to the design of programming and specification languages.  Like the\r\nnotion of behavioral subtyping, a disciplined approach to thinking about aspect-oriented abstraction will help educators convey the key ideas of the paradigm.\r\n",
