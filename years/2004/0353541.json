 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Viktor V. Zhdankin, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota, Duluth, is exploring the chemistry of hypervalent compounds of iodine and bismuth. His studies include the preparation and structural characterization of new classes of hypervalent iodine- and bismuth-containing heterocycles, the evaluation of synthetic approaches to organic derivatives of heptavalent iodine, and the development of new synthetic methodologies based on hypervalent iodine complexes, iodine heterocycles, amino acid-derived hypervalent iodine dicarboxylates, and phosphorane-derived iodanes.\r\n\r\nWith this Research in Undergraduate Institutions award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is providing renewed support for the research efforts of Professor Viktor V. Zhdankin, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Minnesota, Duluth. Through the study of new structural types of compounds containing iodine or bismuth, Professor Zhdankin will enhance our understanding of the structure and reactivity of these unusual compounds, develop new reagents and procedures for organic synthesis, and search for new compounds with unusual and useful properties. These studies will be carried out primarily by undergraduate students from the University of Minnesota, Duluth.",
