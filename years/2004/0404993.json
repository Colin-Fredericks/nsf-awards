 "awd_abstract_narration": "Massive stars are born in clusters within giant molecular clouds, regions which contain substantial concentrations of interstellar gas and dust. This cloud material is gravitationally accreting onto the growing stellar embryo, as well as being modified by the radiation and wind of the newly forming luminous hot stars and nearby cluster constituents. The stars are often hidden from view behind extensive local and line of sight dust absorption. This research is utilizing infra-red wavelengths to study these hot stars from the time their ionization of the local birth environment first makes itself known until the time when the remnant dusty natal material has been fully shed. A radio selected sample of giant molecular cloud regions is the source for the identification, classification, and analysis of their stellar members with near infrared photometry,  infrared spectroscopy, and other measures of dust emission in the mid IR and the radio  wavelengths. The overall thrust of the project is to investigate massive star birth during the initial stages of evolution. It will have an impact on birth processes going on in our Galaxy and in nearby and more distant starburst galaxies, and will help us understand the initial stages of massive star formation during the very early history of the Universe.",
