 "awd_abstract_narration": "The CUNY AGEP Program, MAGNET-STEM, was launched in 1999 to produce a significant \r\nnumber of underrepresented minority doctoral students in science and engineering fields and to \r\nprepare  them  for  academic  careers. The  major  goal  of  this  project, MAGNET-STEM  II,  is  to \r\nbuild  on  previous  gains  and  institutionalize  effective  practices  by  strengthening  the  alliance's \r\nundergraduate-to-graduate- to- post graduate infrastructure. This goal is in accord with the NSF \r\npriority  to  \"catalyze  changes  in  institutional,  departmental  and  organizational  culture  and \r\npractices that will result in significant increases in the recruitment, retention, degree conferral and \r\nSTEM career (especially academic) entry of minority students.\" Activities will include:  \r\n(1)  undergraduate  /graduate  summer  research  and  internships;  (2)  mentoring  and  mentoring \r\ntraining;  (3)  conference  presentations;  (4)  colloquia  and  seminars    on  teaching,  science  and \r\nmathematics education, and on communication technologies. MAGNET-STEM II will comprise \r\nan inclusive scholarly community of STEM faculty and students from diverse ethnic, racial, and \r\ngeographic backgrounds, as well as persons with disabilities. Students will be guided by experts \r\nin their scientific field to engage in research activities that enable them to master the knowledge \r\nand investigative approaches in their chosen areas of specialization. The project will promote the \r\nsocial  as  well  as  academic  integration  of  all  AGEP  students  within  departments  and  the \r\nimprovement  of  advisement,  in  addition  to  offering  financial  support.  Informal  and  formal \r\ninteraction between faculty and students to socialize AGEP scholars to the academic profession \r\nincreases the likelihood that they will graduate and move into postdoctoral and faculty positions. \r\nThe  intellectual  merit of MAGNET-STEM II derives from the acquisition by AGEP \r\nscholars  of  a  broad  background  of  knowledge  that  enables  them  to  relate  issues  in  science, \r\nmathematics, and technology education to one another and to specialize in one of these areas. To \r\nincrease the knowledge base and to develop further their research interests, AGEP scholars will \r\nhave access to affiliated institutions such as Bell Laboratories, Brookhaven National Laboratory, \r\nInstitute  for  Basic  Research  in  Developmental  Disabilities,  the  Albert  Einstein  College  of \r\nMedicine, and the Center for the Analysis and Research of Spatial Information (CARSI), a large \r\nstate-of-the-art GIS and Remote Sensing Laboratory considered to be one of the finest on the East \r\nCoast.  The City University of New York Graduate Center offers to AGEP scholars training in \r\nmentoring,  and  enrollment  in  the  Colloquium  on  College  Teaching  and  in  the  Science, \r\nMathematics,  and Technology  (SMT)  in  Education  Seminars,  which  focus  on  college  teaching \r\nand  STEM  education  from  K-12.    SMT  seminars  address  contemporary  research  issues  in  the \r\nfields  of  mathematics,  science  and  technology  in  education.  This  includes  the  education  of \r\nstudents about technology  in society and its relations to science and mathematics. The CUNY \r\nGraduate Center, as lead  institution,  conducted the  prior AGEP research project,  MAGNET-\r\nSTEM  I  (1999-2004),  which  resulted  in  increases  in  the  number  of  minority  applicants, \r\nenrollments and degree conferrals.  \r\nThe  broader  impacts  of  MAGNET-STEM  II  will  occur  through  the  production  of  an \r\nincreased  number  of  doctoral  students  from  underrepresented  populations  trained  in  their \r\nacademic specialties working in our nation's laboratories and classrooms and who have developed \r\nmentoring  experience.  Moreover,  as  a  result  of  participation  in  the  Science,  Mathematics,  and \r\nTechnology in Education Seminars offered by the CUNY Graduate Center's Ph.D. Program in \r\nUrban  Education,  AGEP  graduates  will  have  knowledge  of  effective  forms  of  curriculum \r\narticulation  and  partnerships  in  STEM  education  that  extend  to  university,  school,  community, \r\nand  corporate  partnerships,  and  that  move  along  the  urban-education K-16  continuum.  In  this \r\nconnection,  AGEP  scholars  will  work  to  prepare  teachers  of  STEM  education,  leading  to  an \r\nimprovement  of  student  achievement  in  STEM  education  within  culturally  diverse  urban \r\npopulations and, hence, to systemic reform.",

Intellectual merit: Participating students met regularly in monthly colloquia not only with doctoral students from their own discipline, but with those from other STEM disciplines, as well as from their peers in SBES. In discussing their research, students learned how disciplines other than their own advance knowledge and benefit society. Additional interdisciplinary perspectives for broader impact were afforded through the annual conferences held at the CUNY Graduate Center at which undergraduates, graduates, postdoctoral fellows, faculty, administrators, and  policy makers from around the country presented  their research, shared views and engaged intellectually on p..."
