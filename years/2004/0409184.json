 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nCoordinated control of multiple robotic platforms, multi-vehicles, or groups of mobile agents is a\r\nrich and fascinating research field and has great commercial and military impact. This project\r\nseeks to achieve coordinated, goal oriented task level control with robustness, failure-tolerance,\r\nand distributed implementation. The PI proposes 1) a probabilistic approach to address the\r\nrobustness issue of the coordinated control subject to parametric uncertainty, dynamically\r\nchanging operating conditions, and the change of neighboring interaction between mobile agents,\r\nand 2) a quorum-system based architecture that defines the neighboring interaction, information\r\nflow and communication configuration of a group of mobile agents.\r\nThe probabilistic approach has a better modeling of the real world with less conservativeness; it\r\nprovides reduced control complexity and enhanced performance and efficient use of control\r\neffort. The proposed feedback control is built on a new architecture that targets distributed\r\nimplementation and failure-tolerance under the constraints of limited communication bandwidth.\r\nThe proposed paradigm for coordinated control of groups of mobile autonomous agents will\r\nprovide a high degree of autonomy for distributed execution of elemental, high bandwidth tasks,\r\nallowing the operator to interact with the system of platforms at a high level. The intellectual\r\nmerit lies in the interdisciplinary nature of this project, which will hopefully foster new\r\nparadigms for coordinated control of groups of mobile agents, and spawn new topics for further\r\nresearch.\r\nThe educational plan includes a strengthening and integration of interdisciplinary research topics\r\nof robust control and distributed algorithms in a graduate level control course. To assess the\r\neffectiveness of the proposed educational activities, the PI plans to collaborate with colleagues at\r\nthe Penn State's Leonard Center for the Enhancement of Engineering Education. The PI herself\r\nis a female member of the faculty; she will continue to work with the Women in Engineering\r\nProgram (WEP) and Society of Women Engineers (SWE) at Penn State to recruit women and\r\nminorities for graduate study, and to encourage them to pursue academic careers after\r\ngraduation.",
