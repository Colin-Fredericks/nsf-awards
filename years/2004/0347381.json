GANESAN\r\nINSTITUTION:\t\t\tUNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN\r\n\r\nCAREER:  A MULTISCALE APPROACH FOR THE FLOW BEHAVIOR OF INHOMOGENEOUS MULTICOMPONENT POLYMERIC MATERIALS\r\n\r\nThis is a multiscale approach, involving the synergistic application of Brownian Dynamics-based simulation along with nonequilibrium thermodynamics and kinetic theories to develop macroscale models that can be used to predict the rheology and response of inhomogeneous and self-assembled polymers.  The long-term goal of this project envisions the application of the macroscale dynamical models to develop a framework for the design of advanced polymeric materials.  Technological advances in the context of electronic storage devices, and the development of composite polymeric materials with novel properties, depend critically on the design and production of inhomogeneous multicomponent polymers.  The educational plan is well integrated with research and focuses on course development and outreach.  A broader impact goal is to enhance diversity by involving undergraduate researchers recruited through the Texas Research Experience Program, which targets students from under-represented and minority groups.  Broad impacts of the work include an on-going collaboration with the office of Equal Opportunity in Engineering program (one of the most comprehensive outreach programs at UT Austin aimed at diversifying the student body) will target students from under-represented and minority groups\r\n\r\n",
