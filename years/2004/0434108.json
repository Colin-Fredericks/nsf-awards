 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Drexel University Noyce Scholarship Program (DUNS) addresses the increasing need for high quality teachers in the School District of Philadelphia. The School District of Philadelphia is partnering with Drexel University to prepare highly qualified teachers to fill current and expected K-12 needs, especially in mathematics and the sciences.  The Noyce program enables 10 science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) undergraduates from Drexel and 15 STEM mid-career professionals from the community to earn the credentials they need to teach mathematics and science in Philadelphia's high-need schools.  These 25 Noyce recipients will be new teachers in addition to the (typically 60) high school teachers produced annually at Drexel, for a roughly 40% increase in production of highly qualified high school teachers in science and mathematics.  Because these schools have large low-income student populations and shortages of highly qualified teachers, the need for high-quality instruction in these subject areas is critical.  The program objectives are to: 1) recruit qualified STEM students and professionals dedicated to teaching in high need urban districts; 2) provide strong preparation addressing content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and technology integration; 3) provide well-designed mentoring and induction to support and retain these teachers in high need urban districts; 4) emphasize recruitment of minorities, and persons with disabilities; 5) instill personal accountability for meeting pedagogy and content knowledge standards for outstanding performance in  the classroom; 6) increase the number of students from partnering schools and at Drexel who may see teaching as a viable career choice for mathematics and science majors.",
