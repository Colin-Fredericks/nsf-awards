 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principle investigator will explore open problems in several areas of\r\nset-theoretic topology.  Convergence properties have important\r\nimplications in a number of fields, yet are not well-understood.  For\r\nexample, it is not known if it is consistent that a space which is\r\nFrechet-Urysohn for finite sets must be first-countable.  Settling this\r\nquestion is likely to lead to a solution of Malychin's well-known problem\r\nwhether it is consistent that separable Frechet-Urysohn topological groups\r\nmust be metrizable.  Two other themes of this proposal involve function\r\nspaces with the compact-open topology.  Settling one of them would solve a\r\n40 year old problem of J. Ceder, and settling the other would yield a\r\nuseful way of determining when these function spaces are Baire spaces.\r\nAnother goal of this proposal is to apply Balogh's magnificent technique\r\nfor constructing ZFC examples , which he used to settle several\r\nlong-standing conjectures, to other problems, and in the process attempt\r\nto simplify and codify the technique to make it easier to use.  Finally,\r\nthere have been a number of recent advances on the D-space property, a\r\nproperty with interesting but not well-understood relationships with\r\ncovering properties, which indicate that the time may be ripe for settling\r\nthe D-space questions of van Douwen that have stumped researchers for more\r\nthan 20 years. \r\n\r\nSet theory and general topology are fundamental mathematical disciplines,\r\nwith common historical roots, and they serve as essential tools in many\r\nareas of mathematics.  General topology provides a framework for the study\r\nof shapes, from ordinary shapes in real three-dimensional space to much\r\nmore abstract shapes and structures.   For example, continuous real-valued\r\nfunctions are a staple of mathematics, and hence the topological structure\r\nof spaces of continuous functions, which is one of the topics that this\r\nproposal centers on,  has important implications in many fields.    The\r\nsame can be said about  the notion of sequential convergence and its\r\nvariants, another topic of this proposal.   The principle investigator's\r\nproposed problems lie within the scope of what has been a fruitful\r\ninteraction  between general topology and set theory, an interaction\r\nspurred by dramatic advances in set theory and logic in the last forty\r\nyears or so and the realization that many long-standing questions in the\r\ngeneral topology of abstract spaces rest on complicated set-theoretic\r\ncombinatorics.  Solutions to the proposed problems would deepen our\r\nunderstanding of the  fundamental topological properties to be explored,\r\nand would likely require new set-theoretical and topological techniques\r\napplicable to a variety of other problems. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
