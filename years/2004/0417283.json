 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative project between the University of Southern California (USC) and the California State University, Long Beach (CSULB). It includes curriculum and course development; institutional development; and teacher development; provides opportunities for hands-on internships for both undergraduate and graduate students; and promotes the understanding and integration of security policy management and enforcement technologies. The project integrates diverse technologies through the involvement of faculty with diverse backgrounds, and provides for teams of undergraduate and graduate students to plan, design, configure, and choose the technology components for \"their secure network and infrastructure for information assurance\" in the project courses. The broader impact of this project includes faculty development through summer institutes and distance education networks, teacher education for teachers in grades 8-12, and short courses in industry. In addition, an introductory, general education course developed at CSULB increases awareness and reaches non-majors and the general public.",
