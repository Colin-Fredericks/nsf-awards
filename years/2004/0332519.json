 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years an important area of research has been that of phenomena that can be represented by large complex networks. These networks arise naturally in many settings, for example, the Internet, the network of telephone calls made, the connection of neurons in the brain, the power grid structure in a country, social networks of acquaintances and various other situations. Tools from the area of Combinatorics have been used extensively to study the properties of these networks with the view of discovering and analyzing their hidden structures.\r\n\r\nAn NSF-CBMS Regional Research Conference titled \"The Combinatorics of Large Sparse Graphs\" is proposed to be held at California State University San Marcos from June 7 to June 12, 2004 with Professor Fan Chung Graham, a leading authority in this area as the principal speaker.  The aim of the conference is to present a unified theory of the research on large sparse networks. We expect that the many applications of the area and the richness of the problems will attract both experts and beginners, especially graduate students, in all areas of discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science.",
