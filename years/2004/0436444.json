 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nCTS-0436444\r\nToni Marechaux, Nat Acad of Sciences\r\n\r\nAs a result of a formal mandate by Congress , The National Academies shall appoint one committee with four sub-panels to conduct a triennial evaluation of the National Nanotechnology Initiative.  The committee and panels shall also perform a one-time assessment of the need for standards, guidelines, or strategies for ensuring the responsible development of nanotechnology.  As part of this effort, the National Academies shall also organize a workshop to study the technical feasibility of molecular self-assembly for the manufacture of materials and devices at the molecular scale. These tasks are intended to evaluate the progress and extent of the multi-agency program, to recommend new or revised goals and metrics, to analyze the relative position of the United States in this growing field, and to analyze the impact of nanotechnology on the U.S. economy. A peer-examined NRC report containing evidence-based conclusions and recommendations based on the committee's consensus will be delivered to the Congress on or before June 10, 2005.   \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposed activity is to provide a forum for an independent assessment of the National Nanotechnology Initiative. In addition to producing a final report, the study activity itself will provide a forum for national-level discussion and interaction centered around the most important issues. Within the realm of nanotechnology, no other forum exists where independent individuals can discuss these issues in such an open and objective way.  National Academies processes ensure voluntary participation from industry, academia, and non-\r\ngovernmental organizations of a type that does not exist elsewhere.  In many instances, such committee activities have resulted in creative and original concepts that have been used to shape future policy implementation and new technology developments. \r\n \r\nThe study will be a formal activity of the Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences. National Materials Advisory Board within The National Academies. The National Academies is a unique institution within the United Stated dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general welfare. Strict internal policies and procedures ensure that the National Academies remains objective and independent in the projects that it undertakes.  The staff assigned to the project are some of the best analysts and writers in the country, and the and the members of the Board are high-level representatives of industry, academia, and government who will bring with them many years of combined experience in a number of related fields.  In addition to the National Materials Advisory Board and staff, a number of other organizations within the Academies and a large number of members of the Academies will be consulted and are expected to contribute to the various study activities. \r\n \r\nThe study process will have an impact well beyond the meeting room in which discussions and presentations will take place. Each member of the committee, as well as the speakers and workshop participants, will take a new perspective back to their organization and will use information obtained through participation to inform future decision making. Ultimately, the broader impact of the study activity and final report is to bring an objective and independent assessment to bear on future program activities of the National Nanotechnology Initiative. \r\n \r\nImpact Statement \r\nThis study activity is intended to educate the public as well as funding agencies and other stakeholders about the larger aspects and potential impacts of the federal government investment in nanotechnology.  The study is designed as a convening mechanism to facilitate dialogue and exchange information among a committee representing all sides of the issues.  This committee will be balanced for a variety of factors, including discipline, institutional affiliation, age, race, gender, ethnicity, and geography, and the committee process will ensure that the members are free of conflicts of interest or excessive bias.  The funding provided will be used for staff time to nominate the committee, organize meetings, arrange briefings and other visits; to compensate committee members and briefers for their travel costs; and finally for photocopying and distribution of relevant information and printing and distribution of the final report.  This final report is intended to be accessible and useful to researchers and students; to program managers with responsibilities in health, space, defense, transportation, and energy; to product developers and business leaders; and to teachers on all levels.  Outreach to the community will be widespread and the ultimate benefits are a greater awareness of national priorities and enhanced understanding of the impacts of the development and implementation of nanotechnology in our society. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
