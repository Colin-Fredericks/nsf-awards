It is developing, packaging, distributing to researchers, and deploying in the Utah Emulab testbed, a low-cost, high-performance, and open software radio platform, \"GNU Radio,\" and extending the Emulab testbed to support it.  Further development of GNU Radio is a research challenge that will lead to increased understanding of software-programmable radios: maximizing programmability while also supporting high performance and reliable operation.  For the hardware, a challenge is keeping costs low while also providing a powerful device.  The project will be an enabler of research in the area of programmable wireless networks.  Further development of GNU Radio hardware and software, integration of GNU Radio into Emulab (for remote testbed access to researchers), and the distribution of Emulab systems (for local experiments invaluable for wireless research due to space sharing limitations) will be a significant asset to the research community.  Public-domain software in conjunction with inexpensive, flexible, programmable hardware integrated within a replicable network testbed is critical to the progress of the flexible wireless systems community.  This effort will also produce educational materials in the form of tutorial articles, sample code, and experiment configurations that are critical to furthering education and research in this area.  This project contains the elements needed to achieve broad impact on the research community, industry, and society overall in the area of programmable wireless radio networks and spectrum sharing..\r\n\r\n\r\n",
