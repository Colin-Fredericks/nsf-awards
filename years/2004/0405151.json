 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Howard University Environmental Biology Scholars (HU-EBS) Project is designed to engage minority undergraduates in environmental biology research projects that are creative, intellectually challenging and of high scientific merit. Faculty members mentor students in projects that span the full range of ecological interactions from populations to ecosystems. The faculty mentors involved in this project provide specific expertise in animal, plant and microbial systems as well as terrestrial and aquatic habitats including field, forest, bog and stream sites.  We provide year-round research mentoring, and help students tackle the difficult transition from undergraduate study to graduate school. We foster a collaborative learning environment to encourage students to participate in the community of science and to learn from each other.  One recruiting tool we use to stimulate interest in our research program is a Field Biology Immersion Course at Mountain Lake Biological Station in southern VA.   \r\n\r\nUndergraduate students are engaged in an ecological research project under the direction of a faculty mentor for two years.  Students and mentors meet monthly in an HU-EBS Research Forum to present research proposals, share data and discuss journal articles. During the Research Forum, students develop skills in presenting research and learn about graduate school programs, scholarships and internships. Students also participate in a Minority Environmental Professionals Seminar Series where they meet with minority role models of success in environmental research and policy. All students are expected to present their results at national or regional scientific meetings, and to submit manuscripts for publication. For students who have completed at least two years of research in our program, we facilitate additional research opportunities at field stations, LTER and REU sites, OTS programs, and at other environmental biology facilities (museums, research cruises, etc). Finally, we work closely with students to help them identify graduate programs in ecology and complete the application process.\r\n \r\nThrough the HU-EBS project, we hope to significantly increase the pool of minority undergraduates that are highly qualified and motivated to pursue graduate study in environmental biology. The faculty mentors participating in the HU-EBS Project have extensive experience in mentoring African American students in environmental biology research. We have learned that strong and consistent mentoring is critical to nurturing the \"flame of interest\" in a career choice such as environmental biology that is non-traditional for our students.
