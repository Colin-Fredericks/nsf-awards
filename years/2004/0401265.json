 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, Avigad and Friedman propose to develop a theoretical base\r\nin mathematical logic to support the development of mechanized proof\r\nassistants for mathematics. They propose to study the definitional structure\r\nof mathematics, and characterize the ways that definitions are used in\r\npractice; to study the methods of inference commonly used in elementary\r\nreasoning in number theory, real analysis, and set theory, and to develop of\r\nalgorithms that can mirror these forms of inference; and to develop an\r\nenriched theory of mathematical proof to characterize and classify the\r\nvarious ``indirect'' methods that are used in mathematical reasoning. A\r\nnovel aspect of the proposal is the attention Avigad and Friedman will give\r\nto actual data, i.e. specific formal developments. In particular, Avigad\r\nwill complete a mechanically verified proof of the prime number theorem, and\r\nis developing a broad number theory library, using a proof system called\r\nIsabelle; and Friedman has begun a fully formal development of set theory\r\nusing in a notational framework of his own devising, with an emphasis on\r\nreadability, for a broad audience.\r\n\r\nThis research is intended to contribute to the general goal of devising\r\nbetter computer support for the development, manipulation, storage, and\r\ncommunication of mathematical knowledge. In particular, formal mathematical\r\nlibraries and means of handling them are important to verify the behavior of\r\nhardware and software systems, for example, and to support scientific\r\ncomputing and cryptography. It is well understood that the development of\r\nuseable proof assistants will have to combine pure logical considerations\r\nwith pragmatic engineering concerns. However, in today's specialized\r\nacademic environments, the relevant communities have become largely\r\ndisjoint. Avigad and Friedman are committed to bridging the gap, by\r\ndeveloping powerful theory that is guided by, and designed to support, sound\r\npractice. \r\n",
