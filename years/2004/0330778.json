 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIntellectual Merits \r\n\r\nWhat was the nature of the first animals?  How have animals characteristics evolved since \r\ntheir origin?  How can we best utilize such knowledge?  These are a few of the questions that can \r\nbe illuminated by comparative and evolutionary studies of animals.  Studies of  .worms and \r\nflies,. the best-studied invertebrate model systems of modern biology, have provided \r\nconsiderable insight into such questions.  Nevertheless, most recent phylogenies of animals \r\nsuggest that nematodes (worms) and arthropods (flies) not only may be relatively derived animals \r\nbut may also share some derived characteristics.   \r\n\r\nThe same recent phylogenies (and older ones as well) generally agree that the basal, non-\r\nbilaterian metazoans are represented by four groups: sponges, placozoans, cnidarians, and \r\nctenophores.  At this time, sponges would seem deserving of an entirely separate treatment, in \r\npart because they exhibit several primitive features and in part because their systematics is in a \r\nstate of flux.  The remaining three groups include: (1) ctenophores, which are often considered to \r\nbe the sister group of the bilaterians, (2) cnidarians, which include some of the best-studied basal \r\nmetazoans, and (3) placozoans, which exhibit a number of unique and enigmatic characteristics \r\nincluding the smallest genome yet found in a metazoan.  In evolutionary and comparative studies \r\nit is often the character states of the basal taxa that have a decisive influence on interpretations of \r\ncharacter state changes throughout the cladogram.  Without detailed knowledge of the basal \r\nmetazoans, it is impossible to provide an effective comparative framework for animal evolution. \r\nDeveloping a clearer picture of character evolution in the metazoans requires both robust \r\nphylogenies and well-documented character states of these crucial basal taxa.  With the recent \r\ninitiation of genomic projects using cnidarians (e.g. the hydroid EST project and the \r\nNematostella BAC library project), it would be timely to consider what sorts of cnidarian model \r\nsystems should be developed and how these systems can be used.  Considerations of how \r\nctenophores and placozoans can complement and contrast to cnidarian models are also essential.   \r\nIn this context, we propose a Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB) \r\nsymposium, .Model systems for the basal metazoans: cnidarians, ctenophores, and placozoans..  \r\nThe goals of the symposium will be to bring together a diverse group of molecular, cellular, \r\norganismal, and evolutionary biologists to discuss appropriate basal metazoan models and the \r\ntopics of integrative and comparative biology that these models are particularly relevant to.  A \r\nsimultaneous SICB symposium, .Sponges: new views of old animals. will nicely complement \r\nour efforts.  To have a significant impact on the subsequent development of these models, these \r\ndiscussions must occur soon. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts \r\n\r\nEvery effort has been made to invite a diverse group of participants, including women, \r\npeople of minority background, as well as graduate students, post-docs, and junior faculty.  A \r\nnoteworthy feature of the SICB annual meeting is its emphasis on young investigators.  \r\nTypically, more than half of those in attendance are Ph.D. students, postdoctoral fellow, and \r\nyoung faculty.  Qualified undergraduates and high school teachers from the surrounding \r\ncommunity are also welcomed.  SICB mounts an extensive program of discounted registration \r\nand subsistence support for Ph.D. students; literally every graduate student member who presents \r\nat the meeting and requests such support will receive it.  Thus, SICB symposium participants \r\nreceive exposure to a broad cross-section of the relevant scientific community.  Symposium \r\nproceedings will be published in Integrative and Comparative Biology.",
