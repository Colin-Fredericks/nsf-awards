 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports partially the participation of 6-12 young researchers in the second international conference on lean combustion, organized by ECI (formerly Engineering Foundation), in Tomar, Portugal, April 25-29, 2004.  Lean combustion is a ubiquitous technology, and the conference will engage leading researchers from a range of countries and from industry as well as universities.  In addition to treating IC engines and turbines, the program will address a variety of new topics, including alternative energy sources, combustion of hydrogen, and digital simulation of turbulent flames.  There will be a poster session, and proceedings will be produced on a CD and possibly in the Combustion Treatise Series.  \r\n\r\nThe discussions at this meeting, both formal and informal, will provide a valuable enhancement for the younger researchers who participate.  Thus, this small investment can contribute to the healthy development of the next generation of combustion researchers. The funding will help to pay travel expenses for 6-12 participants by providing $500-$1000 each.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the activity arises from the participation of combustion experts, their discourse, and the communication among the group.  The broader impact arises primarily from the involvement of graduate students and younger faculty in the symposium to encourage their participation and development in this field. Also, the symposium will promote international networking among the participants.\r\n",
