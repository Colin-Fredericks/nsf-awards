 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at establishing global regularity/asymptotic Stability \r\nresults for certain geometric/physical nonlinear wave equations. Also, it \r\nis hoped that further insight into possible singularity formation is\r\ngained. The first goal is to generalize the PI's earlier result on gobal\r\nregularity of Wave Maps with small energy and smooth data from the three\r\ndimensional Minkowski space to the Lobachevskyi plane to enompass the case\r\nof arbitrary targets of bounded geometry, using partly the PI's method(this \r\nis jointly with D. Tataru). The next goal is to analyze the global stability \r\nof certain large-energy Wave Maps (geodesic, spherically symmetric, \r\nequivariant) under small-energy perturbations of the initial data \r\n(assumed smooth).  It is expected that certain geometric properties of \r\nthe target (geodesic convexity, negative curvature) should ensure that the\r\nWave Maps behave like a free wave at infinity. A related goal is to\r\nestablish the stability of stationary Wave Maps, expected based on\r\nphysical intuition. Finally, the PI hopes to make progress on understanding \r\npossible singularity formation either for Wave Maps(when the target is a \r\nsphere) or related equations, such as Yang Mills. One toy problem would be \r\nto investigate the stability of self-similar blow-up solutions for Wave Maps, \r\ne.g., known in dimensions four and higher.\r\n\r\nThe significance of this work consists in hopefully paving the way for a\r\nbetter understanding of the extremely complex Einstein's equations(these\r\nare related to the Wave Maps discussed above) which govern the spacetime \r\ngeometry of our universe, as well as other nonlinear wave eqations coming \r\nup in the description of fundamental natural phenomena, for example \r\nequations of elasticity or the Yang-Mills equations describing elementary \r\nparticles. The subject is beautifully situated at the crossroads of several \r\npurely mathematical disciplines, such as Harmonic Analysis and Geometry, \r\nas well as more applied areas, such as Numerical Mathematics(computational \r\nsimulations of partial differential equations), Physics and Cosmology. \r\nIndeed, one of the motivations for studying the qualitative behavior of\r\nbreakdown of solutions, as occurs for example during gravitational\r\ncollapse (Black Hole formation), is to lead to more accurate numerical modelling. \r\nThe PI hopes that his research will not only be of interest \r\nto pure mathematicians but also researchers in these other disciplines.\r\n",
