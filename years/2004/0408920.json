 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many natural magnetic minerals undergo transitions at low\r\ntemperature. Scientists investigating the history of Earth's\r\nmagnetic field sometimes use such transitions to help demagnetize rocks,\r\nremoving magnetizations acquired after rock formation. For example,\r\nmagnetite undergoes a change in crystal structure (from orthorhombic to\r\nmonoclinic) at approximately 120 K known as the Verwey transition. A\r\nloss of the magnetic remanence carried by relatively large magnetite\r\ngrains is also observed at the transition. However, our understanding of\r\nthis process, as well as processes associated with transitions in other\r\nnatural magnetic minerals, has to date been based mainly on measurements of\r\ntotal magnetic moment. A prototype device enabling the measurement of\r\ndirections with a SQUID magnetometer during cooling/warming through\r\nlow temperature transitions suggests interesting phenomena,\r\npossibly related to the interactions of magnetic domain walls and\r\ncrystal deflects. The PI will test this hypothesis, compile new directional\r\ndata on a wide range of magnetic minerals, and continue to develop the device\r\nfor low temperature cooling/directional analysis. Broader impacts of the\r\nwork include educational efforts and the development of a research tool\r\nuseful for the rock magnetism and paleomagnetism communities (and the\r\ncommunity in physics interested in magnetic properties at low temperatures).\r\nUndergraduates will take part in the characterization of magnetic\r\nminerals, low temperature remanence measurements and data analyses.",
