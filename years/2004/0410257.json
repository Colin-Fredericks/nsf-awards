 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  This project is a joint effort between analytical and physical chemistry faculty within the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry .  New FT-IR/ FT-Raman instrumentation and existing fluorescence and laser instrumentation (accessorized with a new time-of-flight vacuum chamber) are being integrated into the laboratory component of several analytical and physical chemistry courses using modern teaching methodologies. Case Studies to be used within this cluster are being written by adapting experiments from the educational and research literature.  Students explore the Case Studies by working in small groups and focusing on issues of physical chemical relevance.  \r\nIntellectual merit:  By participating in this project, students are becoming aware of the connection between theoretical aspects learned in the classroom and practical application in the laboratory. They are learning valuable and versatile experimental techniques and are applying these techniques to interesting and challenging problems. The project is exposing students to increasing responsibility for instrument operation, data collection, and interpretation. The approach adapted in this proposal better prepares science students by involving them in the consideration of \"real world\" problems, and by providing \"hands-on\" experience using modern physical and analytical instrumentation and techniques. Students are expected to become more efficient learners, retain what they learn longer, and exercise their critical thinking skills because they are involved in more interesting and challenging experiments than were available prior to implementation of the project. The project engages students in the exploration of science and scientific process, and also integrates modern methods and techniques from research fields into their undergraduate experience.\r\nBroader impacts:  Canisius College routinely graduates approximately 20 chemistry/biochemistry majors and approximately 60 biology majors annually. Recently the Departments of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Biology have experienced a steady increase in the number of graduates who elect to go on to graduate school. In this regard the long term impact of this proposal is large and growing. In addition, Case Studies are be written in a manner that will allow other colleges and universities, similarly equipped, to readily adapt the methods developed.  The educational impact of the project is being quantitatively evaluated using formative and summative assessments that allow detailed statistical analysis to be performed. Results of the project will be reported at national and regional meetings and published in appropriate college science teaching journals. It is anticipated that this proposal will have local, national, and even international impact.\r\n",
