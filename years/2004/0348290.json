 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research on silicon wafer fine grinding, and integration of research results and other advances into engineering education. The objective of the research is to generate the understanding and knowledge of silicon wafer fine grinding necessary for the development of an innovative wafering process flow. Specifically, the research will develop mathematical models to predict the distance and locus of grinding marks and the effects of the chuck shape on grinding marks, and physical models to explain the generation mechanisms of the deepest subsurface cracks and the self-dressing mechanisms of grinding wheels in silicon wafer fine grinding; and validate these models by experiments. The educational activities include improving manufacturing education through curricula, a textbook, and an Internet forum; reaching out to industry through a Web site, online courses, and workshops; and involving women/minority students and K-12 teachers.\r\n\r\nThe results of the research activities will enable wafer manufacturers to produce high quality wafers at low cost. This will result in cheaper and better electronic products, which will benefit the economy and society. Success of the research will also have a positive impact on the environment, because grinding will replace lapping, etching, and a major portion of polishing. This will eliminate or reduce use of environmentally detrimental abrasive slurry and chemicals. The educational initiatives will strengthen the manufacturing engineering program at Kansas State University, promote lifelong learning for industrial practitioners, and broaden participation of the underrepresented groups in research.",
