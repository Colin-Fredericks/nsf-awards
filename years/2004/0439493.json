 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building on the work that \"Investigating and Questioning our World through Science and Technology (IQWST)\" completed in Phase I, a comprehensive science curriculum for grades 6-8 is developed in Phase II.  A learning-goals-driven design is used in which learning performances that drive the design of activities and assessments specify how students should be able to use the scientific ideas and skills outlined in standards. The materials are organized around driving questions that provide a context to motivate students as they use their knowledge and skills in scientific practices -- such as modeling, designing investigations, explanation and argumentation and data gathering, analysis and interpretation -- to acquire understandings of the concepts, principles and habits of mind articulated in national science standards.  The materials contain hands-on experiences, technology tools and reading materials that extend students' first-hand experiences of phenomena and support science literacy.  All four science disciplines are studied for about one-quarter of each year.  The physics topics for grades 6, 7 and 8 are description of motion, conservation and transformation of energy, and laws of motion respectively; in Earth science, the topics are Earth surface processes, climate and weather and objects in space; for biology, organisms and systems, genetics and the environment, and ecosystems and natural selection; and for chemistry, particulate nature of matter, chemical reactions of substances, and chemical reactions all around us.  Teacher materials support teacher learning of the science content and pedagogical approaches.  The materials include an on-line system that provides video examples of student work and pedagogy in action.  The project also includes development of resources for the community so that learning opportunities linked to classroom activities can occur outside of school.  Particular attention is paid to developing reading literacy. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
