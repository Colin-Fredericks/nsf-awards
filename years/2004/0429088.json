 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Georgia teaming with the University of Massachusetts Amherst is examining the prediction that a computer program designed to enhance strategy use and computational fluency will improve mathematics performance. The research also tests the prediction that working with the program will reduce or eliminate previously found gender differences in strategy use and computational fluency.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of the proposed research is to improve the mathematical competency of young children and to reduce or eliminate factors that contribute to gender differences in mathematics performance in early elementary school age children. Earlier research has shown a correlation between cognitive strategy use, computational fluency and mathematics performance and found gender differences in these characteristics.  There is evidence that early developing gender differences result in later gender differences in math test performance.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will involve an experiment where students located in Georgia and Massachusetts will be randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project is its contribution to our knowledge of two factors that are believed to affect mathematics achievement and to affect gender differences in mathematics achievement. The study will determine whether instruction focused on these variables improves mathematics achievement, particularly for girls who tend to have lower test scores, lower fluency and less cognitive strategy use.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed project will be to provide evidence that early intervention can ameliorate early emerging gender differences in math learning. These changes in instruction may have long-term consequences. They might improve the ability of students to perform at higher levels of mathematics in early adulthood and increase their interest in advanced study of science and mathematics. \r\n",
