 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Scholarships to Enhance Mathematics Learning and Research (SEMLAR) program at Wilson College awards scholarships to qualified students and enhances academic and support services already available to students majoring in mathematics.  This project provides funding for 16 scholarships. The objectives of the program are to: \r\n1. Increase the number of women (especially low income and minorities) enrolled in and successful in completing a baccalaureate degree in mathematics. \r\n2. Enhance the educational opportunities for students in mathematics. \r\n3. Improve retention of students within mathematics. \r\n4. Enhance academic support for scholarship recipients. \r\nIntellectual Merit Statement: The program effectively supports students in their study of mathematics and attract new mathematics majors to Wilson College by virtue of the PI.s expertise, which spans middle and high school levels as well as collegiate; the access that students have to student service, financial aid, and career placement professionals; and the depth of experience brought by off-campus mentors, employed in mathematics-related careers.  \r\nBroader Impact Statement:  Sixty-seven percent of women at Wilson College majoring in mathematics advance to post-graduate studies leading to careers in mathematics-related fields. Wilson College successfully prepares women for fields in which they are underrepresented. \r\n",
