 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of General Engineering at Montana Tech of the University of Montana in partnership with the Rocky Mountain Agile Virtual Enterprises Technical Development Center (RAVE TDC) are adapting and implementing the Product and Process Realization curricula associated with the Learning Factory Model. This educational model was originally developed by the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Puerto Rico and the University of Washington. This project is designed to enhance the economic well being of the state of Montana by supporting its light manufacturing industry with innovative educational programs; improve STEM education by developing experiential learning programs; and overcome engineering education competency gaps that have been identified by the Society of Manufacturing Engineers and others. The overall program of study is directed at and supported by a wide range of constituencies including undergraduate engineering students, technology students, manufacturing professionals, high school students and high school math, science and technology teachers. The program has a robust outreach program that is connecting the educational enterprise of Montana with national as well as local technology companies.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project is that it is developing effective and innovative educational programs in design and manufacturing. These programs emphasize multi-disciplinary team building and hands on learning within a modern fabrication facility. The project team has a broad range of competencies and experiences in manufacturing, design, business management and developing complex collaborations. The proposed work is building upon two years worth of effort by the principal investigator to develop a flexible manufacturing research facility within the state of Montana.\r\n\r\nThis project is having a broader impact not only at Montana Tech but also the entire Montana University System. The proposed program is designed to establish a curriculum in which students learn and discover fundamental science and engineering concepts through active learning models that involve extensive development of new products.  RAVE Manufacturing/Prototyping Center (RAVE MPC) supports the project by providing a precision fabrication facility. The proposed educational programs will support the RAVE MPC by developing students capable of effectively working in a modern, precision fabrication facility. This combination will allow the RAVE MPC to become the premier fabricator of scientific and educational instrumentation in the state of Montana and therefore support statewide research and education.\r\n\r\n",
