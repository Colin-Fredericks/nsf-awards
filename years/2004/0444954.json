 "awd_abstract_narration": "EarthScope and associated activities will provide a wealth of data \r\nfrom a wide range of disciplines about how Earth.s crust deforms on a wide range of \r\nspatial and temporal scales. Interpreting these data in terms of the underlying processes \r\nrequires model-based inference. In order to gain better understanding of earth processes, \r\nas well as to address adequately the high quality data that are increasingly becoming \r\navailable from geodesy, paleoseismology, stress measurements, and seismology, it is \r\ncrucial that substantial effort be devoted to improving our models.  While in the short \r\nterm (important for siting of instruments, and guiding development of more sophisticated \r\napproaches), we can make significant progress with relatively simple models; ultimately \r\na large-scale computational effort is needed in order to do justice to the data. We plan a \r\nthree-day workshop at Los Alamos, Aug. 16-19, 2004, with formal discussion periods, but \r\nalso with significant time to conduct hands-on work. The main objective will be to address the issues relating to meshing complex geologic problems.  This workshop is open to all interested members of the EarthScope modeling community; by holding it at LANL, we can take advantage of local expertise in meshing and solving large FEM problems.",
