 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this U.S.-Hungarian research project headed by Brian A. Cole of Columbia University and his partner, Gabor Papp of Eotvos University, is to apply perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations to data from experiments at the Brookhaven Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) facility. This will be accomplished by bringing together a team of U.S. and Hungarian physicists with experimental and theoretical expertise to clarify issues associated with the application of pQCD to the study of nuclear collisions. Their goal is to produce sound baseline calculations against which heavy-ion data can be tested for novel experimental signatures.  Results are expected to extend the range of problems for which pQCD can be applied and tested. Success should produce fundamental quantitative information from high-momentum transfer scattering processes and contribute to our understanding of the interaction of quarks with matter. This will interest astrophysicists and cosmologists as well as the nuclear physics community.   \r\n\r\nThis project in theory and heavy ion nuclear science fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.   Broader impacts include the introduction of U.S. students and post docs to the international nuclear physics community through work at the Hungarian institution and their direct involvement in the project's efforts to improve the discovery potential of RHIC.",
