 "awd_abstract_narration": "Homologous chromosomes must recognize and pair with each other in meiosis to insure the production of euploid gametes and to maintain genomic stability. Although recombination has been proposed to play a critical role in both the homology search mechanism and the maintenance of homolog associations, observations on recombination-deficient mutants in flies and worms reveal that many of the visible aspects of partner choice and synapsis are recombination-independent. Alternative mechanisms also exist to balance poleward forces and maintain bivalent integrity in the absence of chiasmata. How homolog pairing is initiated and maintained in the absence of recombination is poorly understood. The goal of this project is to gain insight into recombination-independent mechanisms of meiotic homolog pairing and adhesion by characterizing the teflon (tef) gene in Drosophila melanogaster. This gene is required for autosomal bivalent integrity at meiosis I in male flies, and represents one of the first genetic inroads towards understanding how chromosomes pair in the absence of recombination.  A critical piece of information required for determining teflon function is the intracellular localization of its protein product. The goal of this project is to generate tools- peptide antibodies and transgenic flies-  for localizing Tef protein in the male germ-line. \r\n \r\nThis project will provide undergraduate students with the opportunity to participate in an integrated molecular and genetic study of a basic biological mechanism.  This experience will help prepare them for advanced study and careers in science.\r\n",
