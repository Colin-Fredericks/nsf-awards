 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knot theory and 3-manifolds have recently seen the fruition of several\r\nlong-standing programs. The aim of the conference is to give a forum for\r\nthe research community to assimilate recent advances and emerging techniques\r\nin the field. The broad perspective of the conference is particularly \r\nimportant for bringing young researchers to the forefront of the field;\r\nconsequently, special attention will be paid to the support of graduate \r\nstudents and postdocs.\r\n\r\nKnots and the three dimensional spaces in which they live have long\r\nbeen important objects of study in mathematics. More recent times have shown\r\nthat the area is intimately related to\r\nmany other branches of mathematics as well as to physical\r\nsciences like biology and cosmology. This has\r\nprovided renewed impetus for understanding these spaces. The\r\nconference will bring together experts in various fields all of which have\r\nconnections to knot theory and 3-dimensional spaces, with the\r\nintention of disseminating recent important results in the area, providing an\r\noverview of the current state of research, as well as directions for future\r\nexploration. These talks are aimed at both experts and novices in the area.\r\n\r\n",
