 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit \r\nChemical reaction engineering  (CRE) is the field that deals with chemically reacting systems of engineering significance. It results in a general methodology useful in approaching a variety of systems (chemical, biochemical, biological, materials, environmental, electrochemical) where engineering of reactions is needed to produce products of value. \r\n \r\nCRE is required in the development of both existing and newer technologies.  In addition to its established critical role in the petroleum, petrochemical and chemical industries, it is necessary to speed up commercialization of new specialty and commodity chemicals, materials and biotechnology products. For example, CRE is playing a major role in the development of fuel cells for automobiles and stationary applications, and in the design and discovery of pharmaceutical drugs. \r\n \r\nPerhaps the most important events for the international CRE scientific community are the biennial ISCRE conferences (International Symposium on Chemical Reaction Engineering).   These conferences bring together, for three days, distinguished international researchers in reaction engineering,  prominent  industrial  practitioners,  along  with new researchers and students of this multifaceted field.  In these conferences, the state-of-the-art of various sub-disciplines of CRE is reviewed in a timely manner, and new research initiatives are discussed.  \r\n \r\nBroader Impact  \r\nThe ISCRE 18 participants will benefit from state-of-the-art reviews and presentations by leading experts, by exchanging the latest advances on frontier research subjects, and by debating controversial points with their peers in the CRE discipline.  The meeting will provide an opportunity for interaction and cooperation among industrial and academic researchers, from various countries around the world.    The award of travel funds and registration subsidy are expected to attract many graduate students, including women and minority, to the meeting that they may otherwise be unable to attend.  The students and other young researchers will have an opportunity to interact with each other and with experienced researchers in the field, which will positively influence their professional development.   \r\n",
