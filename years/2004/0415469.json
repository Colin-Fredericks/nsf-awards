 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research involves the development of asymmetric synthetic methods for the production of a variety of oligosaccharides.  The reaction strategy is centered on the use of the Achmatowicz rearrangement for the preparation of pyranones in concert with palladium-catalyzed glycosylation.  The methodology will lead to the production of new and hitherto unknown unnatural oligosaccharides having interesting materials and biological properties.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. George A. O'Doherty in the Department of Chemistry at West Virginia University.  Dr. O'Doherty will focus his work on developing methodology for asymmetric synthesis of oligosaccharides.  The methodology will allow for the facile incorporation of simple sugars into oligosaccharide motifs thus leading to the discovery of new structures possessing a wide range of functions. The broader impact of the work is in the area of materials science as well as the pharmaceutical industry.  Further, the project presents an excellent vehicle for the training of both undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n",
