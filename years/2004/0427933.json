The award is jointly supported by the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences Division of Materials Research, Physics Division and Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, and the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biosciences Directorate.  The workshop will be comprised of about fifty participants working in five topical areas.  These areas are: biomolecules; cell biology - simple structures; cell biology - complex structures; systems biology; and education and infrastructure.  Discussion groups have been set up on the workshop homepage so that all can contribute to the workshop.  A report will be produced that will provide guidance to NSF and the theory community.\r\n%%%\r\nThis award supports a Workshop on the Role of Theory in Biological Physics and Materials to be held in Tempe, AZ, from May16-18, 2004.
