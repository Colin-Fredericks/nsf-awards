THOLE AND LEE S. LANGSTON\r\nINSTITUTION:\t\t\tVIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST./UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT \r\n\r\nGOALI: COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH:  THERMAL AND FLOW CONTROL FOR AIRFOIL-ENDWALL JUNCTURES\r\n\r\nThe goal of the research program is to advance fundamental understanding of three dimensional flows and their consequences on heat transfer in turbomachines.  A primary objective is to define an approach for industry to use in modifying junctures at the turbine airfoil-platform interface to reduce the presence of three-dimensional flows and their effects on both aerodynamic losses and heat transfer.  The intellectual merit consists of investigating the following fundamental issues:  the impact of a geometric modification at the leading edge-platform juncture on the development of the secondary flows within an airfoil passage; the impact of a geometric modification on the aerodynamic loss and surface heat transfer; and the influence of compressibility on these modifications at the leading edge-platform juncture.  The broader impact of this investigation includes determining a new methodology that can be applied to reduce the impact of three-dimensional flows present in all turbomachines.  From an economical consideration, it is important that the US remain a stronghold in both military propulsion and power generation.  The knowledge and understanding gains from this investigation allow the US to make more efficient use of energy resources and to retain its stronghold in the gas turbine sector of the economy.  The success of this new approach to designing turbine airfoils will impact the $200B electric power generation industry, which requires $20B-30B/year in gas turbine equipment. The broader impacts include training of graduate students at two different institutions and their participation in the industrial collaboration.  In addition to the students involved directly with the research, a number of students will be educated on relevant issues in the gas turbine area by the Pratt and Whitney industrial team member.  The PI's are strongly committed to increasing participation of underrepresented groups in the US, and Prof. Karen Thole already has a strong track record in this area.\r\n\r\n\r\n*co-funded jointly by the Fluid Dynamics & Hydraulics, Thermal Transport & Thermal Processing programs\r\n",
