The proposed goal is to be accomplished with an integrated theoretical and experimental approach.  First of all, a multiscale method is proposed to extend the length scale limit of the quantum-mechanical method in order to realistically predict the electro-mechanical coupling in CNT structures.  The simulation results will be verified by the proposed experiments.  The advanced experimental approach is featured by the integrated electronic and mechanical characterization of CNT structures through flexible handling of nanosized materials and high resolution visualization of the measurement.  The proposed efforts will aim to understand the fundamental electro-mechanical coupling in CNTs having realistic dimensions for application and provide valuable parameters related to the functionality and reliability of such CNT electromechanical devices.\r\nThe research goals will be fully integrated with the strong educational efforts.  An educational plan that centers on modeling and characterization of nanomaterials will be developed.  A new curriculum will be designed for both undergraduate and graduate students.  Two Ph.D. students will receive training with the support of this grant.  New tools will be used to enhance the teaching and research efforts.  By promoting interests and providing knowledge that is suitable for both starters and professionals, the efforts are directed towards a broad base.\r\n\r\n",
