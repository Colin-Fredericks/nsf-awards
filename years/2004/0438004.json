 "awd_abstract_narration": "0438004\r\nYang\r\nMicrolenses are widely used in various technologies including telecommunication. The position and geometrical features of these lenses are fixed and cannot be changed by external control. Thus, there is a great need for the development of microlenses with adaptive capabilities. This proposal offers a highly promising approach toward the development of a multifunctional microlense array that is designed based on what is known about the structure and function of the eyes of brittlestar. The proposed optical devices with novel architectures, tunability and tailored functionalities will mimic the structures and functions of the biological prototype compound eyes of a brittlestar. This is an example of how novel nanofabrication techniques can be used to develop new functional systems that are inspired by nature. The proposed structure is developed by synthesizing biomimetic hydrogel microlens arrays with integrated pores using 3D micropatterning techniques to fabricate small, hierarchical material structures in a large scale as well as responsive hydrogels and microfluidics techniques that allow for manufacturing of microdevices that provide multifunctional adaptive optics features. Collectively, utilization of these techniques offers highly unique potential for manufacturing of micro-optical devices with unique features that can be made light weight and produced inexpensively. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the applicants will synthesize a variety of photosensitive hydrogel precursors that can be directly patterned using three-beam interference lithography; 2) fine-tune the shape, size and/or refractive index of the biomimetic hydrogel microlens arrays in response to external stimuli; 3) reversibly tune the lens optical properties by transportation of microfluid through pore channels using an electrowetting pump.",
