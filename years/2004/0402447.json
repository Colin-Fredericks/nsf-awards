 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing, implementing and evaluating an innovative web-centric, Collaborative Learning Environment (CLE), and a set of instructional tools that feature emerging technologies for secure logistics. This is leading to 1) faster, more effective training in global logistics practices and technologies; 2) support of critical training in \"secure\" logistics in the wake of 9/11; and 3) providing targeted logistics education and training for global industry. The CLE is being developed and tested jointly by the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill and Lenoir Community College (LCC) in Kinston, NC.\r\n\r\nThe project is organized under the leadership of the North Carolina Consortium for \r\nLogistics Education (NCCLE), a consortium of educational institutions and industries in eastern North Carolina led by LCC and UNC. The state-of-the-art logistics laboratory and distance learning facilities at the Education and Training Center (ETC) of the North Carolina Global TransPark (GTP) is assisting with broader dissemination.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. This innovative new educational platform, available completely\r\nonline, is supporting both existing and new programs including: 1) the new online A.A.S. Global Logistics Technology (GLT) degree program offered by LCC; 2) diploma programs for technician training at the community college level; 3) logistics certification programs for professional organizations; and 4) customized training programs for local, state and national industry.\r\n\r\nThe proposed CLE represents a fundamental change in how logistics is taught-moving\r\nfrom traditional written curricula to online collaborative exercises that are consistent with current trends in business and secure logistics. The focus of this project is on training students to understand the use and impact of emerging new technologies for real-time visibility and control of the logistics process.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. This project is responding to a pressing industry need for technicians who are trained to use new technologies (such as RFID tags, scanners, intelligent software, etc.) and practices that are being implemented to protect the country from disruptive events-from terrorist attack to natural disaster. The CLE and supporting tools have been designed to be accessible to nontraditional students from disadvantaged NC groups (at-risk teens, Hispanics) and women, as well as individuals trapped in stagnant industries who seek to transition to the logistics field. The program is completely available online, and thus is available to students anywhere across the country. North Carolina has approved a new tuition structure that will also make it more affordable to disadvantaged and other out-of-state students. \r\n",
