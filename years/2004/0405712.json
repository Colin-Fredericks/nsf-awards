 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe proposer's recent research has centered on knot theory and the\r\ntheory of 3-manifolds, particularly Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds\r\nand related notion of unknotting tunnels.  The main approach might\r\nhumorously be called neo-classical, for it focuses on the behavior of\r\nsurfaces contained in the 3-manifolds (a classical approach) but in a\r\nmore sophisticated way.  For example, in combinatorial arguments on\r\nsurface intersections, graph-theoretic lines of argument (on the arcs\r\nof intersection) have proven to be almost magically effective in\r\ndistilling geometric information; in Gabai's theory of sutured\r\n3-manifolds, intersection with a `parameterizing surface is the chief\r\nmechanism for transmitting information from the end of the hierarchy\r\nback to the beginning; the minimax principle usually called ``thin\r\nposition\" exploits the intersection between a stationary surface and a\r\nmoving surface to understand the topology of the entire manfold.\r\nComparing intersections between two sets of moving surfaces (using the\r\ntools of Cerf theory) can be even more effective as in, for example,\r\nthe Gordon-Luecke solution to the knot complement conjecture or the\r\nproposer's work with Rubinstein on explicit bounds for Heegaard\r\nstabilization.\r\nThe problems addressed in this proposal have been chosen not solely\r\nfor their intrinsic interest but also because the hope is that\r\ntechniques developed in their solution would point the way to the\r\nsolution of grander problems and, more generally, give insight to the\r\ngeneral structure of knotting phenomena (broadly construed) and the\r\nstructure of 3-manifolds, particularly structure that is on the edge\r\nof and interacts with natural questions about 4-manifolds.  An\r\nunderlying theme of this proposal is that there is much to be learned\r\nabout knot theory and the theory of 3-manifolds via a geometric\r\napproach that is more flexible than differential geometry but more\r\nstructured than simple combinatorics.  This medium ground is\r\ncharacterized by a use of thin position arguments, in which sweep-outs\r\nof 3-space by level planes or sweep-outs of 3-manifolds by Heegaard\r\nsurfaces can reveal structure that might be difficult to find by other\r\ntechniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most basic observations about the world around us, apparent\r\nalmost from our birth, is that it is 3-dimensional.  So it is of\r\ninterest to understand objects with this property: anyone living in\r\nthe object would see their world as 3-dimensional.  Such objects are\r\ncalled 3-manifolds, and the broad goal of this research proposal is to\r\nincrease our understanding of them.  Three-manifolds support\r\ninteresting phenomena.  One of these phenomena is knotting, in which a\r\nsimple object like a garden-hose (or a string of DNA) can be\r\nmaneuvered so that its positioning in space is quite complex.  More\r\ngenerally, objects like chemical molecules can be put in a 3-manifold\r\nin extraordinarily complex ways if one thinks of their parts as made\r\nof rubber which can be knotted and interweaved.  Tools which are being\r\ndeveloped to understand 3-manifolds help us understand knotting and,\r\nconversely, understanding knotting helps us understand 3-manifolds.\r\nOne success of this ongoing research program is the proposer's\r\nsolution (with Abigail Thompson) of the graph-planarity problem: There\r\nis a simple criterion, algorithmic in execution, which determines\r\nwhether a knotted graph in 3-space (e.  g. a chemical molecule) can be\r\nisotoped to lie in a plane, and so in fact is unknotted.\r\n",
