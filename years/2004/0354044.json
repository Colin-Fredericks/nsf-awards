 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site engages undergraduate students in primary research of natural resource and environmental management in a unique international setting.  Twelve undergraduates will be selected to participate in an eight-week summer research program in China.  The students will work on an array of important topics, such as climate change, biodiversity protection, community-based resource management, and poverty alleviation.  As the world's largest developing country with rapid growth, profound institutional change, and serious environmental problems, China offers a \"living textbook\" for the study of economic development and resource management. By examining China's experiences and lessons, this project will benefit students in several concrete ways.  Among other things, they will acquire the fundamental methodology and hands-on experience of executing a research agenda, master the principles and techniques in social and environmental sciences and apply them to solving real-world problems.   REU participants will gather at Michigan State University for the first week of the Site, spend the next five weeks in China conducting research, and return to MSU for the final two weeks to complete papers and presentations.  While in China, they will spend time in Beijing as well as Sichuan, the location of the Wolong Panda Reserve.\r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.\r\n",
