The fascination of diophantine problems -- the study of whole number\r\nsolutions of polynomial equations-- goes back to ancient times.\r\nThe mathematical techniques developed in the last 50 year to\r\nattack such questions have lead to significant advances in our knowledge\r\nof this subject, for example the proof of Fermat's last theorem.\r\nThese same tools have, meanwhile, proved to be of great importance\r\nin cryptography, the construction of new algorithms for computer science\r\nand new error correcting codes for electronics.\r\nShimura varieties are the geometric objects\r\nassociated to systems of diophantine equations \r\nwith a great degree of symmetry. Their diophantine \r\nproperties have deep connection with many important parts of mathematics.\r\n\r\nAn extensive study will be made of the arithmetic geometry of\r\ncycles on Shimura varieties, with an emphasis on the interaction\r\nof their heights, arithmetic intersections and density properties\r\nwith modular forms and special values of L-functions and their\r\nderivatives. Applications will be made to Gauss's class number\r\nproblem, equidistribution problems for cycles on Shimura\r\nvarieties, and the Andre-Oort conjecture, and the Tate and Bloch-Beilinson\r\nconjectures.  This collaborative project will take\r\nadvantage of recent developments including nonvanishing properties\r\nof Fourier coefficients of modular forms,\r\nthe theory of Borcherds forms and their connections with theta \r\nfunctions, and integral representations of Langlands L-functions. \r\nA long range goal of the project is to establish relations\r\nbetween the height pairings, periods, and algebraic cycles and the\r\nderivatives of L-functions.\r\n",
