 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this research is to develop an improved understanding of university\r\nresource allocation in agricultural research by examining the ethics and values associated\r\nwith research outputs (articles, patents, and doctorates), potential changes in the\r\ndirection of and audience for scientific researchers (e.g., basic vs applied, firms for\r\nlicensing vs broader public dissemination), and the observable quality of the research (in\r\nterms of citations, licensing revenues, or other measures). The project will examine the\r\nresource allocation process at the university level as well as at the level of individual\r\nresearchers within the agricultural and life science colleges of U.S. Land Grant\r\nuniversities (LGU).\r\n\r\nAt the university level, the project is built on a 20-year panel database on university\r\nresearch inputs, outputs, and patent revenues that two of the principal investigators\r\n(Barham and Foltz) have developed over the past 4 years. At the individual level, the\r\nproject will undertake a major survey of university researchers at LGUs asking them\r\ndetailed questions about their research direction, outputs, grant sources, stakeholders,\r\nand attitudes. This survey of scientists follows up on a previous survey done by another\r\nof the principal investigators in the mid-1990s (Buttel) as well as an earlier effort by\r\nLacy and Busch in 1979.\r\n\r\nThe research methods in this project advance the literature on academic patenting in a\r\nnumber of important ways. First, the theoretical framework, \"motivation crowding,\"\r\nprovides a novel framework for understanding how monetary incentives affect scientists'\r\nethics, values, and research choices and the framework's use advances the theory by\r\nproviding an empirical test of its propositions. Second, by building on past data\r\ncollection efforts, this work will have both cross-section and time-series information\r\nthat can advance our understanding of scientist ethics, values, and research choices.\r\nThird, this work will be able to integrate the scientist data with university level\r\ninformation across time and universities. Fourth, by having an interdisciplinary research\r\nteam, this project will be able to combine the ethics and values concerns of sociology\r\nwith the data and theory driven analytic tools of economists.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates a series of regulatory and legal changes that appear to be\r\nhaving a major impact on the way in which research is done at agricultural colleges in\r\nLGUs. The incentives created by university patenting are changing the ethics and values\r\nof scientists, the types of projects they choose, the outlets for their research, and how\r\nthat research gets disseminated to the public (e.g., patents or open publications). Given\r\nthe central role of public sector research to generating new agricultural technologies\r\nover the last century, these changes in LGU research focus and scientist values may have\r\nsignificant impacts on the long-term sustainability of US agriculture (Goldberger and\r\nButtel, 2001).\r\n\r\nA deeper understanding of resource allocation and outcomes in university research can\r\ncontribute toward the design of better policies and incentive structures to promote\r\nagricultural and life science research at LGUs, including efficiency and equity outcomes.\r\nFindings from this study will be presented to key decision makers at Land Grant\r\nuniversities, in state legislatures, and to interdisciplinary audiences.\r\n",
