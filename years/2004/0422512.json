 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is awarding thirty scholarships per year to students who are enrolled in a computer science, engineering or mathematics transfer program. \r\n\r\nThe project includes support systems to monitor, intervene, promote and foster academic achievement and successful completion of a degree and continuation of studies to a four-year degree program. Individual education plans provide a foundation for continually assessing student progress, which provides a support mechanism to help students persist towards achieving their degree. The principal investigators are monitoring early intervention strategies. Assistance in solving problems is being provided by mentors, staff and college services. A referral process is used to connect students with outside agencies that provide no-cost services to low-income individuals and their families. Students interact with peers, faculty members, university faculty and industrial representatives through the STEM Club that was created and staffed by students, the STEM Club Web Site, Engineering Day and Engineering Week that are supported by technology companies such as Honeywell and Intel, hosting the Science Olympiad, and a monthly speaker series. The project targets women and minorities. \r\n\r\nThe project is using the structure of a previous successful CSEMS grant. The project supports many transfer initiatives that provide opportunities for students to transfer to Arizona's universities and the college's systemic reform efforts to develop effective educational innovations. \r\n",
