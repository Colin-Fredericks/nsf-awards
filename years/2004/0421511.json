 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThe objective of this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) project is to procure instrumentation and equipment specifically for an Explosive Loading Laboratory (ELL), which is currently under construction. The ELL will allow for one-of-a-kind real time blast and impact testing of structural components, assemblies, and systems of critical infrastructure such as buildings and bridges in a controlled environment. The testing laboratory is the first facility in the world that can accurately and repeatedly performs simulated explosive loading tests and characterize their effects on structures for use in developing retrofit and hardening optimization technologies without creating actual explosions.\r\nDuring large- or full-scale testing of structural systems or assemblies at the ELL, a large array of sensors will be distributed in specific locations such that precise measurements can be obtained to investigate the development of non-linear failure mechanisms. A vital element in the development of the ELL is the procurement of robust, state-of- the-art instrumentation and sensors that can be operated in an outdoor environment, data acquisition systems and high performance networking capabilities. The key components are: real-time distributed data-acquisition systems, a high-speed digital camera, camera measurement systems, a range of conventional sensors such as DCDTs. \r\nThe vision is to provide the ELL with sufficient instrumentation that can be used to integrate state-of-the-art blast engineering experimental and computational research into educational curriculum using internet-based technologies. The equipment requested for the ELL can be leveraged to promote research being conducted at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography (SIO) at UCSD, for further development of ROADNet, a network and information management system that will deliver data to a variety of end users in real-time. \r\n The state-of-the-art ELL facility, will add a significant new dimension and capabilities to existing United States testing facilities and promote research in Structural Engineering, Dynamic Systems and Control, and Information Technology.\r\n",
