 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to increase the overall number of graduates in computer science, computer engineering, and mathematics (CSEM). Scholarships provided are a vital component of the college's plan to achieve these goals. There is a particular emphasis on increasing the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of academically talented but economically disadvantaged students from underrepresented populations in CSEM fields. The university's traditional undergraduate student body is comprised of more than 53% minorities including African Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanics.   \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: There are commitments from many faculty members to assure the success of a very diverse student body and a comprehensive plan designed to assure that scholarship funds provided through this program are used effectively to meet program objectives.  To reach the program objectives, the project is: 1) working with school districts, community colleges and community agencies to recruit targeted students, 2) improving the student support infrastructure available for the CSEM students, 3) expanding partnerships with business and industry to enhance the scholarship recipients' opportunities for hands on experience and employment in a variety of high technology positions common in Southern California, 4) increasing the number of students that seek graduate degrees in these fields, in part by enhancing undergraduate research  opportunities, and 5) increasing participation in  professional activities. Placement in industry is being enhanced through formal internships, liaison with government and industry as well as through alumni and professional networks.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project is expanding contact and synergy with government and industry, stronger preparation of students for direct entry into research and technology based positions, and refinement of a comprehensive model for use by similar colleges and universities. Strengthening of the technical programs benefits the entire university through enhanced IT support.  Benefits range from administrative computer programming and support of instructional technology, to high tech activities such as fuel cell research, molecular modeling, network integration of analytical instruments and IT based science outreach programs.  Students serving in this capacity on campus or at other institutions carry their skills into the general technical work force.   \r\n",
