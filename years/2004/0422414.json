 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the State University of New York, College at Fredonia establishes the Mathematics and Computer Science (MACS) Scholarship Program to increase the number of students who enter, pursue, and complete rigorous programs in pure mathematics, applied mathematics, and computer science. Specifically, the project supports a total of 30 scholarships annually, at $3000 per scholarship. The MACS Scholarship Program objectives in terms of Intellectual Merit are:\r\no To increase the number of students majoring in mathematics and computer science.\r\no To increase retention of mathematics and computer science majors through mentoring.\r\no To increase internship and other experiential learning opportunities for our majors.\r\no To better prepare our majors for technical careers, and to place our graduates in companies that will allow the use of their skills and education.\r\no To increase the number of our graduates earning graduate degrees.\r\nIn terms of Broader Impacts this project selects students, encourages them to achieve their best academic performance, and enables them to enter the workforce in their fields involves not only the department, but the entire campus, including student support programs such as Career Development, Academic Advising, and the offices of Admissions and Financial Aid. The plan has the following components:\r\no An Advisory Board made up of faculty and professional staff from the campus as well as external individuals from organizations such as the Chautauqua County Industrial.\r\no Development Agency and regional businesses and industry.\r\no A scholarship Selection Committee, made up of MACS mentors and representatives from the offices of Financial Aid and Admissions.\r\no A recruitment plan.\r\no Support activities and programs both on- and off-campus.\r\no A formative and summative or outcomes-based evaluation/assessment plan.\r\n",
