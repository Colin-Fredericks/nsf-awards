 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smectite-illite interstratified clay minerals are ubiquitous in sedimentary basins. The smectite to \r\nillite  transformation  is  linked  to  the  maturation,  migration  and  trapping  of  hydrocarbons,  the \r\ndevelopment of pore pressures, rock cementation and porosity reduction, and pore water chemistry. \r\nDespite the importance of the reaction, considerable ambiguity exists as to how smectite is converted to illite as a function of geological variables. It is well known that the smectite to illite transformation is  approximately  concomitant  with  maturation  of  petroleum  during  sediment  diagenesis,  but  the relationship between organic matter and clay mineral reactions has yet to be rigorously established. \r\nWe  hypothesize  that  the  linkage  is  in  the  role  that  microorganisms  play,  in \r\nregards  to  organic  matter  oxidation  coupled  to  metal  reduction,  in  the  smectite  to  illite \r\ntransformation. Sufficient evidence has accumulated that abundant (~106 cells/g) and active microbes and clay minerals co-exist in argillaceous rocks. Metal-reducing microbes have been discovered at burial depths of ~3000 meters, and at up to 100oC. These conditions bracket those commonly found during clay diagenesis. Viable microbes (104-105 cells/g) also exist in organic-rich shales, and their abundance may be higher at the onset of clay diagenesis or in those shales under the .overpressure. condition. Both field and laboratory evidence suggest the important role of microbes in clay mineral reactions, but the functional linkage between microbial activity and clay mineral transformations is poorly understood. Our recent investigations have shown that microbes can transform nontronite (a smectite  variety)  to  illite at  room  temperature  in  one month. This  reaction  typically  requires much higher temperatures over extended time periods in absence of microbial activity. \r\nWe propose to investigate the effects of microbes on the smectite to illite transformation, using \r\nunique and powerful analytical tools including environmental cell transmission electron microscopy \r\n(EC-TEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Specifically, the goals of this three-year \r\nproposal are to 1) investigate the effects of subsurface bacteria on the extent and rate of the smectite to illite transformation under diagenetic conditions; 2) determine mechanisms of the transformation process;  3)  explore  how  microbes  affect  kinetics  of  the  transformation.  We  hypothesize  that microorganisms promote the smectite to illite transformation via 1) reduction of structural Fe(III) in smectite;  2)  production  of  organic  acids.  Fe(III)-containing  smectite  (0.5-4.2  mmol  Fe3+/g)  is common  in  natural  environments.  To  simulate  smectite-illite  diagenesis,  the  effects  of  bacterial Fe(III)-reduction  will  be  studied  at  three  different  temperatures  (30oC, 61oC,  and  90oC) using mesophilic,  thermophilic  and  hyperthermophilic,  Fe(III)  reducing  bacteria  (S.  putrefaciens,  G. metallireducens, Bacillus infernus, Geothermobacterium ferrireducens). A variety of natural smectite samples will  be  used.  Reduction  experiments will  be  designed  under  well-controlled  conditions  to mimic  diagenesis.  Reduction  products  will  be  analyzed  by  a  variety  of  techniques,  including chemical extraction, XRD, EC-TEM, EELS, Mossbauer spectroscopy and oxygen isotopes. Attempts will be made to integrate microbial effects into smectite to illite transformation models, which will have major implications for organic matter maturation and petroleum migration.   \r\nBy  the  end  of  this  project,  we  will  have  answered  the  following  questions: 1) do microbes \r\naccelerate the smectite to illite transformation under diagenetic conditions? 2) how do they achieve \r\nthis acceleration? 3) what are mechanisms for the smectite to illite reaction in presence of bacteria? \r\nBroader  impacts.  The  proposed  work  will  be  carried  out  with  collaborations  between  national \r\nlabs  and  university,  and  will  involve  three  PI.s  and  their  3  students  for  three  years.  Students will work  in  both  academic  institution  and  governmental  labs  to  gain  unique  research  experiences. Workshops,  web  pages,  course  materials,  newsletters  and  museum  exhibits  will  be  developed  to efficiently and broadly disseminate research results. Major efforts will be made to deliver lectures to those institutions without PhD program and underrepresented, as well as K-12 schools.",
