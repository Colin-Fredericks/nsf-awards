 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hsieh-Klefstad Abstract\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThis research project is developing new software engineering principles,\r\ntechniques, and programming technology based on an improved understanding\r\nof how crosscutting concerns, such as real-time behavior and memory\r\nconstraints, interact and can be modularized within embedded middleware.\r\nThis project investigates how a combined component-based and\r\naspect-oriented software engineering approach can advance the development\r\nof embedded applications and middleware.  Experience with existing\r\nmiddleware for distributed, real-time, and embedded (DRE) systems has\r\nillustrated both the benefits and the limits of implementing\r\nconfigurability through previous approaches to components and aspects.\r\nThe research goal is to achieve expressive power through an\r\nintegration of components and aspects.  The new model supports aspect\r\ndefinition and application at the component level: aspects are constructed\r\nthrough new compositional forms, and conversely, aspects introduce\r\nfunctionality at the level of component definitions and interconnections.\r\nReal-time predictability constraints are addressed through the model's\r\nsupport for real-time Java: components and aspects adapt to real-time\r\nconcerns according to their contexts.  The model allows developers to\r\nmanage complexity in new ways: by allowing flexible middleware\r\nconfiguration; by supporting both component-like encapsulation and\r\ncontrolled exposure to aspects; and by providing sound type checking of\r\nmiddleware configurations.  The new techniques are being validated through\r\nthe development of new, modular, and highly configurable DRE middleware\r\nfor real-time Java.  \r\n\r\nThe knowledge that comes from this research will\r\ndrive progress in embedded systems development and enable more effective\r\ntechniques for modularizing concerns across application and middleware\r\nboundaries.  The project's technology is expected to be particularly useful for \r\ndesigning and building embedded and real-time software systems, as well as software\r\nsystems in general.  Both component systems and middleware have become\r\npopular commercially; this technology should enable and demonstrate the evolution of future component systems and middleware.\r\n",
