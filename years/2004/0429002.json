 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe Directorate for Engineering at the National Science Foundation has established a strong focus for\r\nstudy concerning future investments in Cyberinfrastructure that may be made by the Foundation. Inside of\r\nthe Engineering Directorate, the Cyberinfrastructure Working Group has completed a portfolio assessment\r\nof research and education awards, and is now arranging for a series of workshops that explore the\r\nopportunities for supporting the development of a national Cyberinfrastructure, and for leveraging these\r\ninvestments and partnering with the academic, government and industry sectors. While the first two\r\nworkshops organized and held at the NSF in Arlington in June 5-6, 2003 and January 13-14, 2004 took a\r\nvery broad, i.e. horizontal, look at the Cyberinfrastructure initiative to scope out the critical issues that\r\nneed to be addressed during the development of Cyberinfrastructure, this third workshop is poised to\r\nfollow some of the leads generated by the earlier workshops and to concentrate on the need to develop a\r\nstrategy that permits and entices the involvement of the entire engineering community, by identifying key\r\nchallenges in cyberengineering/cyberinfrastructre research.\r\nIn order to facilitate the organization of the 3 rd Workshop, NSF has invited 7 individuals from the\r\nengineering community to serve on the organizing committee, OC. These are\r\nDr. Massoud Amin, U. of Minnesota, Twin Cities (ECS rep.)\r\nDr. Shirley Dyke, Washington University (CMS rep.)\r\nDr. Jim Rawlings, University of Wisconsin (CTS rep.)\r\nDr. Ming Lin, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (DMII rep.)\r\nDr. Ulrich Neumann, University of Southern California (EEC rep.)\r\nDr. Michael Piasecki, Drexel University (BES rep. & proposal lead)\r\nDr. Bill Spencer, U. of Illinois, Urbana Champaign (CMS rep.)\r\nDeliverables\r\nEach of the workshop breakout groups will be asked to summarize the findings of their respective task.\r\nThese findings, together with the Personal Points of Views, PPVs, and the 3 page research idea\r\nsubmissions of the selected presenters will be compiled into a final workshop report by the OC that will be\r\nsubmitted to NSF. More specifically the deliverables will contain:\r\nReport of the Workshop as a reference material for the ENG community\r\nDevelopment of material for posting on the website\r\nA set of recommendations for developing Divisional level workshops sessions\r\nA camera ready copy for the printing of the proceedings.\r\nTo this end, the OC will establish a NSF Engineering Cyberinfrastructure Workshop III website (to be\r\nhosted on one of the servers in Dr. Piasecki's computer lab) that will announce the workshop, post\r\nrelevant information concerning the workshop schedule and agenda including the participant list, and\r\nprovide information for hotels, travel, and directions to the Drexel campus in general and the meeting\r\nvenues in particular. In addition to the site hosting the final workshop report, it will also be used to post the\r\npresentations as well as position statements or personal point of views (PPVs) from each attendee that\r\nshould be submitted prior to the start of the workshop.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nThe broader impact of this workshop lies in its scope, i.e. the attempt to identify research opportunities in\r\ncyberengineering and cyberinfrastructure development. Recognition of the opportunity to conduct\r\ncyberengineering/cyberinfrastructure research is very much linked to the necessity to achieve a broad\r\nacceptance in the engineering communities, i.e. the willingness of these communities to embrace a\r\nconcept that is open to all and not restricted to a few domain experts that have a high developed interest\r\nin making use of cross-disciplinary ideas involving computer science and engineering. This workshop is\r\nalso focused on identifying idlow hanging fruitsly that can be harvested by many in the community without\r\nhaving to become cyberinfrastructure experts, i.e. having to crosswalk into the computer science domain.\r\nThe presentation of research ideas and development drivers should provide a good overview what are the\r\nkey areas of cross-cutting cyberinfrastructure that is important to the engineering communities, and what\r\nthe scope of the initiative is. This must be understood as a precursor to entice the community to further\r\neducate itself and attempt to embrace these new concepts.",
