 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this proposal is on homogeneous continua. Progress in classifying homogeneous \r\ncontinua has been slow but fertile with new ideas. The results concerning the pseudo-arc \r\nand the Menger curve are the most spectacular studies, which have opened new areas in topology. \r\nWe are still far from having a complete classification of homogeneous continua in 3-space, \r\nand may expect further surprising results. New results in this area can have significant \r\nimpact on continuum theory and geometric topology. New examples of homogeneous continua may \r\nbe important as geometric objects, admit interesting compact group actions, and play an essential\r\nrole in topological dynamics. A significant part of the project concerns the study of homogeneous \r\n1-dimensional continua, which is a well established area. It is intended to explore the main stream \r\nquestions asked in the past by J. T. Rogers, P. Minc,  D. P. Bellamy, W. Lewis and others. \r\nThe following two questions, among others, are also asked: \r\n(1) Is each 2-dimensional locally connected homogeneous continuum in 3-space either a surface \r\nor the Pontryagin sphere? \r\n(2) Is 2-sphere  the only simply connected, nondegenerate homogeneous continuum in 3-space?\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout mathematics and its applications the idea of symmetry plays a special role. The most\r\nimportant objects, such as special functions, curves, equations, polygons, polyhedra, manifolds \r\nand other geometric or topological spaces, frequently have strong symmetric properties. Generally, \r\na space has ``strong symmetry\" if it admits a large collection of selftransformations that preserve \r\nall relevant properties. From the topological view point a (topological) space has ``strong symmetry\" \r\nif it admits a rich collection of 1-to-1 continuous self-transformations whose inverses are also \r\ncontinuous. Such transformations are called  homeomorphisms. The most studied  topological spaces, \r\nsuch as manifolds, satisfy this description. If each point of a space can be mapped to every other \r\none by some homeomorphism, the space is called homogeneous. The circle and 2-sphere are the simplest \r\nexamples of such spaces embeddable in 3-space. The purpose of this project is to contribute to progress \r\nin classifying homogeneous compact connected spaces different from manifolds with particular stress on \r\nthose contained in 3-space.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
