 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SGER proposal is to support a graduate student in exploratory research of the social, economic, and political dimensions of the development of Arctic fisheries.  The concept surrounding the proposal is a novel one based on the possible increase in open water available to commercial fishing fleets as a result of decreasing thickness of sea ice in the Arctic.   The PI argues that if current climate trends continue, it is foreseeable that the Arctic could become available to commercial fishing, increasing the potential for conflict between an extractive industry and indigenous populations.  The proposed research is to interview policy makers, government resource managers, scientists, commercial fishers, and indigenous stakeholders to determine the potential for the development of an Arctic fishery, the social and economic factors surrounding such development, and the perceptions and preparation of local people.  The proposed research is appropriate for a SGER as it is \"preliminary work on untested and novel ideas,\" as well as \"a venture into emerging research.\"",
