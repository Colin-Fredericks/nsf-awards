 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project introduces an innovative gas sensor technology for the remote inspection/monitoring of gas leaks along a gas distribution system.   The micro-miniature sensor is a highly engineered instrument based on a proprietary infrared technology using optical and acoustic (opto-acoustic) effects.  As an alternative to costly and labor-intensive inspections, the sensor could be deployed for unattended operation in remote gas distribution nodes, e.g. pressure regulator stations, providing round-the-clock, high-speed measurement and notification in real time, a new control technique between the field and utilities control centers.  The sensor's round-the-clock monitoring and real-time notification should give the ability to locate and repair gas leaks in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop and commercialize the gas sensor to monitor gas leaks in gas compressor, field compressor, pressure regulator and city gate stations, the major sources of gas leak along the distribution network.  Target customers are gas transmission and distribution companies, but also Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) serving the oil & gas industry.  The objective of this SBIR Phase I project is to build and test a gas sensor prototype to prove the technical and economic feasibility of the opto-acoustic concept and the new features contributing to improved performance.",
