The program's awards provide opportunities for joint research, and the use of unique or complementary facilities, expertise and experimental conditions abroad.\r\n\r\nThis award will support a twenty-two-month fellowship by Dr. Susan J. Schofer to work with Professor Bjorn Akermark and Dr. Licheng Sun, Stockholm University (Organic Chemistry, primary hosts); Professor Leif Hammarstrom, Uppsala University (Physical Chemistry) and Professor Stenbjorn Styring, Lund University (Biochemistry, collaborators in the Consortium for Artificial Photosynthesis (CAP)).\r\n\r\nThis project is aimed at the development and study of novel manganese complexes that use energy from sunlight to catalyze the production of dioxygen from water, with the ultimate goal of coupling this process to a catalytic reaction that produced dihydrogen from water for use as a fuel.  The development of an efficient and practical energy system from an environmentally friendly and renewable source is critical to the survival and further progress of mankind.  Splitting water into dihydrogen and dioxygen in a reaction driven by light represents a promising approach to addressing this energy need; utilizing principles based on natural photosynthesis (the process by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy) to design an artificial system for manganese-catalyzed production of dioxygen from water is a significant component of this goal.  We are developing a novel manganese trimer, which may be attached to a light-harvesting molecule to combine these critical components and may be capable of accomplishing the goal of catalytic dioxygen generation from water.  Current work involves the synthesis and characterization of the trimeric manganese complex.  Once this is accomplished, we will investigate the reactivity of this compound for its ability to catalytically oxidize water to dioxygen.  If this is possible, we will couple this species to a light-harvesting complex that can ultimately drive this process using energy from the sun.  Through this project, the PI will learn a variety of new techniques while pursuing a project that will enhance current understanding of the role of manganese complexes in the oxidation of water to dioxygen.  Any results of research in this field should be disseminated broadly to promote technological advances in the global search for new energy sources.  \r\n",
