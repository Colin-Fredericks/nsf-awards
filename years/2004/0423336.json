 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, conducting research in the areas of sensor networks and distributed and cluster computing, experiments with precision-based query processing over sensor networks and wireless networking. Since sensor devices are powered by ordinary batteries, power constitutes a limiting resource in sensor networks. To address this limitation, power-aware query techniques are proposed for aggregation queries. Instead of providing users with exact answers, precision is introduced, giving full control to the users of the tradeoff between precision and energy usage. Another project studies the design and implementation of a self-organizing storage cluster built upon commodity components, investigating performance and availability of  large-scale storage clusters as well as load balancing and data replication support, suitable for data intensive applications. Off loading techniques that effectively partition computation across devices are also under study, since these techniques can significantly extend the life of hand-held devices. Still another project investigates techniques to effectively partition computation across devices conserving the \"virtual battery life\" of the system. improving the efficacy of future partitioning decisions. Considering feedback from the system, the techniques should be able to \"adapt\" to changing conditions in the system. The off-loading techniques for heterogeneous systems include three categories of devices: sensors, mobile devices, and power workstations. The research seeks lightweight service discovery solutions that can determine the resources provided by nodes in the heterogeneous network. The infrastructure enables research in the following areas:\r\n\tSensor Information Processing,\r\n\tSensor Data Collection,\r\n\tCluster-Based Data Storage,\r\n\tPower Management of Sensor-Based System Components, and\r\n\tWireless and Service and Resource Discovery in Sensor Networks.\r\nThe proposed infrastructure will be used to experiment with precision-based query processing over sensor networks.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The  lab infrastrucure provides means to integrate a variety of sensing devices with different characteristics. Academic, as well as commercial research will benefit. Software artifacts and experience into novel curricular directions impact the training of students.\r\n",
