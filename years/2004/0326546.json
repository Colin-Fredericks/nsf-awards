 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite decades of research in extensible operating system\r\ntechnology, extensions such as device drivers remain\r\na significant cause of system failures. In Windows XP, for example,\r\ndrivers account for 85% of recently reported failures.\r\n\r\nIn this project, the researchers are developing a reliability subsystem\r\nfor commodity operating systems.  Their approach is\r\nto improve OS reliability by isolating the OS from driver\r\nfailures.  Rather than guaranteeing\r\ncomplete fault tolerance through a new (and incompatible) OS or\r\ndriver architecture, their goal is to prevent the  vast majority of\r\ndriver-caused crashes with little or no change to existing\r\ndriver and system code.  To achieve this, they isolate drivers within\r\nlightweight protection domains inside the kernel address space.\r\nDrivers run largely unchanged in kernel mode, but are prevented\r\nfrom corrupting the kernel by both software and hardware means.  The \r\nsystem\r\nalso tracks a driver's use of kernel resources to hasten automatic\r\nclean-up during recovery.\r\n\r\nTo prove the viability of their approach, they are implementing a system\r\ncalled \"Nooks\" in the Linux operating system and are using it\r\nto fault-isolate several device\r\ndrivers.  Their initial results show that Nooks offers a substantial \r\nincrease\r\nin the reliability of operating systems, catching and quickly\r\nrecovering from 99% of the faults that would otherwise crash the system.\r\nWhile Nooks was designed for drivers, their techniques generalize to\r\nother kernel extensions as well.  The researchers are demonstrating\r\nthis by isolating a kernel-mode file system and an\r\nin-kernel Internet service.\r\n\r\nOverall, because Nooks supports existing C-language extensions, runs on \r\na\r\ncommodity operating system and commodity hardware, and enables\r\nautomated recovery, it represents a substantial step beyond the\r\nspecialized architectures and type-safe languages required by previous\r\nefforts directed at safe extensibility.\r\n",
