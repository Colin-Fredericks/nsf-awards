 "awd_abstract_narration": "Characterization of the Acidovorax-Earthworm Association\r\nDavid A. Stahl\r\nUniversity of Washington\r\n\r\nThe common earthworms (lumbricids) are among the most well recognized of soil-dwelling animals.  Favored by gardeners for their composting abilities, they are active in altering soil structure and nutrient availability in soils throughout the world.  Soil transformation is not solely due to the earthworm, but is assisted by microorganisms living in association with the worm.  The best understood associations occur in the worm's digestive system.  The worm's gut selects for a variety of microbial populations and activities not prevalent in the soil.  A much more specific association is found in the worm's waste fluids elimination system.  Each segment of the worm contains a pair of internal kidney-like organs (nephridia) adjacent to the body wall (ca. 200 nephridia per worm) that eliminate fluids (\"urine\").  Unlike the diverse microbiota of the gut, a single species of microorganism is present as a dense population in each nephridium.  This appears to be a stable and specific association since different species of earthworm harbor different symbiotic Acidovorax species.  The character of this association and the bacterial contribution to the development, physiology, and excretion chemistry of the host are virtually unexplored.  The main objectives of this project are to resolve the early events of colonization and determine the contribution of bacteria to host physiology, including symbiont-conferred changes in host tissue architecture.  These studies are enabled by the ability to maintain the full life cycle of the worm (Eisenia foetida) in the laboratory, and the recent success of these investigators in resolving and reforming the symbiosis.  The worm can be \"cured\" and later reunited with its symbiont by inoculating egg capsules with symbiotic bacteria propagated in pure culture.  This offers the opportunity for experimental manipulation of each stage of the symbiosis.  A combination of analytical chemistry, molecular genetics, and microscopy (confocal laser scanning microscopy and electron microscopy) will be used to characterize the association.  The bacterial contribution to the earthworm fluid chemistry and tissue architecture will be evaluated by comparing worms with and without their symbionts during development and at adulthood.  The contribution of the bacteria to the overall fitness of the worms will be evaluated by comparisons of growth rates, reproduction rates and response to certain environmental stresses of worms with and without their symbionts.  Characterization of bacterial symbiont in pure culture will be used to identify metabolic traits relevant to waste transformation.  Genetic modification of the symbiont will also be evaluated.  The development of tools for genetic manipulation would greatly enable more highly refined studies of microbe-animal associations, including the identification of factors governing the specificity of colonization.  The results from this work will contribute to an understanding of the physiology and chemistry of this abundant, widespread and ecologically significant member of soil systems.  More generally, this symbiosis could provide a new model system for resolving basic features of the most common type of interaction between animals and bacteria, host epithelial tissues colonized by extracellular, gram-negative bacteria.\r\n",
