 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will support the continuation of the experimental research\r\nprogram of the intermediate energy experimental nuclear physics group at\r\nRutgers University. The three faculty members collaborate with a large\r\nnumber of physicists throughout the world on experiments at Jefferson\r\nLaboratory in Newport News, Virginia, home to CEBAF, a continuous beam\r\nelectron accelerator with energies available up to 6 GeV. In keeping\r\nwith the mission of the Laboratory, the experiments of the group are\r\ndesigned to unfold the quark structure of nuclei and nucleons. The major\r\nwork for the coming grant period will be concentrated on the following\r\nmeasurements at Jefferson Laboratory: deep virtual Compton scattering,\r\nneutron spin structure, and the nucleon elastic form factors. The first\r\ntwo measurements are intended to explore the substructure of the nucleon\r\nmeasuring the position and momentum distributions of the quarks making\r\nup the nucleon.  The last elastic measurements study the properties of\r\nthe nucleon as a whole.  The combination of these measurements and\r\nothers will help us understand the complex region where the description\r\nof a nucleon as composed of quarks and gluons transforms into a picture\r\nof nucleons surrounded by clouds of mesons. This grant period will also\r\nsee an expansion of the group's activities to the study of neutrino\r\ninteractions at Fermilab, in Batavia, Illinois.  The goals are similar\r\nto those being pursued at Jefferson Lab.  However, neutrinos have a\r\ndifferent sensitivity to the substructure of the nucleon than do\r\nelectrons and photons.  The study of neutrino interactions allows us to\r\ndevelop a more complete understanding of the nucleon structure.\r\n\r\nBeyond improving our basic understanding of nature, this project will\r\nhelp train students in the techniques of basic research.  Past students\r\ntrained by this group have gone on to contribute to society in diverse\r\nfields including medical physics, management of nuclear waste and,\r\ndevelopment of state of the art vacuum instrumentation.\r\n",
