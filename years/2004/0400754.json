 "awd_abstract_narration": "In computable algebra, one applies the methods of classical \r\ncomputability theory to study computational properties of algebraic \r\nstructures.   Solomon proposes to study several questions concerning the members of\r\nthese and other classes of algebraic structures.   Do the members of a \r\ngiven class display the most general forms of ineffectiveness found in \r\ncomputable algebra?  Are instances of ineffectiveness caused by the \r\ncoding methods (and hence can be removed by a reasonable coding) or by \r\nsome inherent property of the underlying algebra (and are therefore \r\nunavoidable)?  How does adding structure (such as an ordering) to the \r\nmembers of a class effect the computational properties?  These \r\nquestions aim toward a deeper understanding of the connection between \r\ncomputation and algebraic behavior in mathematics.   \r\n \r\n\r\nMany theorems in mathematics state that given certain conditions, a \r\nparticular mathematical object must exist.  There are numerous ways to \r\nstudy the effectiveness of such a theorem.  One method, called \r\ncomputable or recursive mathematics, uses an idealized model of a \r\ncomputer in which computations are allowed to run for arbitrarily long \r\n(but finite) amounts of time and to use arbitrarily large (but finite) \r\namounts of memory.  The fundamental question is whether such an \r\nidealized computer can construct the desired mathematical object from \r\nthe theorem.  If the answer to this question is no, then the theorem \r\nuses a method of construction that cannot be performed on an actual \r\ncomputer no matter how much technology increases computer speed and \r\nmemory size.  Because this question requires that mathematical objects \r\nbe coded into the binary language of computers, the answer sometimes  \r\ndepends on the type of coding used.  Solomon proposes to study a number \r\nof algebraic constructions from this point of view and in particular to \r\nstudy when ineffectiveness is caused by a poor choice of coding (and \r\nhence can be fixed by a better choice of coding) and when it is caused \r\nby inherent conflicts between mathematical structure and computation \r\n(and hence cannot be removed by clever coding).  Solomon also proposes \r\nto use a second method, called reverse mathematics, to study the \r\neffectiveness of numerous mathematical theorems.  In this approach, one \r\nisolates the mathematical axioms required to prove the theorem.  \r\nReverse mathematics and computable mathematics are closely related.  If \r\nonly simple axioms are required to prove a theorem, then it is likely \r\nthat a computer can carry out the construction, while if complicated \r\naxioms are required, then a computer probably cannot perform the \r\nconstruction.\r\n",
