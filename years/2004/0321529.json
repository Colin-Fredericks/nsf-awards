 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project proposes to develop technologies to automatically generate large meshes appropriate for finite element and similar analyses directly from CAD model representations. This will be done using scalable, parallel algorithms that will enable the generation of meshes on distributed parallel computers including workstation clusters. The result of this project will be software that is capable of generating meshes with hundreds of millions of elements in an efficient manner. The generated meshes will already be partitioned to be compatible with the needs of parallel analysis codes.\r\n\r\nThe commercial applications of this research are in those industries that need to perform large-scale simulations of complex problems over general domains. The procedures to be developed will allow simulation based design technologies to be applied to applications that demand massive simulations. By enabling these large-scale simulations for industrial problems, this technology will enable the more widespread and effective use of numerical simulation in the design of manufactured products in all industries (automotive and aerospace being two major industries with an immediate need for this technology). The software developed in this project will be available for licensing to all CAD/CAE software developers to enhance the capabilities of their products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
