 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in the area of wireless communications demand high-performance radio frequency circuits for effective on-chip implementation. This project focuses on the development of a new and novel class of flexible and tunable radio frequency integrated circuits enabled by new device designs and novel use of materials.  To accomplish this goal, this work will explore novel ways in which magnetic materials may be used to make wireless devices and systems tunable. Specifically, we propose to pursue three major advances in wireless device and system design: 1) Fixed and tunable high performance integrated passive elements such as integrated inductors will be developed combining novel structure geometries and ferrite thin films. 2) New schemes for on-chip tunable transmission lines using ferrite thin films will be proposed. 3) For the first time, noise and crosstalk suppression schemes using high-loss, high permeability ferromagnetic thin films will be proposed. In a fourth and final element of the project, we propose to develop a variety of on-chip test structures to demonstrate the advantage of the new configurations in terms of compactness, improved performance, tunability and crosstalk suppression. \r\n\r\n\tWhile we will make every attempt to fulfill the scope of the originally proposed research, due to the revised available resources, we have modified the scope to address the following key research goals:\r\n \r\n1.\tInvestigate new topologies for high inductance, high quality factor ferrite inductors that are compact and compatible with on-chip technologies. \r\n2.\tDevelop novel latching schemes for controlling the magnetic properties of the ferrite material that are suitable for on-chip tunable inductors and transmission lines with controllable characteristics.\r\n3.\tDevelop innovative use of high-loss ferromagnetic thin films to suppress on-chip noise/ crosstalk. Various schemes for possible layout will be studied.\r\n4.\tDevelop suitable ferrite plating technology for effective on-chip implementation\r\n5.\tDevelop novel use of micromachining techniques for the fabrication of proposed structures. \r\n6.\tDevelop a magnetically tunable bandpass filter to demonstrate the tunability.\r\nDevelop suitable on-chip interconnect structures to demonstrate crosstalk suppression.\r\n\r\n     The ability to fabricate magnetically tunable devices and components for on-chip implementation would have a revolutionary effect on the wireless industry.  This work is a first serious look at a number of processing techniques, materials, and device design challenges that must be solved to make this vision a reality. The PIs strongly encourage minorities, women and members of under-represented groups to participate in their research program.\r\n\r\n",
