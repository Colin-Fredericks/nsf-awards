 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on the technological feasibility of the use of the Conversim [TM} dialogue model to convey curricular material.  This work includes developing and documenting the protocol for transforming lecture material into an effective virtual dialogue program; measuring student acceptance of learning critical, curricular material this way; and measuring the learning success of the students.  This Conversim [TM] model represents a new paradigm in education, one that allows the student to learn through a personal interview of the master teacher.  The paradigm includes non-directive, independent learning by conducting face-to-face dialogues with master teachers who are always present, always available, and always willing to converse with people who wish to engage them.  Conversim [TM] software combines speech recognition, digital video and personal computer technologies to allow PC users to have \"face-to-face\" dialogues with video characters.  Scientific research has shown that most users enjoy the virtual dialogue experience, many have significant, often accelerated, learning gain, and almost all feel as though they have met the person with whom they have been \"talking.\"  Multimedia presentations can be used in concert with the dialogue to clarify concepts and complex topics.  Also, the power of the computer for tracking and for innovative, dynamic evaluation strategies is inherent in this model.\r\n     The broad objective is to make this model and this new paradigm available in all educational institutions that would benefit from its use.\r\n",
