 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research project is to understand how the enzyme CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT) regulates cellular phosphatidylcholine synthesis.  CCT is the rate limiting enzyme of the CDP-choline pathway and therefore is extensively regulated.  Translocation of soluble CCT to the surface of a cellular membrane results in enzyme activation, a reversible process that can be mimicked in vitro through association of purified CCT with synthetic lipid vesicles.  There are two CCT isoforms present in higher eukaryotes, including Drosophila melanogaster and humans.  This research project is designed to determine the role(s) of each individual enzyme isoform within a eukaryotic cell.  RNA interference using cultured Drosophila melanogaster Schneider 2 cells will be employed to selectively \"knock out\" each CCT isoform.  The first research objective is to identify the cellular location of each Drosophila melanogaster CCT isoform.  A second objective is to determine whether each CCT isoform is essential for cell growth.  The final research objective involves elucidation of the contribution of each CCT isoform to phosphatidylcholine synthesis.  Completion of the research will provide information about the relative contribution of each CCT isoform to cellular phosphatidylcholine synthesis, elucidate additional roles of CCT within a eukaryotic cell, and provide insight into the necessity of multiple CCT isoforms for the function of eukaryotes.  \r\n\r\nBroad Impact: A broader impact of the research is manifested in the positive effect it will have on the research development of undergraduate students and the educational environment of Illinois State University, a predominantly undergraduate institution.  Support for undergraduate Biochemistry majors to conduct full-time summer research fosters a scientific career at a critical, early stage.  Independent laboratory research is a valuable complement to the extensive classroom training undergraduate students obtain, allowing application of the scientific knowledge learned in the classroom.  In addition, students will obtain technical training in the use of specialized, modern scientific equipment.  The result will be a graduate who is well-prepared to begin pursuit of a graduate degree in science.  \r\n",
