 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chromatin plays a central role in gene expression during eukaryotic development and mediates epigenetic phenomena. Our goal is to determine the mechanisms that contribute to chromatin-based control of gene expression using maize, a premier model for these studies.  It is becoming increasingly clear that understanding chromatin-level control of gene expression in plants cannot be extrapolated from other eukaryotes. Rather, direct experimentation in plants is needed.  Understanding how chromatin controls gene expression in maize will provide new knowledge and molecular tools for precisely and effectively manipulating gene expression and phenotypes in this and other important crop plants.\r\n\t \r\nWe will identify additional maize chromatin genes, including RNA-based silencing genes; complete a new set of chromatin mutants for maize (both RNA interference lines and recessive mutations); test function by assaying lines for 1) paramutation and epigenetic variegation; 2) transgene silencing; 3) loss of imprinting; 4) DNA methylation; 5) histone modification of repetitive elements; 6) changes in gene and transposon expression profiles; and 6) chromosome cytology.  New vectors will enable high-throughput screens of cellular localization and protein-protein interactions. The combination of different types of functional data will provide an integrated picture of chromatin-level regulation of gene expression. \r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to the education and training of students and postdoctoral students who will work in the participating research groups.  In addition, plant genomics will be the focus of programs for science teachers and for undergraduate student interns.  At the University of Arizona, high school teachers will join plant genomics labs for an 8-week summer program featuring individual lab work and development of genomics modules to use in their high school science classes.  At the University of Missouri, science teachers will take part in a one-day workshop called \"Chromatin: All Wrapped Up\" as part of a year-long workshop series focusing on different aspects of plant genetics and genomics.  The University of Missouri will also host undergraduate students from around the country to participate in 8-week summer internships as part of the Plant Genomics Internships @ MU program.  All of these educational programs actively seek participants from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nAccess to project outcomes\r\nAll resources will be available through the Maize Genetics Stock Cooperation (http://w3.aces.uiuc.edu/maize-coop/) and data will be available through The Plant Chromatin Database (ChromDB: http://www.chromdb.org/).  \r\n",
