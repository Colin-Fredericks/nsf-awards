 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports acquisition of a variable-pressure Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and an associated Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) for multidisciplinary use. In conjunction with the award, the Institution is providing significant in-kind support, including funds for laboratory renovations, technician support, service contracts, PI release time and advanced training of eight users. The SEM/EDS instrument will be located in recently constructed science center that houses all of the physical and life science programs.  Availability of the instrument will permit active, leading edge research by science faculty that will improve scientific knowledge and provide valuable experience to students.  Planned research and class projects involve the investigation of a wide variety of specimens, including animal tissues, bacteria, viruses, microfossils, minerals, rocks, microelectronic devices, Native American ceramics, ancient Tunisian coins, and architectural materials.  Thus, students will be able to participate in the high resolution imaging (2D and 3D) and compositional analysis of a diverse array of materials, the study of structure-function relationships in biological systems, structure-function-property relationships of solids, and surface analysis of chemical systems in a manner that is not possible with traditional light microscopy or with other analytical instrumentation.  An established Summer Science Research Program will enable use of the instrument in training and education throughout the entire calendar year.  The instrument is expected to be the most widely used analytical equipment on campus. The proposals describes 13 research projects that reflect the broad range of research interests among the science faculty and students.  Faculty from six departments on campus (the four science programs, Classics, and Historic Preservation) intend to utilize the SEM to optimize student learning in their courses.  Demonstrations and/or hands-on training with SEM/EDS techniques will be incorporated into six biology courses, five geology courses, a physical chemistry course, a new physics course, classical archaeology courses and historic preservation courses.  In addition, planned community outreach activities will target local high school students to foster greater interest in science.",
