 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is aimed at a fundamental understanding of dynamic processes - diffusion, viscosity, \r\nviscoelasticity  -  in  any  polymer  material  containing  more  than  one  chemical  repeat  unit.  Such \r\nmulticomponent  polymers  .  a  class  that  includes  miscible  and  immiscible  blends,  random  and  block \r\ncopolymers,  and  their  mixtures  .  are  ubiquitous  in  modern  macromolecular  science  and  technology. \r\nDescription  of  the  dynamics  of  single  component  polymers  has  advanced  considerably,  primarily  via \r\nreptation-based models,  but  the  extension to multicomponent  systems  lags  behind. There are  two main \r\nobstacles:  (i)  limited  understanding  of  the  composition  and  temperature  dependence  of  the  local \r\nsegmental dynamics that underly all mechanisms of chain relaxation, and (ii) incomplete understanding of \r\nthe effects of mixing on the mechanisms of chain dynamics. The proposed research will address both of \r\nthese  issues  through  strategic  measurements  on  model  systems,  using  a  unique  combination  of  three \r\npowerful techniques: rheology, oscillatory flow birefringence, and diffusion.  \r\nIntellectual Merit \r\n  Recent research has revealed a variety of fascinating phenomena in the dynamics of binary polymer \r\nmixtures, attributable to the fact that the temperature dependences of the segmental mobilities of the two \r\ncomponents  are  distinct.  This  \"thermorheological  complexity\"  arises  both  from  intrinsic  differences  in \r\nflexibility, an intramolecular contribution, and from differences between the bulk, average composition, \r\nand  that  of  the  local  environment  surrounding  a  segment.  A  partial  explanation  for  these  observations \r\nbased on the idea of self-concentration, the local enrichment of the environment in like monomers due \r\nsimply to chain connectivity, has proven capable of describing much of the phenomenology. Furthermore, \r\nit  provides  an  organizing  principle  by  which  the  behavior  of  various  systems  can  be  classified,  and  it \r\nhighlights  those  future  experiments  that  are  likely  to  be  most  revealing.  The  three  experimental \r\ntechniques in combination will allow precise extraction of the dynamics of each component, in carefully \r\nselected model blends, over broad ranges of composition and temperature. These data should enable full \r\ncharacterization  of  the  local  dynamics,  which  in  turn  will  direct  the  development  of  an  improved, \r\npredictive model. Then, with an understanding of local dynamics in hand, it will be possible to address \r\nseveral longstanding issues concerning chain dynamics, via the same experimental protocol. In particular, \r\nmeasurements  of  the  composition  and  temperature  dependent  viscosity  on  the  same model  blends  will \r\nallow detailed testing of proposed models, such as \"double reptation\", for the effects of polydispersity on \r\nchain dynamics. Furthermore, the extraction of the full frequency dependent response and diffusivity of a \r\ndilute  component  in  a  mixture  will  lead  to  an  experimental  resolution  of  the  longstanding  \"constraint \r\nrelease versus contour length fluctuations\" controversy in linear viscoelasticity. \r\nBroader Impact \r\n  The  vast  majority  of  commercial  polymer  materials  are  processed  in  the  liquid  state,  where  the \r\nviscoelastic response (both linear and non-linear) ultimately dictates what can and can't be done. As the \r\nfraction  of  commercial  materials  that  may  be  considered  \"multicomponent\"  increases  steadily,  the \r\nimportance  and  utility  of  both  \"correlative\"  (i.e.,  take  what  is  observed  and  relate  it  to  molecular \r\nvariables) and \"predictive\" (i.e., predict properties based on molecular variables) schemes grows as well. \r\nThe  research  described  herein  shows  promise  of  providing  the  first  reliable  predictive  scheme  for  the \r\nviscosity  of  a  miscible  polymer  blend.  Furthermore,  the  underlying  concepts  should  contribute  to \r\npredictive schemes for the viscoelasticity of other multicomponent systems, and in the longer run for the \r\nnon-linear flow properties as well. \r\n  This  program  integrates  teaching  and  research  over  the  full  range  of  polymer  science  .  synthesis, \r\ncharacterization,  morphology,  rheology,  dynamics,  and  theory  .  for  students  in  chemistry,  chemical \r\nengineering, and materials science programs. This breadth of training has made group alumni attractive in \r\nboth academic and industrial settings, and to companies extending well beyond the traditional polymer \r\nindustry.  Regular  opportunities  for  mentoring  undergraduates,  and  for  presenting  research  results  at \r\nnational scientific meetings and to audiences of industrial scientists, constitute an essential component of \r\ngraduate student education in this program.",
