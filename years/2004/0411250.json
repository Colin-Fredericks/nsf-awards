 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nThe project implements the concept of higher-order discovery experiments (DEXS) into the chemistry curriculum, enhancing conceptual learning of chemistry. This involves modification of existing expository experiments, adaptation of new discovery experiments from the literature, and the creation of virtual computer-simulated discovery experiments. The project involves eight general chemistry, introductory chemistry, and organic chemistry laboratory courses and honors courses in general and organic chemistry. The model is also extended to upper-level chemistry courses , non-science major laboratory courses, and the Pre-Collegiate Development program for minority students who are planning to attend a college or university. \r\n\r\nCoupling discovery-based experiments with inquiry/problem-based experiments (tandem experiments) enhances conceptual understanding and critical reasoning skills and increases student interest and involvement in the laboratory. The laboratory transformation leads to additional team building and cooperation among the faculty who construct the program and who instruct the lecture courses that accompany the laboratory sections. Materials are available on CD, web pages and in publications.",
