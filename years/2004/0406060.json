Lee,  University of Washington\r\n\r\nThe Neumann Problem for the Tangential Cauchy-Riemann Complex and the CR\r\nEmbedding Problem\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\nTechnical description of the project:\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will study existence and regularity theorems for the\r\nnatural Neumann boundary problem for the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations\r\non smoothly bounded domains in CR manifolds.  All known existence results\r\nfor this problem work only on domains with very special defining functions,\r\nnamely those that depend only on the real and imaginary parts of a single\r\nCR-holomorphic function.  The key idea of this research is to use the fact\r\nthat such a defining function provides a codimension-2 foliation (near the\r\nboundary but away from characteristic points) by compact CR-submanifolds.\r\nBy using known estimates for the Kohn Laplacian on the compact leaves, one\r\ncan reduce the Neumann problem to a (generally non-coercive) elliptic\r\nboundary problem in a plane domain.  These results are expected to have\r\napplications to such problems as the local CR embedding problem, local\r\ndeformations of CR structures, characterizing domains on which the\r\ntangential Cauchy-Riemann complex is solvable, regularity of maps between CR\r\nmanifolds, and the existence of local frames for CR vector bundles.\r\n\r\nNon-technical description:\r\n\r\nThe geometry of complex manifolds (geometric objects in which complex\r\nnumbers instead of real numbers can be used as coordinates) has recently\r\nbegun to play a surprisingly important role in both mathematics and physics.\r\nFor example, in string theory, physicists postulate that the fundamental\r\nparticles of matter are actually \"quantum strings\" that vibrate inside\r\nsub-microscopic complex manifolds called Calabi-Yau manifolds.  The\r\nprincipal analytic tool for studying complex manifolds is the Cauchy-Riemann\r\nequations, a system of partial differential equations that characterizes,\r\namong other things, those functions that have complex derivatives.  When one\r\nstudies surfaces within complex manifolds (such as the \"branes\" that arise\r\nin string theory), the Cauchy-Riemann equations need to be replaced by a\r\nmuch more complicated system called the \"tangential Cauchy-Riemann\r\nequations,\" which we are just beginning to understand.  This proposal will\r\ndevelop new techniques for studying some deep analytic questions surrounding\r\nthe solvability of the tangential Cauchy-Riemann equations, which are\r\nexpected to be of fundamental importance in understanding the geometry and\r\nanalysis of surfaces in complex manifolds.\r\n\r\n",
