 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry  program supports work by Professor Daniel J. Mindiola at Indiana University to explore the chemistry of three- and four-coordinate titanium complexes having metal-ligand multiple bonds.  The research involves the synthesis, structure, reactivity, and kinetic studies of a four-coordinate titanium(IV) alkylidene, imide, and phosphinidene complexes. Topics addressed include bonding considerations and mechanistic and reactivity studies of titanium alkylidene, imide, and phosphinidene systems.  Investigations extend to group 5 complexes and redox studies stemming from vanadium complexes containing metal-ligand multiple bonds. \r\n\r\nSpecific targets of the project are to: i) Prepare low-coordinate and high-oxidation state early-transition metal complexes containing metal-ligand multiple bonds.  ii) Explore the reactivity of these unique systems and compare catalytic activity with well-established systems.  iii) Expand this synthetic methodology to the preparation of low-coordinate group 3 and 5 transition metals.  iv) Through retro-analytical concept mapping and self-assessment techniques, recruit undergraduate students in basic science-oriented research.  v) Implement two student-based chapters at Indiana University for the recruitment of minority groups into the physical sciences. \r\n\r\nThis work aims toward new catalysts by exploring new transition metal complexes with multiple bonds.  The education plan is to develop undergraduate research awareness and implementation of student-based chapters for the recruitment of undergraduates (especially from underrepresented groups) into the physical sciences.  \r\n",
