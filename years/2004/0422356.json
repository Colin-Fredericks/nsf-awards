 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is enhancing the learning opportunities for low income, academically talented students by offering forty (40) scholarships annually through the \r\nComputer Science, Mathematics, and Technology (CMT) Academic Rewards Program.  Objectives include increasing the number of members of under-represented groups majoring in CMT, increasing retention to degree completion, encouraging academic success through developing a learning community cohort with tutoring and mentoring, and enhancing partnerships with area industry and institutions of higher education to ensure increased transfer rates and employment opportunities for Scholars. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit.  A CMT Project Advisory Team comprised of faculty, staff, and industry representatives is responsible for recruiting eligible applicants, selecting scholars, ensuring their success through mentoring and access to support services, and providing guidance on maintaining and enhancing program activities.  College support provided to the scholars includes recruitment, advising, an array of student support services and career placement.  The scholars are part of an active learning community cohort designed to help them succeed as students and later as professionals.\r\n \r\nBroader Impacts.  The program is resulting in an overall increase in retention, graduation, and transfer rates of CMT students and increasing the numbers of students and graduates from underrepresented populations entering CMT careers.  The project has a long-term benefit to society by filling jobs in high demand areas and increasing the successful entry of women and minorities into these fields. \r\n",
