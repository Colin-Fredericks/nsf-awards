The  widely  used  steel-reinforced  concrete  (RC)  structures  are  normally  massive  and  complex  and  are  subjected  to  harsh environment for a rather long service life. The leading cause of degradation of RC structures is corrosion damage to the rebar embedded in the concrete. Additional corrosion induces cracks leading to debonding of the rebar. This form of deterioration in RC structures often outweighs other forms of deterioration. Despite the  potential  damages,  and  sometimes  potentially  catastrophic  ones,  an  efficient  and  effective  structural health monitoring system (SHMS) that provides quantitative information of damage inside RC structures is still  lacking.  It  is  clear  that  a  robust  monitoring  system  needs  to  be  developed  to  provide  timely maintenance action and safety for civil structures. \r\nThe  objective  of  this  research  is  to  develop  an  active  distributed  sensing  system  for  quantifying  and visualizing location and sizing of embedded damage in RC structures in real time. The work goes beyond a simple monitoring system; it merely detects the presence of damage without identifying its importance on the safety of the structure.  \r\nThe proposed work builds on a proof-of-concept study in which the PI demonstrated the identification of \r\ndifferent sizes and shapes of damages and their locations in metals utilizing migration technique, which is \r\nwidely used in geophysical exploration. In that work, a linear array of piezoelectric patches analogous to \r\nthe geophones was used in the experiments as actuators and sensors. With  this  preliminary  success  in  homogeneous  plates,  the  proposed  research  aims  at  quantifying  the damage in highly inhomogeneous RC structures, in particular the corrosion and crack-induced debonding of the rebars from the concrete using a distributed piezo actuator/FBG sensor network. Excitation signals will be emitted from piezo actuators, either mounted on the concrete or on the rebars; low-cost and reliable optical fiber distributed sensors will be embedded in the concrete to provide dynamic strain sensing along their lengths for reinforced concrete. \r\n\r\nThe research plan consists of four major tasks. Namely: \r\n\t Development  of  a  robust  and  real-time  prestack  migration  technique  using  ray  theory  for  wave propagation modeling and scattering; \r\n\t Laboratory measurements of physical models of prototype RC structures; \r\n\tDetermination of sensitivity of corrosion/debonding to selective diagnostic signals and to piezo and optical fiber placement; \r\n\tDevelopment of signal processing techniques and imaging visualization algorithms for unambiguous identification in location and sizing of the damages with high resolution. \r\nThis study will identify and address basic scientific and engineering challenges toward establishing SHMS \r\nin RC structures. The proposed research will lay the groundwork for the future use of a distributed piezo \r\nactuator/FBG sensor network for damage identification and continuous  monitoring using  migration \r\ntechnique.  It  is  envisioned  that  the  proposed  work  will  significantly  advance  scientific  knowledge  in  the  areas  of sensor technology, stress  wave simulation, innovative  migration technique, damage reconstruction and visualization,  and  laboratory  methodologies  with  stress  wave measurements.  Developed  knowledge  and methodologies  will  be  integrated  into  education  via  development  of  relevant  courses  and  professional workshops.  \r\n\r\nThrough involvement of undergraduate students in the experimental  work in the laboratory testing and \r\nanalysis, the graduate research work will be integrated with undergraduate program. Through existing ties \r\nwith North Carolina A&T University, a historically black university, effort will be made to attract female \r\nand  minority  students  in  performing  the  proposed  research.  Moreover,  through  an  existing  Industrial \r\nPartnership Program in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, industrial partners will \r\nbe involved as members of the graduate thesis committee in other relevant work. \r\n",
