 "awd_abstract_narration": "Matrix computations are ubiquitous in scientific and engineering applications.\r\nThe existence of high-quality algorithms and resulting software packages, such as\r\nLAPACK and MATLAB, greatly alleviates the burden on scientists and engineers, allowing\r\nthem to devote their energy to the particular application at hand.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is addressed towards identifying and solving some novel and fundamental matrix\r\nproblems that arise in modern applications. The last decade has\r\nseen significant advances in communications technology and infrastructure;\r\nprime examples are the world-wide web, wireless computing and sensor networks.\r\nThese modern applications lead to a vast variety of interesting problems --- these range\r\nfrom complex design constructions, data warehousing and retrieval problems, to the need for \r\nintelligent analysis of huge amounts of data. As a response to these needs,\r\nmany new matrix problems arise that need to be solved robustly and efficiently.\r\n\r\nSome of the most challenging problems in the analyses of large data matrices are the\r\nrelated problems of clustering, co-clustering (simultaneous clustering\r\nof rows and columns), and matrix approximations. In many applications, the data\r\nis not Gaussian, and hence traditional techniques, such as singular value\r\ndecomposition (SVD) and classical Euclidean k-means are often inadequate.\r\nThe proposed project formulates new matrix approximation problems related to\r\nco-clustering: these formulations appeal to a generalized maximum entropy principle\r\nto search for structured matrix approximations that arise naturally for an important\r\nclass of statistical distributions, known as exponential families. The aim of the\r\nproject is to develop the theory as well as robust, numerical software for these\r\nmatrix computations.\r\n\r\nAnother important class of problems contains varied inverse problems: given\r\na set of desirable properties, construct a data matrix that satisfies these properties.\r\nSuch inverse problems arise in diverse applications, such as the design of\r\nkernel similarity matrices for statistical learning and the design of Gram matrices\r\nwith low cross-correlations for wireless communications. The plan is to\r\nuse alternate projection schemes, and numerical optimization to solve such design\r\nproblems. The outcome of the project would be a unified framework for these inverse\r\nproblems, including modeling, algorithms and software.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that there will be two broad research impacts of the proposed project.\r\nThe first contribution would be to applied mathematics and computer science\r\n--- the formulation and proposed solutions of the novel matrix problems that\r\narise naturally in applications. It is hoped that the proposed work will vitalize the\r\nsearch for better algorithms, and further deepen the connections between applied mathematics\r\nand engineering.  The second contribution would be to the applications themselves. Posing particular\r\napplication tasks in terms of well-defined matrix problems should lead to faster\r\nand more reliable methods.\r\n\r\nThe project will support the graduate education of 2 or 3 students. These students will be trained in the\r\nmultidisciplinary areas of computational linear algebra, data mining, statistical pattern recognition and \r\nwireless computing. Specialized courses in all these areas are available in the Computer Science,\r\nApplied Mathematics and Electrical & Computer Engineering departments at UT Austin.\r\nSuch a broad education will fill the need for substantial academic and industrial demand in these\r\nmultidisciplinary areas for educated personnel.\r\nThe project will also support research experience for one undergraduate, and a conscious effort\r\nwill be made to recruit women and minority students.\r\nResults of the project will be published in the linear algebra, data-mining, and information theory\r\nliteratures, contributing to each of these areas as well as their cross-fertilization.\r\nData and software developed under the project will be shared with the scientific community\r\nvia a public web site.\r\n",
