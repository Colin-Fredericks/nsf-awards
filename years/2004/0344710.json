 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research aims to identify the genes responsible for adaptive coloration in natural populations of beach mice (Peromyscus polionotus).  Beach mice are an extremely pale relative of the darker inland forms.  This reduction in pigmentation is an adaptation for camouflage, as these mice inhabit the light-colored sand dunes of barrier islands off the coast of Florida and Alabama.  The goal of this study is to be able to use both patterns of gene expression and genetic mapping to identify genetic regions that are responsible for adaptive color differences between island and mainland populations.  A second goal is to understand how these genes interact to produce coat color patterns.  Together, these results will shed light on the genetic basis of adaptation and the role of gene interactions in complex morphological evolution of natural populations.\r\n\r\nBecause the relationship between color variation and natural selection is straightforward in this system, the proposed work is expected to be an appealing example of the genetics of adaptation and to have an impact on the biological community as well as be accessible to society in general.  In addition, the integrative nature of this project highlights the utility of combining ecological, evolutionary and genetic research to understand biological diversity.  Finally, the P.I. and current graduate students are all female, and thus this project incorporates researchers traditionally underrepresented in evolutionary biology.\r\n",
