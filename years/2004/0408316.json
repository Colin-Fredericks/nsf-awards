 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social Cognitive Neuroscience (SCN) is an emerging interdisciplinary field that integrates the theories and methods of social psychology and cognitive neuroscience.  As such, it represents a new means for social psychologists to build and test theories of the psychological and neural mechanisms that underpin phenomena of long standing interest to the field, including person perception, motivation, self perception, and self regulation.  Although interest in SCN is growing rapidly, there have been few forums for social psychologists to learn about the proper and effective use of neuroscience techniques to answer social psychological questions, and to participate in discussion about the promise of this field with individuals who already have gained SCN expertise.  To address this concern, a SCN preconference has been organized to serve both as a forum for current researchers to discuss central issues, and as a platform for new researchers to learn about effective ways in which SCN research can be conducted.  To meet these goals, presentations will 1) examine the proper interpretation of functional imaging and neuropsychological data, 2) present current research that illustrates the proper use of neuroscience methods, and 3) consider the current and future promise of SCN.  This preconference will precede the January 2004 meeting of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology, the field's largest meeting, which will enable interested researchers from all areas of social psychology and all careers stages to attend.  This grant provides support for initial an inaugural SCN preconference, which may help establish support for a self-sustaining preconference in the future.\r\n",
