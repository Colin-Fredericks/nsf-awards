 "awd_abstract_narration": "This FRG project is a collaborative effort between researchers at U. TX, Austin, Harvard U., and U. VA. The project addresses materials science based approaches to achieving high-performance laser diodes in the high-energy visible region: (1) growth and characterization of III-P-based wide-bandgap self-assembled quantum dots(SAQD) composed of direct-bandgap ternary alloys, e.g., InxGa1-xP on GaAs substrates, and (2) growth of InxAl1-xP ( x = 0.6 to ~1.0) quantum dots on GaP substrates. These SAQD materials and lasers will be studied to generate the basic knowledge required to optimize such structures for optoelectronic applications such as light sources emitting in the green and yellow spectral regions for full-color laser displays, sources for holographic memory storage, and high-speed light sources for low-cost plastic-fiber-based optical communications systems. The research strives for fundamental insight into the physics of two-dimensionally confined systems in III-V materials. The growth and properties of III-phosphide quantum dots will be explored and the control of strain will be employed to develop an understanding of the growth of uniform QD arrays. \r\n%%% \r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. Experimental tools are now available to allow atomic level observation of elementary surface processes which when better understood allow advances in fundamental science and technology. The results of this work may allow a new level of reliable control of materials growth, allowing semiconductor devices with reproducible properties to be attained in a variety of academic and commercial settings. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. The project involves the collaborative work of students and faculty in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Physics, and Materials.\r\n*** \r\n",
