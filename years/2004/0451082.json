Henson\r\nInstitution:  University of Massachusetts/Amherst\r\nProposal Number: 0451082\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nThe Chemical Process Control (CPC) conference series is aimed at reviewing and assessing the current state of process control technology.  Consistent with this goal, the conference has been held every five years since 1976.  All oral presentations are by invitation only to ensure that the conference themes are covered in a consistent fashion by internationally renowned researchers.  The CPC VII conference will take place January 8-13, 2006 in Lake Louise, Alberta, Canada.  This grant is to defray travel and conference expenses of the invited academic speakers.\r\n\r\nThe goal of CPC VII is to provide an open form for discussing the current state and future needs of process control research and education.  Since the initial conference, the term \"process control\" has been interpreted in an increasingly broad sense.  In addition to sessions on traditional chemical process control topics, CPC VII will address emerging applications areas including microchemical and fuel cell systems, multiscale systems, information and enterprise systems and systems biology.  The theme of the meeting is \"Assessment of Core Technologies and Emerging Applications.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\nBetter process control should lead to more efficient operation of chemical, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, etc. manufacturing facilities, which should benefit the US economy.  The interaction of academics, industrial practitioners and government officials should advance process control research and education.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
