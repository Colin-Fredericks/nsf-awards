 "awd_abstract_narration": "DNA polymerases that replicate cellular genomes do so with astonishing accuracy in all organisms, using a variety of fidelity-enforcing and proofreading mechanisms. However, these same mechanisms typically prevent replication past rare damages (lesions) in DNA template strands, risking cell death. Recently, new families of relaxed-fidelity polymerases, able to synthesis DNA past lesions, sometimes but not always with increased risk of mutation, have been discovered in all major classes of organisms. For example, in a rare human genetic disorder (xeroderma pigmentosum variant), a translesion polymerase (TLP) able to copy UV-light-damaged template strands relatively accurately is missing; these individuals suffer from high skin cancer rates. Plants encode four TLPs highly similar to those in microbes and mammals, and recent studies suggest important roles in plant genomic stability. The various evolutionarily conserved TLP families each show different broad specificities for poorly defined sets of DNA lesions - so-called cognate lesions. The central hypothesis guiding this project is that among the cognate lesions identified with each TLP family, evolution will have shaped the specificities of the family members in particular organisms towards DNA lesions that the organism is likely to encounter. Because of their obligatory prolonged exposure to sunlight, and their oxygen-synthesizing (chloroplast) and \"breathing\" (mitochondrial) metabolism, plants seem likely to be impacted by UV-induced photoproducts and oxidized bases. In separate sets of biochemical experiments, purified microbial, human, and plant (Arabidopsis) TLPs, from four families, will be compared with respect to the efficiency and accuracy of DNA synthesis past UV-induced and\r\noxidative lesions. In parallel, responses of Arabidopsis mutants lacking each of the TLPs to UV-light and oxidative-stress, and thus the respective contributions of the TLPs to plant genomic stability will be analyzed.\r\n",
