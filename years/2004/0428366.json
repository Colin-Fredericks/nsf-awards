 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Small Sensor Team (SST)/Collaborative Research project is to significantly improve the observability in polymer processing operations by providing feedback of pressure, temperature, flow rate, and other process states at multiple locations within the mold cavity, for real-time process and quality control. This objective will be achieved through simultaneous in-mold pressure-temperature sensing, multi-domain signal processing, and injection molding process analysis.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of this research is that it will introduce a new generation of miniaturized sensors that can be placed at practically anywhere within the mold cavity that are previously not possible, and in much less time than previously required to modify a mold for placing a conventional sensor. The broader impact of this research is three-fold: 1) it represents a radical step forward from the current wired sensors that have been used for decades, and has the potential to significantly improve molding productivity wherein each percentage point improvement corresponds to cost savings over $40 million per year, 2) the new sensing technique will not only be applicable to injection molding, but also to other high-energy manufacturing processes, and 3) the research will contribute substantially to multidisciplinary education and training of graduate and undergraduate students and enhance manufacturing curriculum development  at the PIs' institutions.",
