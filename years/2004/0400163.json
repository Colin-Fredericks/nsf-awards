 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal addresses problems in model theory of o-minimal structures. The\r\nprincipal investigator will continue further developing model theory and\r\nanalytic geometry associated with o-minimal structures. In developing model\r\ntheory of o-minimal structures the principal investigator is planning to use\r\ndifferential-geometric techniques. In turn the principal investigator hopes\r\nto apply model-theoretic techniques to questions in complex and real\r\nanalytic geometries. Model theory of compact complex manifolds has had\r\nremarkable success in the recent years and the proposer plans, among the\r\nother things, to extend these advances, using methods developed by him and\r\nhis collaborators. \r\n\r\nThe proposal is in in a branch of mathematical logic called model theory.\r\nModel theory studies mathematical structures by considering the first-order\r\nsentences true in those structures, and the family of alternate structures\r\nthat also satisfy all of those first-order sentences. (Sentences in logic\r\nare built out of a small repertoire of elements and constructions.\r\n\"First-order\" refers to the number of quantifiers in a sentence, a measure\r\nof complexity.) In many cases these alternative structures illuminate some\r\nproperties of the original mathematical objects. \r\nA good example is the non-standard analysis. A part of this proposal is an\r\nextension on ideas of non-standard analysis to complex-analytic functions. \r\n",
