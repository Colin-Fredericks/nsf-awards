Model selection for semiparametric regression\r\nmodels consists of two components: model selection (such as choice of\r\nsmoothing parameters) for the nonparametric component, and variable selection\r\nfor the parametric portion. Traditional variable selection\r\nschemes, such as the stepwise deletion and the best subset variable\r\nselection, could be extended to semiparametric modeling, but they are\r\nexpensive in computation since they require the smoothing parameters to\r\nbe selected for each submodel. The objectives of this proposal are to\r\ndevelop new widely applicable model selection procedures for three\r\nclasses of semiparametric models which provide a unified framework for\r\nmany existing semiparametric regression models in the literature. In this\r\nproposal, the PI (a) studies the asymptotic behaviors of the proposed\r\nestimators, (b) demonstrates how the rate of convergence of the resulting\r\nestimator depends on the regularization parameter, (c) shows that the proposed\r\nprocedures perform as well as the oracle procedure in variable selection\r\nfor semiparametric regression models, and (d) addresses issues related to\r\nimplementation of the proposed procedures. The PI also examines finite\r\nsample performance via extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies and\r\napplies the proposed procedures to analysis of real data.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith modern data collection devices and vast data storage space, one can\r\neasily collect high-dimensional data, such as biotech data, financial data,\r\nsatellite imagery and hyperspectral imagery. Analysis of high-dimensional\r\ndata poses many challenges for statisticians and is becoming the most\r\nimportant research topic in statistics. This proposal (a) lays down\r\na well-grounded and comprehensive framework for model selection for\r\nsemiparametric regression modeling in high-dimensional data analysis,\r\n(b) has significant impact on the future research of high-dimensional\r\nstatistical modeling, and (c) enhances significantly the availability\r\nof statistical tools and software for high-dimensional statistical modeling.\r\nThe proposed work is incorporated into a new topic course from which\r\ngraduate students may directly benefit. The proposed work also\r\nbenefits a broad range of scientists and researchers in various fields, including\r\nautomotive engineering, medical studies, prevention studies, public health\r\nand social sciences.\r\n",
