Biogeochemical cycling within the hyporheic zone can significantly affect the flux of elements and chemical compounds between groundwater and surface waters.  This proposal leverages existing USGS infrastructure and current NSF STC activities to monitor (1) a more extensive array of redox active species and (2) more spatially and temporally dense patterns of nitrogen species using a novel sensor network deployment.  Project personnel will analyze hyporheic zone porewater samples for a range of trace elements not being considered by USGS, such as rare earth elements, uranium, and arsenic.  A parallel effort will deploy a continuous hyporheic zone sensor network targeting nitrogen redox species.  This network will be deployed adjacent to the USGS manual sampling station, and will include commercial nitrate, nitrite and ammonium sensors and developmental nitrate microsensors, and will enhance the spatial resolution and add temporal resolution to the overall investigation.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit.  While it is generally understood that groundwater-surface water interactions play an important role in determining sediment and water quality in streams, a quantitative understanding of the chemical flux and biogeochemistry has been lacking for most elements and chemical compounds.

The species and trends identified will yield new insight into the biogeochemistry of the hyporheic zone and its capacity to buffer groundwater-surface water interactions.
