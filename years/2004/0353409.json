 "awd_abstract_narration": "Education Development Center proposes a four-year project, \"Fostering Geometric Thinking in the Middle Grades (FGT),\" to develop a research-based professional development curriculum focused on geometric thinking in the middle grades, which will serve teachers in grades 5 through 9.  FGT will confront a major national education challenge:  On the TIMMS international comparisons, U.S. eighth-grade students' weakest performances were in the areas of geometry and measurement.  Furthermore, at the end of grade 12, the U.S. scores in geometry were the lowest of all participating countries.  To meet this challenge, FGT will (1) expand the research knowledge base on students' geometric thinking, teachers' understanding of geometric thinking, and their application of this understanding to the classroom; and (2) add to the research base on the design of effective models of professional development for teachers. \r\n\r\nFGT will meet these goals by working with nearly 220 teachers in grades 5-9 and developing: \r\nA Framework designed to help teachers better understand geometric thinking and how it develops in learners;\r\nA Curriculum for professional development in geometry based on this framework; Quantitative and qualitative studies of the impact of the curriculum; and  Research reports disseminating the results of this work. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
