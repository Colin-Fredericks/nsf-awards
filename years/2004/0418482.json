 "awd_abstract_narration": "POLITICAL BUDGET CYCLES\r\n\r\nThis purpose of this project is to study fluctuations in fiscal policy\r\ninduced by the election cycle from both a theoretical and empirical\r\nperspective. Conventional wisdom is that incumbents use economic policy,\r\nespecially fiscal policy, before elections to influence electoral\r\noutcomes, with electoral considerations often seen as a key factor in\r\npolicymaking around elections.  Among economists, however, opinion is\r\ndivided. One view is that fiscal expansion is indeed used in election\r\nyears in many countries to generate desired economic and hence electoral\r\neffects, the other is that fiscal manipulation is punished rather than\r\nrewarded at the polls.\r\n\r\nRecent work of by the PI suggests that the nature of political budget\r\ncycles depends on the experience of the voters with the electoral\r\nsystem. What accounts for these differences between new and established\r\ndemocracies? Is deficit spending electorally rewarded in the first group\r\nbut punished in the second? What are the characteristics of new\r\ndemocracies that may explain the strength of the budget cycle. \r\nEspecially important here is the information voters have about fiscal\r\nmagnitudes. Drazen proposes several ways to measure this, including fiscal\r\ntransparency indices. The project will attempt to compare this\r\nexplanation with others, such as the fluidity of voting patterns or the\r\ngreater amount of rent-seeking that it is argued may characterize new\r\ndemocracies. The project also studies why experienced voters respond to\r\nelection-year economics, focusing on the importance of the amount of\r\ninformation they have when they enter the voting booth. \r\n",
