 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three decades after the establishment of QCD as the theory of quarks and\r\ngluons, understanding QCD works remains one of the great puzzles in\r\nnuclear physics. A major challenge arises from the fact that the degrees\r\nof freedom observed in Nature are bound objects composed of quarks (and\r\ngluons): hadrons such as protons and neutrons.  The remarkable and\r\nunique feature of QCD at large distances --- quark confinement ---\r\nprevents the individual quark and gluon constituents making up a\r\nhadronic bound state to be removed from the system and examined in\r\nisolation. As a corollary, quarks move with relativistic speeds inside\r\nthe hadrons and this motion makes up 99.9\\% of the human mass.\r\n\r\nAt the other extreme, the property of QCD known as asymptotic freedom,\r\nin which quarks interact weakly at (very) short distances, allows one to\r\neasily describe certain properties of hadrons and atomic nuclei at\r\nextremely high energies in terms of quarks and gluons.\r\n\r\nDespite the apparent differences between the hadronic and quark-gluon\r\nregimes, in Nature there exist instances where the behavior of\r\nlow-energy hadronic cross sections, averaged over appropriate energy\r\nintervals, closely resembles that at asymptotically high energies,\r\ncalculated in terms of quark-gluon degrees of freedom.  This phenomenon\r\nis referred to as quark-hadron duality, and reflects the relationship\r\nbetween confinement and asymptotic freedom in QCD. Surprisingly, this\r\nphenomenon already takes place at rather low energies and averaged over\r\nrelatively small energy intervals (or a few hadronic states). This\r\nproposal investigates electron scattering reactions off protons,\r\nneutrons and nuclei in an effort to understand the origin of this\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe proposal encompasses several experiments scattering electrons off a\r\nproton target to push and understand the limits where quark-hadron\r\nduality arises. It also includes the development of a novel detector to\r\nas closely as possible mimic an experiment scattering electrons off a\r\nneutron target.  According to many theories the different onset of\r\nquark-hadron duality for protons and neutrons will point to the origin\r\nof the duality phenomenon.  Lastly, interesting questions also arise in\r\natomic nuclei: does a proton bound in a nucleus change structure due to\r\nits underlying quark-gluon structure? Within QCD, there is no way to\r\nderive anything like a nucleus in which the constituents (in normal\r\nlife, the protons and neutrons) do not change as the mean density\r\nincreases. Similarly, can one witness the underlying quark-gluon\r\nstructure of hadrons when they traverse a nucleus?\r\n\r\nThe proposing physicists have spearheaded the research thrust of\r\nquark-hadron duality and more generally the transition between the\r\nhadronic and quark-gluon descriptions of protons and nuclei. The\r\napproved project will allow this research to come to fruition and will\r\nsimultaneously provide advanced, internationally-competitive, scientific\r\ntraining for underrepresented minorities. Two of the proposers, and two\r\nPh.D. students, are female.  In addition, one of the students is\r\nAfro-american and two are African.",
