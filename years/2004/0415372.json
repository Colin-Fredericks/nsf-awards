 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Division of Materials Research provides partial support for a Gordon Research Conference on Aqueous Corrosion to be held on July 25-30 at Colby-Sawyer College in New London, NH. With this award, Professor Scully will organize a conference, the theme of which will be \"Progress, Needs, and Opportunities in Aqueous Corrosion Science\". The broader objective of this conference is to stimulate exchange information and ideas among scientists and educators on a number of recent advances in understanding the field of metal corrosion and the transitions of these processes from pits to cracks. In addition, corrosion prevention by coatings and additives, multiscale modeling on the corrosion mechanisms, and microstructural and nanoscale aspects of corrosion are some of the other topics to be discussed. This conference will be discussing an important topic of current interest, when many communities are facing the presence of lead in drinking water by corrosion.  Hence, science involved and how to prevent this are of great importance. A number of educators, researchers and students are expected to present their studies, and the NSF support would be used primarily to support students, speakers and young faculty and scientists.",
