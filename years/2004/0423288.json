The Turkish organizer is Dr. Okyay Kaynak, Electrical Engineering Department at Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey.  Topics to be covered in the first meeting include: design, modeling and simulation, distributed systems, fault detection, vision and sensors, vibration and control, computational intelligence, intelligent transportation systems and embedded real-time systems.  Topics to be covered in the second meeting include: adaptive control, aerospace control, signal processing and algorithms, automotive control, computing and communications, decentralized control, discrete event systems, fuzzy systems, hybrid systems and neural networks.  Special panels will discuss collaboration between US and Turkish scientists.  Special effort has been made to include four Iraqi scientists in the meetings, and to discuss possible U.S.-Iraqi and U.S.-Iraqi/Turkish collaboration in these areas.\r\n\r\nScope:  The purpose of the conferences is to provide an international forum for the dissemination of knowledge and experience on research, education and training in the fields of mechatronics, control and automation. The papers to be presented are expected to address the recent advances and also the future perspectives as well as possible cooperation between various individuals and institutions.  The project will support the participation of eight US scientists, including one junior scientist, and also one US graduate student, in the workshop and in the conferences.  It will also allow for participation of four scientists from Iraq in these meetings.  The topics and development to be covered in the meetings are quite extensive and are quite relevant in many fields of applications in industry, medicine, aviation as well as commerce. Following the workshop, the organizers expect to provide a set of recommendations for areas of potential cooperation among the three countries.",
