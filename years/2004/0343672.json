 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project abstract:\r\n\r\nThis project involves an integrated collection of research and\r\neducational activities focused on the theory of error-correcting\r\ncodes. Error-correcting codes are combinatorial objects used for the\r\npurpose of reliable communication of information over a noisy\r\nchannel. The project focuses on the asymptotic and algorithmic aspects\r\nof coding theory, and in particular aims to construct explicit\r\nfamilies of codes that achieve good trade-offs together with efficient\r\nalgorithms for encoding and decoding them. The channel noise is\r\ntypically modeled adversarially (as opposed to being generated by some\r\nprobability distribution), as this will yield codes and algorithms\r\nwith the strongest possible error-resilience guarantees.\r\n\r\nThe central technical notion that will be explored is that of \"list\r\ndecoding\". Under list decoding, the decoder is supposed to output all\r\nmessages whose encodings are within a certain distance of the received\r\nword. Thus one relaxes the requirement that the decoder's answer\r\nalways be unique. This relaxation is necessary to meaningfully pose\r\nthe question of decoding beyond the ``traditional'' half-the-distance\r\nbound, and at the same time even when constrained to output a small\r\nlist, ends up permitting decoding well beyond half-the-distance of a\r\ncode. List decoding is itself an old notion (first defined in the late\r\n50's) but it was only recently that efficient list decoding\r\nalgorithms were discovered for useful families of codes. Consequently,\r\nthough much progress has been made in the last few years, list\r\ndecoding is a subject still in its infancy in terms of its true\r\npotential. In particular, the high level conceptual motivation for\r\nlist decoding is that it will enable communication at rates close to\r\nthe channel's ``capacity'' even when the noise is adversarial (instead\r\nof obeying an assumed probabilistic model). The codes needed for such\r\na result are, however, not explicitly known currently. One of the\r\ncentral goals of this project is to make progress towards the\r\nconstruction of such codes and the associated list decoding\r\nalgorithms.\r\n\r\nBROAD IMPACTS: The project will attempt to provide new tools and\r\ntechniques for the study of codes that involve a rare interplay\r\nbetween algebra, combinatorics, and probability. It will try to\r\nenhance our understanding of the fundamental limits of noiseless\r\ncommunication possible on various noisy channels, as well as push the\r\nrate of usage of transmission channels in practice much closer to\r\ntheir true potential even in the face of adversarially effected\r\nerrors. Due to the great diversity in the results that it aims to\r\nobtain, the research will enable bringing the different communities\r\nthat work on coding theory closer together, and more widely expound\r\nthe merits of the asymptotic complexity based approach pioneered by\r\ntheoretical computer science. Lecture notes from the offerings of the\r\ncourses developed in the educational component will be made freely\r\navailable on the web, and will eventually be embellished into a\r\nmonograph on coding theory with a focus on computational complexity\r\nthat is currently lacking in the standard texts.\r\n\r\n",
