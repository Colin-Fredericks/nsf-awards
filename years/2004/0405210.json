David Forbes of the University of South Alabama and his UK counterpart, Robert Stockman, propose to conduct chemical studies of sulfur ylides and apply their methodologies to medicinally important compounds. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  Undergraduates at Alabama will participate in several research projects during three-month stays in East Anglia.  They will focus on the use of chiral sulfinyl imines as receptors using a methylidene transfer approach and stidy sulfur ylides in model systems.  The research project's ultimate goal is to develop a complete synthesis of a system of biological and medicinal importance. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  This international collaboration is highly complementary and combines the expertise of investigators in synthetic organic chemistry and their different synthetic methodologies.  It also provides an international research and training experience to undergraduate researchers from a predominantly undergraduate US institution in an EPSCoR state.\r\n",
