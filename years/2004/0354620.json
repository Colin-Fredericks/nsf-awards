Uniformization of compact and noncompact Kaehler manifolds,\r\n     combining Kaehler-Ricci flow and the study of holomorphic \r\nfunctions/sections.\r\n     2. Analysis of singularities, formulation of weak solutions, and flow past\r\n     singularities for geometric evolution equations and the duality between\r\n     the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow.\r\n     3. Study of harmonic/holomorphic functions, function theory, spectrum\r\n     and the geometry of complete Riemannian/Kaehler manifolds.\r\n     4. Existence of Einstein and other canonical Riemannian metrics on \r\nmanifolds.\r\n\r\n     Geometric evolution equations are powerful and central tools in the study\r\n     of the global geometry and topology of manifolds. Recent work of Perelman\r\n     on Hamilton's program for Ricci flow and its applications towards a \r\npossible\r\n     solution to the Poincare and geometrization conjectures provides a timely\r\n     and promising opportunity for a group effort on significant advancements\r\n     in geometric analysis and related areas. The results from the project \r\nshould\r\n     lead to new advances in and connections between string/duality theory and\r\n     renormalization group flow, Ricci flow, mean curvature flow and other\r\n     geometric evolution equations, and may enhance the understanding of the\r\n     homogeneity of the universe at large scales, as well as other areas in \r\nscience.\r\n     The project will enhance the understanding of geometric analysis, \r\nlinear and\r\n     nonlinear partial differential equations, algebraic geometry and \r\nmathematical\r\n     physics.\r\n",
