 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rosenberg, Aronld\r\nUniversity of Massachusetts Amherst\r\nCCF-0342417\r\n\r\nThe past decade has seen a paradigm shift in the computing platforms used for a wide variety of computations.  Advances in technology and economic considerations have made clusters of workstations or pc's a viable medium for high-performance \"collaborative'' computing (wherein many computers cooperate to solve a single computational problem).  Many of the algorithmic devices that ensured efficient \"collaborative'' computing in earlier computing environments no longer guarantee efficiency within such clusters, especially when the clusters are heterogeneous, in the sense that their workstations may differ in computational power.  The program of research proposed herein is dedicated to achieving provably efficient computation in heterogeneous clusters, via efficient algorithms for large classes of important computations.  The first component of the goal of  \"provably efficient computation'' will be the use of a combination of analytical and experimental methods to develop the insights needed to craft scheduling algorithms whose performance is predictable via rigorous mathematical and/or statistical analyses.  The second component of the goal will be to validate the abstract models used to formulate and analyze algorithms.  Implementations of algorithms on actual clusters, and comparison of measured performance against the predictions of the abstract algorithmic models, will be used to validate or, where necessary, to modify the models.  The scheduling algorithms and, when appropriate, implementations thereof that result from this process will be the main product of the research.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will focus on \"ad hoc'' clusters, which are assembled from  \"off the shelf'' workstations or pc's, interconnected via local-area networks.  The major scheduling challenges here reside in the substantial cost of interworkstation communication and in the cluster's (likely) heterogeneity, i.e., the differences in computing power of its constituent workstations.  Initial studies have led to a mathematical framework for the proposed research.\r\n\r\nTechnical impact.. The proposed work will provide rigorously validated guidelines for\r\nscheduling a broad variety of significant computational problems efficiently on heterogeneous clusters.  Research results will be disseminated in leading conferences and journals, and will be\r\nincorporated into courses and seminars.  Via the training of students, and via collaborations and technical interactions with colleagues, both in the US and abroad, the work will lead to yet further technical progress.  (There are ongoing collaborations with colleagues in Australia, France, and Italy.)\r\n\r\nBroader impacts.  Prior support from NSF has led to the incorporation of cutting-edge\r\ntechnical material into independent studies, courses, and research seminars, which have been part of the training of several generations of students in several departments at U Mass Amherst.  All but one of the PI's doctoral students have pursued (successful) academic careers at colleges or universities in the US.  Two recent doctoral students have been women: one was born in China and one in eastern Europe; both are successfully pursuing careers in US educational institutions.\r\nResults from the proposed research will be incorporated into the educational program in the same way that prior results have been.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
