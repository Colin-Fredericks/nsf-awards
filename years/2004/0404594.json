 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the past 10-15 years there have been significant developments in the\r\nareas of  applied regression and classification. Much of the impetus\r\noriginally came from outside of the field of statistics, from areas\r\nsuch as computer science, machine learning and neural networks. In some\r\ncases, statisticians have helped to synthesize these innovations, often by\r\nreinterpreting them from the point of view of standard statistical models.\r\nAs a result, we now have at our disposal a very powerful collection of\r\ntechniques for adaptive regression and classification.  These are now\r\nbeing applied to medical diagnosis, bioinformatics and genetic modeling,\r\nchemical process control, shape, handwriting, speech and face recognition,\r\nfinancial modeling, and a wide range of other important practical\r\nproblems.  In this proposal,  the investigator develops new methods for\r\n adaptive regression and classification, with particular application\r\nto problems in bioinformatics and  genomics.  One such method is  the\r\n\"fused lasso\", a technique which seeks solutions which are both sparse\r\nand  and smooth. It is designed for problems in which the features have\r\na natural ordering, e.g. in time or space. Protein mass spectometry\r\nrepresents one such area of application.\r\n\r\nIn this research, the investigator develops new statistical algorithms\r\nfor analyzing data from biological and human  experiments.  This work\r\nis part of the exploding field of \"bioinformatics\", which seeks to make\r\nsense of the huge volume of data produced by new technologies in biology\r\nand medicine. This kind of  work represents the next step after the\r\nsequencing of the human genome, and has enormous potential for societal\r\nimpact through disease prevention and treatment.\r\n",
