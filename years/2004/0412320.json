 "awd_abstract_narration": "The object of the proposed research is to characterize and understand the behavior, especially the\r\ndynamics (molecular motion), of thin-film polymers on solid surfaces. Characterization of the\r\nproperties of the polymers is crucial to an understanding of how various devices work. Ultimately,\r\nthe properties of devices containing polymers can be improved if the behavior and their roles are\r\nunderstood. These determinations become even more crucial as the size of the devices, and hence the\r\nthickness of the polymer films, becomes smaller. The properties of the very-thin polymer films will\r\nbe studied with a variety of techniques including, mainly, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy\r\n(NMR), and also modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC), Fourier-transform infra-red\r\nspectroscopy (FTIR), and other techniques. The chemical/spectroscopic results will be correlated,\r\nwhen possible, to physical property studies, such as the measurement of adhesion strength in thin\r\nfilms.                                                                                                                                                                          \r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed research is based on the understanding of the very complex\r\nphenomena in polymer thin films. Their dynamics are difficult to quantify with many of the\r\ntechniques that are applied to chemical systems because of the thinness and opacity of the surface\r\nsystems. The use of these complementary techniques will give unprecedented detail to the\r\ncharacterization of the dynamics of adsorbed polymers, especially through the use of twodimensional\r\nexchange deuterium NMR of adsorbed polymers. The segmental dynamics of the\r\npolymer chains will be interpreted in terms of distributions of correlation times and the results of the\r\ndistributions will be used to determine the state of the polymer films.                                                                  \r\nThe broader impact of this research lies in the impact of the research itself on the technology,\r\neducation and training of students, and the transfer of this knowledge to the scientific community\r\nand the public. The work to be performed will aid device makers in designing better systems for\r\nadvanced applications that include thin polymer films. These applications are in electronic materials,\r\nsensors, particle stabilization, and composites fields, to name just a few. Knowledge of how material\r\nproperties, such as adhesion, vary as a function of thickness allows the prediction and, indeed,\r\navoidance of failure of these devices. The students educated through this research will be exposed to\r\na wide variety of experiences, often from synthesis through the measurement of mechanical\r\nproperties. They will develop an invaluable interdisciplinary background that will assist in making\r\nthem more effective employees in complex technological fields. The scientific community and\r\npublic at-large will also benefit through the activities of the PI in professional societies focused on\r\nimproving and disseminating knowledge. This includes strong components of public outreach. In\r\naddition, the PI's scientific activities will enhance his own outreach to the community through\r\ninvolvement in and service to the important field of education.",
