 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop on molecular modeling will bring together students and researchers from the United States, the Czech Republic and Poland. The proposed meeting will focus on a rapidly developing interdisciplinary field that brings together important areas such as computational chemistry, materials science, biotechnology, solid state physics, and molecular graphics.  The co-organizers of the workshop are Dr. Jerzy Leszczynski from Jackson State University, Jaroslaw Burda from Charles University in the Czech Republic and Waclaw Sokalski from Wroclaw University of Technology in Poland.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of the meeting is to establish an interdisciplinary forum where leading experts representing recently emerging methodologies will meet with scientists interested in their applications in biological and material sciences.  Minority students and post-docs from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) will be invited to makes presentations at this workshop. \r\n\r\nThis is a timely meeting on a rapidly progressing field of research in computational chemistry that also contains an aspect of student training, as this is not an area traditionally taught in the graduate school curriculum.   This project also fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Central/Eastern Europe to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
