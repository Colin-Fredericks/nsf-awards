 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the response of Earth's magnetosphere to variations in solar wind parameters is one of the most important and fundamental problems in space physics. Within the magnetosphere, the location of the geosynchronous orbit is such that its magnetic field and plasma properties are responsive not only to solar wind-magnetosphere interactions at the magnetopause, but also to changes in the inner magnetosphere and the nightside plasmasheet. Fluctuations in the geosynchronous field associated with magnetic storms, Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF) magnetic pulsations, and transient events are just three important examples of how the geosynchronous field can act as a monitor of the effect of the solar wind. This project will focus on the variability of the geosynchronous magnetic field in response to the different types of ULF pulsations. The response will be examined as a function of magnetic local time (MLT) for different geomagnetic conditions. For each passband, the dependence of the variations in magnetic field on IMF orientation and solar wind properties such as proton number density, flow speed, dynamic pressure, and dynamic pressure fluctuations will be investigated. The resultant database of this survey and the statistical relationships among the different parameters will provide a better understanding of how the solar wind influences the magnetosphere. \r\n\r\nThe project includes a tight integration of research and undergraduate education. Undergraduates at Loyola Marymount University will be provided the opportunity to participate actively in the research program, thus enriching their educational experience and providing them with greater preparation for their professional careers. The Loyola Marymount student population is very diverse with about 49% being non-white and 58% female. Educational materials based on this research will also be developed for classroom use. The study will be performed with collaborators at large research institutions, resulting in a partnership that will reinforce the excitement of space physics research among the Loyola Marymount student scientists.",
