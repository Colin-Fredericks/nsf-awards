 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation will support the inaugural conference of \r\nGenerative Approaches to Language Acquisition - North America (GALANA), to \r\nbe convened at the University of Hawai`i at Manoa on 17-20 December \r\n2004. The GALANA meeting is conceived as the North-American sister to the \r\nEurope-based conference, Generative Approaches to Language Acquisition \r\n(GALA), which has been held biennially since its inception in 1993. GALANA \r\nand GALA, both roving conferences, will henceforth alternate from year to year.\r\n\r\nGALANA will complement other existing broad-based and specialized language \r\nacquisition conferences, and it will provide an outlet for the growing body \r\nof generative acquisition research. A major aim of GALANA is to bring \r\ntogether generative researchers in all subfields of language acquisition, \r\nincluding first language acquisition, second language acquisition, \r\nbilingual language acquisition, creole and pidgin studies, and disordered \r\nlanguage development. Notable features of the conference designed to \r\nentice and excite wide participation include: (i) invited presentations by \r\ndistinguished scholars from both the U.S. and abroad, more specifically, \r\ntwo plenary addresses and one half-day tutorial; (ii) two special thematic \r\nsessions, one on the acquisition of Mood/Aspect and the other on child \r\nsecond language acquisition; (iii) three poster sessions, one of them\r\nreserved for graduate students.\r\n\r\nGALANA's broader impact occurs at several levels: First, we are initiating \r\na conference that will benefit researchers for many years to come. Second, \r\nGALANA will promote the participation of beginning researchers, including \r\nthose from under-represented minorities, by offering merit-based travel \r\nfellowships to approximately 15 graduate students.  In addition, the \r\nconference will have a major impact on the infrastructure of linguistics \r\nscholarship at the University of Hawai`i by fostering cross-over between \r\nthe two co-sponsoring departments (Linguistics; Second Language Studies), \r\nproviding undergraduate and graduate students in both departments with \r\nnumerous intellectual and professional opportunities, and spurring Pacific \r\nIslanders' interest in the study of the acquisition of their own \r\nlanguages.  Finally, as a roving conference, GALANA will encourage \r\ncollaboration among centers of generative studies in the U.S., thus \r\nstrengthening the infrastructure of generative acquisition research in \r\nlinguistics.\r\n",
