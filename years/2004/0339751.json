 "awd_abstract_narration": "0339751\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses an entirely new approach to identification of pathogens in bio-aerosols based on performing and controlling biochemical reactions and microbiological interactions directly in air. Current methods for testing infectiousness of air, e.g., contaminated by biological warfare agents or other pathogens do not provide direct detection of pathogens in air. Aerosol samples are usually converted into a liquid sample, e.g., using wet cyclones, where analysis based on PCR or immunoassays implies long analysis time. Phase I research will demonstrate feasibility of performing sample preparation and highly specific identification of pathogens directly in air without introducing the sample into liquid.\r\n\r\nThe research will aid in developing diagnostic methods that are based on collecting and/or detecting pathogens in breath exhaled or cough, methods to rapidly determine infectiousness of air in an environment, e.g., contaminated by biological warfare agents and point-of-care diagnosticmethods.. The Phase II research will provide full development of a marketable prototype with a number of potential medical applications as well as applications ranging from forensic analysis and air-quality monitoring in farming and agriculture to detection of biological warfare agents in portable field devices.",
