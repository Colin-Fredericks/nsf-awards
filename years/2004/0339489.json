 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase 1 project seeks to advance a major application domain for a recent patented technology, Explicit-Multi-Threading (XMT), for building and using computers. Numerous algorithm researchers have developed a computational model, the Parallel Random Access Model (PRAM), during the 1980s and 1990s. From that starting point, a highly parallel XMT processor architecture whose performance objective is reducing single task completion time has been conceived and developed. Using fast driving as a metaphor for fast single task computing, and a flat tire for cache miss, XMT seeks not only to build cars that can be driven very fast; the cars will also allow safely changing a flat tire while the fast driving continues.\r\n\r\nThe XMT technology will give programmers the freedom and power to think and code in parallel. The simplicity of the parallel programming model enables high productivity for the application programmer. Orders of magnitude faster general purpose single task completion time for a given amount of hardware are expected.\r\n",
