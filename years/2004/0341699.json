 "awd_abstract_narration": "Faculty at San Francisco State University are developing and evaluating a new proof-of-concept adaptive hypermedia textbook for use in both the promising new inquiry-based general chemistry curriculum at SFSU, and traditional chemistry curricula. This new textbook is a powerful, flexible tool that is capable of variations in sequence, depth of coverage, and relative emphasis on conceptual or quantitative problem solving skills. It promotes reading as an active, self-regulated meaning/construction process, and adjusts to the needs of individuals in an increasingly diverse student population, allowing content, style and sequencing to be customized to each particular student. Designed around MetaLinks principles and features, and constructed using existing textbook content and ancillary materials, the new hyperbook is being pilot-tested for usability, and evaluated by students and faculty at several schools in both traditional and innovative general chemistry curriculum environments. Evaluation of the new hypermedia text is expected to further establish the potential of such adaptive educational materials to: i) increase the efficiency of student learning and provide superior content coverage; ii)  improve student learning outcomes by increasing learning, critical-thinking and problem-solving skills; iii) encourage student motivation and satisfaction; and iv) ultimately increase the number and diversity of students who successfully complete science degrees.",
