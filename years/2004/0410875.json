 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematical Sciences (21)\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: In teaching undergraduate service courses for engineering, physics, biology, chemistry, and economic students, many mathematics departments face similar challenges: too much material, too little time, appropriate use of technology, and retention of skills. Several traditional four-year institutions have developed a mathematics curriculum called Intermath that has been successful in meeting these challenges. Similar concerns expressed by the engineering faculty at the University of Colorado at Denver (CU-Denver) have led the Mathematics Department to begin implementation of Intermath. \r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of Intermath are to (1) develop a spiraling pattern of subject material within the curriculum; (2) infuse the appropriate use of technology into the instruction of the courses; and (3) incorporate real-world application projects developed in conjunction with partner faculty members. In addition to these goals, CU-Denver has added the additional goal of reinforcing basic skills. Students participating in Intermath are more motivated to learn mathematics, have strengthened problem-solving ability, have an increased understanding of essential concepts, and a mastery of basic skills. Secondary outcomes include improved written and oral communication skills, increased familiarity with technology, and a greater appreciation of the role of mathematics in technological fields. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: At the instructor level this project is planting the seeds for a cultural change in teaching undergraduate mathematics at CU Denver, surrounding community colleges, and local high schools offering calculus level mathematic courses. Full implementation of Intermath at CU-Denver is the first at a nontraditional, urban, comprehensive institution. It requires adapting existing Intermath programs to accommodate transfer students, part-time students, and part-time instructors at CU-Denver. The outcomes of this project will impact mathematics programs at high schools and colleges/universities, both in the Denver metropolitan area and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
