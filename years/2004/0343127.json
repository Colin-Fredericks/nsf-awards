 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global Change and Nitrate Assimilation\r\n\r\nCarbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere that are associated with\r\nglobal warming have risen by more than 30 percent during the past two\r\ncenturies and are expected to double during the next. Some scientists\r\nbelieve these rising levels of carbon dioxide will benefit plants because\r\ncarbon dioxide is one of the essential ingredients in photosynthesis, the\r\nprocess by which green plants use sunlight to manufacture the chemical\r\nenergy they need. Indeed, many plants initially respond to a doubling of\r\natmospheric carbon dioxide levels by assimilating 30 percent more carbon\r\ndioxide into carbohydrate. Further study, however, reveals that the\r\naccelerated rate of carbon dioxide assimilation is not sustained: within a\r\nfew days or weeks of exposure to elevated carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide\r\nassimilation drops back to just 12 percent greater than normal, a phenomenon\r\nknown a carbon dioxide acclimation.\r\n\r\nBloom and colleagues discovered that carbon dioxide acclimation derives from\r\nnitrogen deprivation because elevated carbon dioxide inhibits the\r\nassimilation of nitrate into amino acids in leaves and nitrate is a major\r\nform of nitrogen that plants obtain from the soil. Three mechanisms appear\r\nto be responsible.\r\n\r\nFirst, plants place a higher priority on assimilating carbon dioxide than\r\nthey do nitrogen, so when carbon dioxide levels rise, some of the high\r\nenergy compounds needed to assimilate nitrate are already tied up in\r\nassimilating carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nSecond, to make use of nitrate, the plants initially convert nitrate into\r\nnitrite in the cytoplasm and move the nitrite into the chloroplast for\r\nconversion into ammonium and then amino acids. Bloom's research indicated\r\nthat elevated levels of carbon dioxide blocked this vital transfer of\r\nnitrite into the chloroplasts.\r\n\r\nThird, under current levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen, most plants lose\r\nabout one-quarter of the carbohydrate that they could accumulate from a\r\nprocess known as photorespiration. This process was thought to be wasteful,\r\nunavoidable consequence of the method that most plants use to generate\r\ncarbohydrate. Bloom's latest results show that these plants must\r\nphotorespire in order to convert nitrate into amino acids.\r\n\r\nThese studies suggest that plant and tree species in natural ecosystems that\r\ndepend on nitrate conversion into amino acids in their leaves are likely to\r\nbe at a competitive disadvantage to those species that are either able to\r\nconvert nitrate into amino acids in their roots or use ammonium as their\r\npredominant nitrogen source. As a result the distribution of plants in the\r\nwild may change significantly as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels continue\r\nto rise.\r\n\r\nNitrous oxide is another major greenhouse gas that contributes to global\r\nwarming. Bloom and colleagues showed that wheat plants emit a significant\r\namount of nitrous oxide as part of nitrate assimilation. The form of\r\nnitrogen that a plant uses, therefore, may influence its nitrous oxide\r\nemissions.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will determine the interdependence among\r\nphotorespiration, carbon dioxide assimilation, nitrous oxide production, and\r\nnitrate assimilation. It will employ Arabidopsis genotypes with altered\r\ncapacities to assimilate nitrate and a series of Flaveria species that vary\r\nin their extent of photorespiration. Laboratory and field studies will also\r\nexamine the relative importance of ammonium and nitrate as plant nitrogen\r\nsources. Lastly, at a national facility for monitoring the influence of\r\nelevated carbon dioxide on desert flora, experiments will assess in situ the\r\nextent to which carbon dioxide inhibits plant nitrate assimilation.\r\n",
