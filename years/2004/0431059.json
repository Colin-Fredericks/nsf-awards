 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research touches on both theoretical computer science and artifcial intelligence (AI).\r\nIn particular, the techniques of theoretical computer science will be applied to two significant\r\nproblem areas in AI: knowledge representation and machine learning. Certain forms of knowledge\r\nrepresentation are extremely important for AI applications. Some, such as conjunctions of Horn\r\nclauses, have been studied from AI's earliest days; others, such as decomposable negation normal\r\nform (DNNF), are relatively new. This project will study the computational complexity aspects of\r\nthese and other forms of knowledge representation, and formal learnability results for them.\r\nKnowledge representation is interesting because the choice of representation determines the ease\r\nor difficulty of various tasks that an intelligent agent must perform, such as reasoning or planning.\r\nThe representations of interest for this research include various forms of propositional logic, ranging\r\nfrom disjunctive normal form to DNNF, and various more powerful logics, such as modal logics,\r\nsome forms of predicate logic, and probabilistic description logic. This proposal includes a variety\r\nof problems and approaches, unified by recurring themes drawn from combinatorics and logic.\r\nOne main goal of the proposed work is to advance the understanding of several aspects of im-\r\nportant knowledge representation formalisms. This includes answering questions on expressiveness\r\nfor both basic formalisms such as disjunctive normal forms and decision trees, and also for recent\r\nformalisms such as DNNFs. It also includes determining the complexity of handling exceptions in\r\ndifferent formalisms, which is both a practical problem and is also closely related to some questions\r\non the efficient learnability of the representations. The proposed work will include a probabilistic\r\nanalysis of the important reasoning technique of Horn approximations, in order to identify situ-\r\nations when the method can be expected to work efficiently in spite of examples demonstrating\r\nits worst-case behavior, and an analysis of the possibilities for compiling a knowledge bases into a\r\nmore efficient form having short resolution proofs of its consequences.\r\nAnother goal of the project is to obtain a better integration of the learnability aspect of the\r\ndifferent knowledge representation formalisms into the emerging comparative theory of knowledge\r\nrepresentation. This line of research includes making new progress on old, well established problems,\r\nsuch as learning Horn sentences, the further study of recently introduced problems, such as revising\r\nHorn sentences, and the exploration of representations that have not been studied yet from the point\r\nof view of learnability, such as modal logics. Work is also proposed on the exclusion dimension, a\r\npromising recent notion, in both propositional and predicate logic.\r\nIntellectual merit: The proposal addresses several key issues in knowledge representation\r\nand learning: expressiveness, efficient manipulation, efficient reasoning, and efficient learning and\r\nrevision, in propositional, predicate, and modal logic. The proposal builds on the previous re-\r\nsearch results of the proposers, which includes the development of new approaches to logic learning\r\nand theory revision, and their technical expertise in computational learning theory, computational\r\ncomplexity theory, combinatorics and logic, leading up to a comprehensive, in-depth study of core\r\nproblem areas of artificial intelligence, emphasizing the interactions between the different aspects.\r\nThe proposers have initial results in several of the suggested research directions.\r\nBroader impact: The rapid increase in both the amount of, and the inherent complexity\r\nof data greatly increases the importance of expressive knowledge representation formalisms that\r\nare suitable for efficient manipulation, reasoning, automated acquisition and revision. Symbolic\r\nknowledge representation formalisms based on propositional, predicate, modal and other logics\r\nform an indispensable component in a large number of applications. Understanding the complexity\r\nobstacles in these applications, and identifying possible avenues for circumventing them, is a crucial\r\ncomponent of further development.",
