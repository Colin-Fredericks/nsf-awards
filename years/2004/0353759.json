 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU Site at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) offers an unparalleled opportunity to bring together undergraduate students with internationally acclaimed scientists to explore important ecological questions.  Increasing knowledge of the biological and physical processes that sustain life on earth is the overall mission of the SERC, a 1,300 ha facility of the Smithsonian Institution located on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay.  Educating future generations of scientists is one of SERC's primary objectives, and since 1971 our highly successful undergraduate internship program has accomplished this task.  The REU program provides financial support for 10 summer interns and 5 part-time academic year interns.  Interns accepted into the REU program will select a mentor and spend four days in that laboratory, and one day a week during their first three weeks rotating through other terrestrial or aquatic laboratories.  After settling into an independent research project, interns will be immersed continually in scientific culture and a cohesive curriculum.  They will take a series of short courses and will participate in graduate-level discussion groups.  They also will attend SERC's weekly and evening seminar series and take field trips to affiliated research institutions.  At the end of their internship, interested and motivated students will be encouraged to continue their research through the academic year and accompany their SERC mentors to a national scientific meeting to present their research findings.  Details about the program can be found at http://www.serc.si.edu/internship/index.htm.  Interested students should contact our fellowship coordinator, Ms. Kimberly Sproat (443-482-2217 or sproatk@si.edu).",
