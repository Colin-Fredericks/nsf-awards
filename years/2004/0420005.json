Christy Charlton, a senior graduate student of Boris Mizaikoff, the principal investigator on related  NSF award (0216368), will work with the Director of NCSR, Brian MacCraith, on the development of miniaturized mid-infrared sensing platforms using planar waveguide technology and quantum cascade laser light sources.   This project is part of a strategic research alliance in chemical sensors and biosensors between Georgia Tech and NCSR Dublin that involves an exchange of faculty and students.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\n\r\nThe proposed approach combines theoretical design aspects with device fabrication and experimental testing.  The project focuses on a new generation of highly sensitive molecule specific sensing devices providing a generic modular sensing platform for development of a wide variety of infrared sensing devices.  The use of spectroscopic sensor technology is at the forefront of current challenges for chemical, biological and biomimetic sensors.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact \r\n\r\nThe project integrates research and education at the international level and involves a unique interdisciplinary education environment for the U.S. student.  The complexity of the proposed problems demands a crosscutting approach in the fields of chemistry, materials sciences, micro fabrication, physics, theory and spectroscopy.  It takes advantage of multi-user facilities in Ireland and extensive Irish expertise in mid-infrared sensor technology based on optical fibers. \r\n",
