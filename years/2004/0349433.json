 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: John van de Lindt, Michigan Tech \r\n\r\nThis Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) proposal is requesting funding to support the \r\ndevelopment  of  collaborative  linkages  with  the  E-Defense  large  shake  table  facility  being \r\nconstructed in Japan. The SGER grant also will support the development of a full proposal to NSF \r\nthrough the NEESR (Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation / Research Phase) program. \r\nThe dual objectives of this larger proposal will be (1) to partially tie the large shake table facility in \r\nJapan into the NEES grid, and (2) address the seismic performance of woodframe structures in the \r\noverall NEES framework. Wood structures are the most common structures in the United States, \r\ncomprising more than 80% of the building inventory. They further represent the largest segment of \r\nthe  inventory  at  regions  of  the  highest  seismic  risk.  Wood  will  remain  a  widely  used  building \r\nmaterial  for  low-rise  structures,  in  both  dimension  lumber  form  and  new  wood-based materials. \r\nThe  performance  of  woodframe  structures  in  the  Northridge  earthquake  further  underscored  the \r\nneed for improved methods for (a) assessing the vulnerability of the existing building stock, and (b) \r\ndesign of new structures to better withstand earthquakes with acceptably small amounts of damage \r\nto both structural and nonstructural elements.  \r\n \r\nThe  funds requested for this  SGER  grant  will  primarily  be  used to (1) travel  to Japan  to  further \r\ndevelop  collaborative  testing  plans,  (2)  travel  to  2-3  NEES  facility  sites  (and  possibly  the \r\nUniversity of British Columbia, Canada) to identify suitable assembly testing facilities, (3) travel to \r\nWashington, DC to meet with the cognizant NSF personnel. A small amount of support costs also \r\nwill be requested. If possible, and if deemed to be appropriate, the PI.s will schedule their visit to \r\nJapan  to  coincide  with  the  .2003  Pan-Pacific  Symposium  for  Earthquake  Engineering \r\nCollaboration.  being  held by  Japan.s National  Research  Institute  for  Earth  Science and Disaster \r\nPrevention (NIED) Sept. 30 - Oct. 3.  \r\n \r\nIt  is  anticipated  that  2-3  additional  researchers from  the  US  as well  as  collaborating  researchers \r\nfrom New Zealand  (Bruce Deam,  University  of  Canterbury),  Canada  (Frank Lam,  University  of \r\nBritish Columbia), Italy (Ario Ceccotti, University of Florence), will join this project and be part of \r\nthe  larger  proposal  to  NSF.  The  lead  investigators  from  Japan  will  be  Dr.  Chikahiro  Minowa \r\n(NIED) and Professor Isao Sakamoto (University of Tokyo).  Although the project will involve five \r\ncountries the NEESR proposal will be written so that the US-Japan collaboration is self-contained. \r\nIt is anticipated that the collaborating researchers will apply for funding from their countries. Thus, \r\nthe  success  of  the  US-Japanese  collaboration  will  not  be  dependent  on  their  ability  to  secure \r\nfunding to support their activities. The international collaborative effort will be led by the PI.s of \r\nthis proposal (van de Lindt and Rosowsky).  \r\n \r\nThe  intellectual  merit  of  the  proposed  SGER  project  is  in  the  development  of  a  collaborative \r\nresearch  program  between  NEES  and  E-Defense  in  Japan.  The  broad  objective  of  this \r\ncollaboration, which will be fully developed in the anticipated NEESR proposal at the end of this \r\nyear, is the development of system-level performance information necessary to more fully develop \r\nperformance-based  seismic  design  procedures  for  woodframe  structures.  The  proposed  SGER \r\nproject will have a  broader impact  on  both  the  scientific  community  and  society  at  large. The \r\nearthquake engineering community will benefit from having the E-Defense shake table tied into the \r\nNEES  grid.  This  linkage  will  provide  six-DOF  system  level  knowledge  for  researchers,  thus \r\nallowing  critical  understanding  of  the  relationship  between  assembly damage  and  damage  at  the \r\nsystem  level.  The  broader  impact  for  society will  be  the  development  of  more  effective  seismic \r\ndesign codes and a building inventory that is less susceptible to earthquake damage under moderate \r\nevents.\r\n",
