 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award is for the purchase of (1) a multi-degree-of-freedom solid freeform generation system for the manufacture of micro- and nano-scale optical structures and molds and (2) a controlled-cycle compression molding system.  It is a critical component of a rapidly developing collaborative research program in optical materials, devices, and manufacturing processes to micro-mold advanced optoelectronic devices. The equipment will be used for micromilling research for mold fabrication that will allow continuous profile 3-dimensional molds, complimenting 2-dimensional lithographic molds.  Mold fabrication will be integrated with studies of material processing in compression molding of new sol-gel and fluoropolymer optical materials.  Because geometry and material properties depend on the replication process, the scientific research in the design and replication of micro-optical components will dovetail concurrent metrology advances in the research program.\r\n\r\nThis equipment forms the manufacturing keystone of a large interdisciplinary replication program spanning academic and industry institutions in the Carolinas that will lead to a distributed Micro-Optics Replication Foundry.  The Foundry will allow industry to develop and prototype products, working directly with faculty and students involved in pre-development research, and expose students to manufacturing needs and the complete research and development cycle.  The molding infrastructure and capabilities will also be used for advanced laboratory modules, continuing education workshops, and continued replication research.  The program falls at the interface between the Center for Precision Metrology and the new Center for Optoelectronics and Optical Communications, and will fall under the umbrella of the Carolinas MicroOptics Triangle Agreement.  This is a multi-institution agreement that aims to stimulate economic growth through high-impact research, to provide joint access for students and faculty to advanced one-of-a-kind facilities, and to deliver a well-trained workforce in opto-technologies.",
