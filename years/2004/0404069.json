 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to investigate a new approach for fabricating nanoscale electronic circuits. The approach is to selectively deposit, then lithographically pattern, layers of graphitic carbon on substrates of TiC or Pt, then induce the patterned layers to roll up into small-diameter tubes by heating. This approach allows complex and massively integrated circuits, including branching elements, with controlled chirality of the constituent tube-like elements. \r\nThe ability to pattern complex circuits of nanotubes, control chirality by setting the direction of individual components based on orientation, and to form complex circuit topologies would constitute a revolution in electronics, and would therefore have a broad societal impact. Arguably, without a breakthrough of this sort, nanotubes will not be useful for electronics. Our educational objective is to provide an exciting research environment and opportunities for career advancement for young scientists. The cross-disciplinary nature of the research will provide them with exposure to different disciplines, including Physics, Materials Science, Chemistry, and Engineering.  All three participating groups have strong track records of emphasizing undergraduate research. Overall, this project has the potential to yield a breakthrough in the nanofabrication of circuits.  In concert, we will train young scientists in an exciting field that emphasizes collaborative and cross-disciplinary research.\r\n",
