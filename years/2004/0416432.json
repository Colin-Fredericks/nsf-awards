 "awd_abstract_narration": "Elston\r\n\r\n     The principal investigator and his colleagues organize the\r\n2004 Gordon Research Conference on Theoretical Biology and\r\nBiomathematics.  The format of the conference is nine formal\r\nsessions, each beginning with an introduction to the field by the\r\nsession chair followed by two or three invited talks. In addition\r\nto the formal sessions, there are two afternoon poster sessions.\r\nThe session chairs and invited speakers consist of both\r\nestablished leaders and energetic new investigators who are at the\r\nforefront of quantitative biology.  Consistent with tradition, a\r\nwide variety of topics ranging from spatial modeling in ecology to\r\nbiological molecular motors are represented at the conference. \r\nThis breadth of topics, which includes biological phenomena\r\nranging from the molecular level up to the whole organism,\r\nreflects the theme of this year's conference, \"multi-scale\r\nbiology.\"  Invited speakers are selected based on their expertise\r\nand accomplishments, while trying to balance gender and minority\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\n     The primary goal of this conference is to bring together\r\nestablished and young investigators from the field of quantitative\r\nbiology to share new approaches and discuss advances in this\r\nexciting and rapidly growing area.  The relatively small number of\r\nattendees and informal format of the meeting provide an ideal\r\nsetting for germinating new scientific collaborations. This\r\nmultidisciplinary conference is crucial for identifying new\r\nchallenges and directions in the rapidly growing field of\r\ntheoretical biology.  Many graduate students and postdoctoral\r\nfellows are attending this year's meeting.  Therefore, the\r\nconference serves to increase the number of scientists working in\r\nareas of quantitative biology.\r\n",
