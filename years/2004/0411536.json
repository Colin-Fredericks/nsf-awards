The basic idea is to engage promising engineering researchers from both countries, with emphasis on the younger generation in the community, to explore and discuss important areas of research at the cutting edge of technology.  The German counterpart sponsor is the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation (AvH)  \r\n\r\nA bipartite organizing committee has identified the Internet, Bioengineering and the Food Industry, Process Quality Measurement, and Engineering and Art/New Media as the areas of concentration.  In each of these areas both American and German experts will be speakers reporting on the latest developments in these areas   The program consists of four formal sessions and a technical tour over a three-day period.  Each session entails talks by speakers on advances and opportunities in their engineering fields followed by discussion.  To foster cross-fertilization among disciplines, the talks on cutting-edge research and innovation will be aimed at the technically sophisticated but nonspecialists.\r\n\r\nThe event is scheduled to take place at the NAE Headquarters in Washington, DC, April 29-May 1, 2004.\r\n\r\n",
