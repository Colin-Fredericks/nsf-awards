 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe goals of this proposal are to understand the molecular mechanisms of species-specific sperm egg adhesion in sea urchins and the evolution of genes encoding the macromolecules that mediate adhesion during fertilization.  Sperm adhesion is one of many specific cell adhesion and recognition events that occur during development, but the molecular basis for the specific recognition and adhesion remains poorly understood.  After 30 years of intensive investigation, we have finally succeeded in cloning and sequencing the egg surface receptor (Egg Bindin Receptor, EBR1) for sperm adhesion from two species of urchins, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and S. franciscanus (S. p. and S. f.).  EBR1 from S. f. and S. p. encode a novel subclass of ADAMTS proteins that contain a number of different functional modules, including a metalloprotease domain and thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSR) core region, but have entirely different species-specific domains.  ADAMTS molecules are widely expressed and are believed to play important roles in cell and matrix recognition and adhesion events during development.  \r\nDr. Glabe will investigate the molecular basis for the species-specific interaction between the sperm adhesive protein, bindin and EBR1.  He will determine which of the repeat domains (alone or in combination) in the EBR1 protein are important for mediating the species-specificity of the interaction of EBR1with bindin and we will analyze the molecular basis for specific adhesion dissected by mapping key residues that differ between closely related species and testing their contribution to the specificity.  EBR1s contain a reprolysin type zinc metalloprotease domain that contains a complete catalytic active site, thus the hypothesis that this protease domain is catalytically active will be tested.  He will examine several potential functions of protease activity during sperm-egg interaction, including sperm penetration of the vitelline envelope (VE), the elevation of the VE from the egg surface, and the release or destruction of the sperm receptor on the VE.  \r\nBecause of the fact that EBR1 genes from other closely related species of sea urchins have species-specific adhesive function, we will sequence EBR1s from other species in order to determine their sequence divergence, molecular phylogeny, and whether they display evidence of positive Darwinian selection.   Regions of sequence divergence that are important for determining species-specificity will be identified.  Positive selection for sequence divergence is often associated with molecules that play a role in speciation.\r\n \r\nBroader impact: ADAMTS proteins are a family of proteins that play important roles in cell recognition, adhesion and morphogenesis in fertilization and early development.  Further characterization of EBR1s and the sperm protein bindin may provide more general insights into the mechanisms of adhesive specificity and the functions of ADAMTS family proteins.  How new species arise and become reproductively isolated is an important and fascinating problem in evolution.  Understanding the evolution of EBR1 proteins will lead to greater knowledge of the molecular mechanisms associated with reproductive isolation and speciation.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
