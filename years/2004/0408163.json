 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most bone forms in one of two ways: through a cartilage model (endochondral \r\nbone) or directly in the skin (dermal bone).  Turtle shells and crocodile \r\nscutes are formed of dermal bone, and although some aspects of their \r\ndevelopment are well understood, it is not clear how their development is \r\ninitiated.  Some researchers have proposed that these bones come from a tissue \r\ncalled the neural crest; however, this origin has not been demonstrated.  The \r\nneural crest is a tissue formed in the ectoderm of the vertebrate embryo that \r\ncontributes the dermal bones of the skull.  A separate embryonic tissue, the \r\nmesoderm, contributes endochondral bone to the skull and forms the rest of the \r\nskeleton.  This study investigates gene expression as a means to trace the \r\ncontribution of neural crest and mesoderm to turtle shells and crocodile \r\nscutes.  Genes expressed in neural crest or mesoderm in other vertebrate \r\nanimals will be studied as potential markers for these tissues in turtle and \r\nalligator embryos using RNA hybridization techniques.  The importance of this \r\nstudy for systematics lies in its assessment of the evolutionary developmental \r\norigin of dermal bone.  It may also aid in understanding the evolutionary \r\nrelationships of turtles to other reptiles.\r\n\r\nThis study harnesses approaches from evolutionary biology and molecular \r\nbiology to analyze a very old problem in new terms.  Normally, studies using \r\nthese methods are performed on model systems, such as fruit flies, frogs, \r\nchickens, or mice.  By using turtles and alligators, this study expands the \r\nknowledge and technical resources that can be used for the study of \r\nevolutionary history.  The doctoral student is a Hispanic female, her training \r\nis broad, and she disseminates her work through seminars, courses, scientific \r\nmeetings, and the worldwide web.\r\n\r\n",
