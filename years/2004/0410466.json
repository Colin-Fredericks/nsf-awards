 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discipline: Earth System Science (40)\r\n\r\nThis project is developing a project-based laboratory course in Forensic Geology, presented at a level that is accessible to any student, which introduces students to the principles of Earth Science and their application to forensic science, which allows Earth Science and Science Education majors to apply their knowledge in a novel way.  The course makes use of a research-grade X-ray diffractometer (XRD) and other analytical instruments, and emphasizes team learning, with the students working in groups where individuals act as \"team experts\" on some aspect of the course.  A research-grade XRD is necessary to this work because it can perform micro-diffraction and thin film analysis, capabilities that the current generation of compact diffractometers lack.  Students in the Forensic Geology course use the XRD to analyze soils, coals and/or ores to identify source areas; to identify the minerals in cosmetics and paints; to analyze building materials and safe insulation; and to track the origin of contaminants.  The XRD is also being incorporated into existing courses in Mineralogy and Applied Environmental Methods. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project includes introducing students to Earth Science via real world examples, and training them in the principles of forensic geology, raising awareness of this discipline. The broader impact of utilizing the inventive combination of forensics and earth science should enhance science education and the uniqueness of this approach is expected to attract more students to an Earth Science course and increase understanding of geology among undergraduates in several disciplines.\r\n",
