 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to determine if introduced plants have facilitated\r\nhybridization between two native herbivorous insect species. Putative hybrids of two\r\nbutterfly species, the Great Copper and Edith's Copper, occur in two regions of\r\nCalifornia, where introduced plant species (Curly Dock and Sheep Sorrel) are present.\r\nThe hybrid butterflies feed on these introduced plant species, whereas many populations\r\nof the parental species retain their associations with native host plants. This project will\r\ntest the hypothesis that the introduced plant species are facilitating gene flow between\r\ntwo historically separate, genetically distinct insect species. Molecular marker analyses\r\n(DNA sequence and fingerprinting analyses), will allow detection of recent demographic\r\nevents, such as population expansion and gene flow.\r\nMany, if not all, terrestrial ecosystems have been altered by human-caused biotic\r\nintroductions. These introductions have resulted in numerous novel interactions, many of\r\nwhich have yet unknown outcomes. Native herbivorous insects using introduced plants\r\noffer an excellent system to explore the evolutionary and genetic responses of organisms\r\nto novel interactions. To date, there are no documented cases of hybridization between\r\nnative insect species due to introduced plants. Such 'homogenization' of lineages could\r\nhave profound effects on the genetic diversity of native organisms. This project will\r\nallow researchers to anticipate the future of evolution in light of novel interactions.",
