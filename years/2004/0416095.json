 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Roger Leblanc of the University of Miami is supported by the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program to utilize a two-dimensional combinatorial chemistry technique to produce novel bioactive surfaces. The idea is to utilize engineered peptide lipids spread at an air/water interface.  In project one, it is considered that if enough combinations of these species are present, there should on average be aligned peptide sections that mimic active sites of actual enzymes.  The first target is Acetylcholinesterase.  In the second project, the aggregation of beta-amyloid in two dimensions will be explored. New molecules that act as beta-sheet breakers will be sought.  A third project is to study peptide-capped fluorescent quantum dots as possible optical biosensors.  Monolayer techniques, FTIR spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy will be used in the studies.\r\n\r\nThis work lies in the areas of molecular recognition, signaling and biosensors.  Studying amyloid protein aggregation and understanding its precise mechanism  will enable rational design of beta-sheet breakers that are putative drugs for preventing Alzheimer's disease.  Many of the applications of nanoparticles have been held back due to stability issues in aqueous environments, and the approaches here could serve to lengthen lifetimes and ruggedness of designed particles.   In addition, underrepresented minority students are included within summer experiences at this Hispanic Serving Institute.\r\n",
