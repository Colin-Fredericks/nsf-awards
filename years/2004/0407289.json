 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to Colorado State University-Pueblo (formerly University of Southern Colorado) supports   Dr. Nebojsa Jaksic, for his work under a Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NSE) Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) Award to improve the undergraduate engineering education through a new nanotechnology course, laboratory exercises and the development of affordable nanotechnology instruments.\r\n\r\nTo attract students to engineering, retain them, and provide technologically advanced instruments for undergraduate laboratories and research, nanotechnology will be integrated into three facets of the curriculum. At the freshmen level, students will use an instrument-grade scanning probe microscope available in the Department of Chemistry to investigate the structure of a graphite sheet and \"see\" individual carbon atoms. Through extensive lectures and controlled experiments, diverse student teams will build and utilize inexpensive scanning tunneling microscopes of their own designs. During the course of senior projects and other undergraduate research, students will aim to improve SPM designs under heavy engineering constraints. While the project directly supports diversity (Colorado State University - Pueblo is a Hispanic Serving Institution with approximately 31% minority students), the development of inexpensive nanotechnology research/educational instruments may span an unparalleled amount of educational and research endeavors. \r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education announcement, NSF 03-044, category NUE and was jointly funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) in the Directorate for Engineering and the Division of Materials Research (DMR) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS).\r\n",
