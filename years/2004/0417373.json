 "awd_abstract_narration": "How do legislators' cognitive predispositions affect which organizations they listen to  and which arguments they accept or reject?  The popular portrayal of interest group  influence in Congress is that well-heeled lobbyists pressure those in power to provide the  groups they represent with special benefits such as tax concessions, lucrative government  contracts, or sympathetic regulatory policies.  Yet, many political practitioners and social  scientists alike have long acknowledged that interest groups are an important part of the  political system because they provide valuable information about policy proposals,  constituent preferences, and political consequences to legislators.  \r\nThis study adopts the social cognition approach to decision making to learn how  legislators' impressions about interest group coalitions affect how they evaluate and  interpret information supplied by them.  When receiving policy-relevant information  from lobbyists, lawmakers are hypothesized to be motivated by existing attitudes towards  interest groups and towards policies, meaning that evaluations of both the group's  interests and the group's message affect how influential lobbyists may be.  When  lobbyists attempt to influence members of Congress who are relatively uninformed about  a policy area, legislators will tend to rely on a .group interests. heuristic that cues them  into whether or not the issue being advocated is important.  On the contrary, when  lobbyists target relative experts, legislators will be inclined to scrutinize and interpret the  arguments being made.  The student will recruit congressional staff to participate in an  experimental study that simulates lobbying and agenda-setting under controlled  conditions.  By systematically manipulating the content and source of the lobby messages  in an experimental setting, the student will be able to hypothetically test how legislators.  perceptions of groups. interest bias their judgments about policy arguments, and vice  versa.    \r\nBroader Impacts:  The implications for normative theories of interest representation are that policymakers  are not merely passive lobbying targets who dispassionately deliberate over the pros and  cons of all public policy proposals, but are rather selectively attentive participants whose  perceptions are biased in favor of some interests over that of others.  This study will  therefore improve our understanding of the degree to which traditionally  underrepresented groups are given serious attention in the policy process.   \r\n",
