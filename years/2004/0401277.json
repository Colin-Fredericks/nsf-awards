Of particular interest is\r\nthe question of what behaviours can be attributed to embedded singular\r\nspectrum in the way that solitons are related to isolated eigenvalues. (b)\r\nThe Schrodinger equation with random potentials (or Anderson model) and\r\nits connections to unique continuation and thence to the uncertainty\r\nprinciple (particularly in the form advocated by Fefferman).  This also\r\nmakes links to symplectic geometry. (c) The classical Coulomb gas at all\r\ntemperatures, or equivalently, random matrices at general $\\beta$. This\r\nwill be pursued through the study of orthogonal polynomials with random\r\nrecurrence coefficients as pioneered by Dumitriu and Edelman. (d) The\r\nstability of the absolutely continuous spectrum of general Schrodinger\r\noperators under rough long-range (say square-integrable) perturbation.\r\n\r\nBy studying simple physical models, it is possible to concentrate on\r\nessential difficulties, without being waylaid by technicalities.  The\r\nmethods and perhaps more importantly, perspectives that developed for\r\nthese simple models then inform those working closer to applications.\r\nThree examples taken from this project are the following:  (a) By studying\r\nrandom matrices at general inverse temperature, beta, one hopes to better\r\nunderstand the most interesting case: when beta equals two.  This case is\r\nso interesting because of its (currently mostly empirical) connection to\r\nthe zeros of the Riemann zeta function.  Of course, analytic number theory\r\nhas much to offer society at the present particularly in terms of\r\ncryptography; while this project does not address these questions\r\ndirectly, one must be careful to remember the many tributaries that make a\r\nmighty river.  (b) While integrable Hamiltonian PDEs have received\r\nintensive study in recent decades, attention has mostly been directed to\r\nthe cases of periodic or rapidly-decreasing initial data.  This side-steps\r\nthe very natural question of what behaviours are attributable to the\r\nexistence of embedded singular spectrum for the Lax operator.  As is well\r\nunderstood, solitons are a consequence of isolated eigenvalues.  A\r\npotential implication of this work is the prediction of new quasi-particle\r\nmodes in non-linear media. (c) The better understanding of inverse\r\nscattering found from the study of the one-dimensional Schrodinger\r\nequation with rough and slowly decaying potentials may lead to\r\nimprovements in remote sensing technologies.\r\n\r\n \r\n",
