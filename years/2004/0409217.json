 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative proposal between seismologists and \r\ngeodynamicists to address three major questions.  (1) What is the \r\ntemperature structure of the Pacific lithosphere and upper mantle? \r\n(2) What are the dynamical causes of some of\r\nthe more prominent temperature variations? In particular, are the \r\ndynamics controlled largely by near-surface physical processes (e.g., \r\nthermal boundary layer instabilities or TBI), by processes whose \r\ngenesis lies deeper within the earth (hot-spot plumes, large-scale \r\nupwellings), or by interactions  between deep-seated and shallow \r\nprocesses (e.g., plumes exciting thermal boundary instabilities)? (3) \r\nWhat complementaryinformation is available in radial and azimuthal \r\nanisotropy? These questions are motivated, in part, by a preliminary \r\nmodel  of the thermal structure of the Pacific that reveals that the \r\nPacific lithosphere has experienced a punctuated cooling history, \r\ncooling diffusively for its first 70 Ma and then reheating in the \r\nCentral Pacific between ages of 70 and 100 Ma predominantly at depths \r\nbetween 70 and 150 km. New geodynamical simulations show that TBI \r\nforms naturally as the plate cools and may play an important role in \r\nthe observed cooling history of the Pacific plate.\r\n\r\nThe seismological research will continue to develop data sets and \r\ntheoretical methods to improve the seismic and  temperature\r\nmodels of the oceanic upper mantle. The geodynamic research will aim \r\nto understanding the dynamic interplay between the oceanic \r\nlithosphere and upper mantle. Particular emphasis will be placed on \r\nhow the two-stage cooling inferred for the Pacific lithosphere may \r\noccur, what controls it, and why it may not occur beneath other \r\noceans. Particular interest is in how TBI initiate and evolve, how \r\nplumes erode and reheat the lithosphere and on what controls the \r\nefficiency of this process, and the interrelation between TBI and \r\nthermal plumes.\r\n\r\nA graduate student and undergraduate researchers will work at the \r\ninterface between geodynamical and seismological modeling. In \r\naddition, the research will provide a synoptic view of the oceanic \r\nupper mantle that will be valuable for a number of new and on-going \r\ninitiatives such as Margins, Ridge2000, and Ocean Mantle Dynamics \r\n(OMD).\r\n",
