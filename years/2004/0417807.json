 "awd_abstract_narration": "0417807\r\nALFANO\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to initiate the development of laser Active Cr4+-doped nano-crystallites embedded in porous glass media for wide spectral band laser and optical amplification applications (1100 nm to 1600 nm). These materials combine favorable radiative properties of Cr4+-doped crystals and the advantages of glasses. The proposed research will be focus on materials that overcome these problems and combine favorable radiative properties of Cr4+ doped crystals and the advantages of glasses. Media of such type can be considered an intermediate between single crystals and glasses. The optical properties of doped nanocrystals are expected to be very different than the properties of bulk materials, due to size effects and good isolation of the nanocrystals from the surrounding matrix. The interaction between the doped nanocrystals and the glass matrix will provide information to better understand the nonradiative quenching mechanism in solids.\r\n        \r\nTo study the optical properties and energy transfer mechanisms in the porous glass with embedded nanosize crystals, a set of spectroscopic and time-resolved Raman measurements will be performed. Spatial resolved measurements with SNOM and Scanning Confocal microscopy will reveal optical properties locally at the nanocrystals. The measurements will be carried out on doped nanocrystals of different chemical compositions grown into pores of the glass matrix. Samples will be prepared in house at the City College of New York.\r\n     \r\nThe proposed research may lead to the design of more efficient Photonics materials and has the potential to revolutionize wide band optical communications and optical device technology for optical amplifiers and lasers.\r\n      \r\nThe project will integrate research and educational activities to Extend opportunity for advancing the technology and training of skilled personnel.  Several graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in sol-gel material preparation, spectroscopic measurements and laser technology, several high school students  (grades 11-12) will also become involved in laser development research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
