 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Potomac Communication Group (PCG) proposes to conduct a critical research study about how to best develop a design for creating and drafting a legacy document for the Urban Systemic Program (USP).  Over a two-year period, PCG plans to accomplish this task by building on its existing relationship with and work completed for the National Science Foundation, and in particular, over the last year with the USP.  \r\n\r\nThe prior work with the USP will greatly enhance PCG's ability to complete this task.  Over the past year, PCG assisted the USP districts with \"message development\" as they prepared reports that documented the impact of the USP on science and mathematics teaching and learning in their respective districts.  Therefore, lessons-learned from these efforts will be useful in researching and designing a model approach for composing the legacy document for the USP. \r\n\r\nPCG's goals are to: \r\n\r\n1.\tResearch, write, and produce a printed and electronic legacy document\r\n2.\tUse existing background data to conduct a thorough review of all resources critical to the development of the legacy document\r\n3.\tDevelop a legacy document that will document the attributions of the USP to the implementation of a higher quality science and mathematics program in the funded districts\r\n4.\tCreate an outreach program to share information from the legacy document with the education community. \r\n",
