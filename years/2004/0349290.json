 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMS-0349290\r\nKevin M. Whyte\r\n\r\nThe program of studying discrete groups via the quasi-isometric geometry \r\nof their Cayley graphs was suggested by Gromov in his address at the 1982 \r\nInternational Congress of Mathematicians.  This program has two complementary \r\nparts: finding invariants to show that different groups are not quasi-isometric, \r\nand constructing quasi-isometries to show that similar groups are quasi-isometric.   \r\nThe PI has made several contributions to this program in the past, including a \r\nrecent proof of quasi-isometric rigidity for the group of integral affine \r\ntransformations and the group of automorphisms of a surface group (the latter \r\nin joint work with Lee Mosher).   The PI proposes significant extensions \r\nof these results in the context of the development of the subject of large \r\nscale dynamics. In addition to rigidity phenomena, the proposed research \r\nincludes a detailed study of less rigid groups, which should help to clarify \r\nquestions about quasi-isometric invariance of many algebraic and combinatorial \r\nproperties of groups.     \r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, large scale (or coarse) geometry is the study of geometric \r\nproperties of objects \"seen from far away\". From this perspective, any bounded \r\nobject is indistinguishable from a point, and a line of dots is \r\nindistinguishable from a solid line. This sort of geometry has been \r\ninfluential recently in many areas of mathematics, notably group theory, \r\ntopology, and geometric analysis. This research will explore the large \r\nscale geometry of several classes of mathematical objects, both classical \r\ngeometric spaces and objects only now being viewed in a geometric manner.  \r\nThere has been a tremendous amount of interest in this area of study \r\nrecently, with many of the experts in the field located at one of the \r\nuniversities in the Chicago area.  The proposal includes a variety \r\nof programs to develop interaction between mathematicians, and \r\nespecially their graduate students, within this community.",
