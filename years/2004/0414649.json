The instrument will be used in on-going materials research activities and educational projects in several departments at the College of Engineering. The instrument will have specifications which will allow:(1) a study structural features from nano to micron scale in conductive and poorly conductive materials over large sample areas, (2) to obtain the chemical composition and elemental distribution in different regions of the sample, (3) remote access and control via the internet, for on-line class demonstrations at the graduate and undergraduate level. The instrument will have tremendous impact in enhancing multidisciplinary research and education at a predominantly minority institution as well as in minority serving industry in the island.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program and the Major Research Instrumentation program will enable the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez to purchase a Field Emission Gun Scanning Electron Microscope (FEG-SEM) and ancillary equipment.
