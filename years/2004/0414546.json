 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical signal molecules are important for coordinating reproduction and are often used in conjunction with other signals. In Loligo squid, which swim in schools, the sight of the white egg finger masses, laid in the open (the visual signal), attracts males to the spawning site, and chemical signals from eggs trigger a behavioral change from schooling to male-male competition. In Sepia cuttlefish (typically solitary), visual and chemical cues may be used the other way around. Chemical cues from hidden eggs may attract males to the laying grounds, while the sight of other males is known to trigger male-male competition. A laboratory y-maze will be used to test\r\nwhether chemical cues from eggs actually attract male Sepia. The chemicals that are active in coordinating reproduction in both Loligo and Sepia are found in the eggs, and probably originate in either the ovary or the oviducal gland. These chemicals will be isolated and their molecular properties characterized. The behavioral responses of aggression (Loligo) and arousal or attraction (Sepia) will be used to confirm that the isolated chemicals are bioactive.\r\n      Results will be of interest to investigators studying chemical\r\ncommunication and reproduction, and will result in the training of 6-12\r\nundergraduate students. \r\n\r\n",
