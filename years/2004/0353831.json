 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a joint research and education program between the Materials Research Institute at Northwestern University (NU) and the National Microelectronic Research Center (NMRC) at the University College, Cork, Republic of Ireland.  The project addresses design, synthesis, characterization, fundamental understanding, and optimization of molecule-based nanostructured optical materials for the fabrication of photonic devices with a special emphasis on ultra-high speed optical switches. The approach is to study how new ? (2) and ? (3) materials with (or without) plasmon field enhancement can increase the speed and efficiency of photonic switches. Special focus is placed on the synthesis and self-assembly of unusual new ? (3) materials based on fullerenes, metal oxides, novel metallomacrocyles, and nanoparticle resonant field-enhanced p-conjugated polymers having large third- order optical responses. Another focus is on the study of enhanced susceptibilities in excited molecular states for switching. The fundamental scientific aim of this effort involves the preparation, measurement and understanding of nonlinear responses in metastable excited triplet states. The anticipated application is in optical computing and signal processing, based on an enhanced nonlinear response predicted in such metastables. New molecular chromophores, including those with twisted p -systems, will be designed and synthesized. The long-term objectives of the joint program include the development of ultra-compact photonic and plasmonic integrated circuits including ultra-fast (near-sub-picosecond) optical switches using nonlinear effects in nanostructured materials. The project also will advance theoretical understanding of photonic effects in molecular materials. Involvement in the program will enrich the research and education environment of students, teachers, and their colleagues. \r\n%%% \r\nThe project addresses fundamental research issues associated with electronic and photonic materials having technological relevance. An important feature of the project is the strong emphasis on education, with emphasis on integration of research and education, and an international collaboration providing both scientific and educational benefits. These include: 1. Interdisciplinary and International research opportunities. 2. The experience of integrating research with education. 3. Science content and curriculum development. 4. Outreach and global dissemination of research and education information. 5. Summer Research Program for science teachers and under-represented students-collaborators will host science teachers and under-represented students in their laboratories to perform summer research. Under the proposed program, these summer participants will also be involved in educational exchange programs between Northwestern University and the NMRC in Ireland. This NSF project is a Cooperative Activity in Materials Research between the NSF and Europe (NSF 02-135). The project is being carried out in collaboration with the University College, Cork, Republic of Ireland.\r\n",
