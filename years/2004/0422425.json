 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Scholarships for Computer Science and Engineering Education in Idaho program provides 30 scholarships each year to students enrolling in computer science, electrical, civil, materials science, or mechanical engineering at Boise State University. This scholarship program significantly increases the participation of underrepresented groups in the College of Engineering.  It incorporates existing activities on campus that promote active learning for the student.  The increased recruitment efforts raise the visibility and interest in the engineering programs at Boise State, resulting in an overall increase in the number of students pursuing an engineering or computer science degree.\r\nIntellectual Merit Statement: This project enhances the relationship between the existing programs and the College of Engineering, with the goal of significantly increasing the recruitment and retention efforts for all students, with particular emphasis placed on students from underrepresented groups. The incorporation of CSEMS students into the Residential College is a creative concept that provides students a unique living environment and learning opportunity.  \r\nBroader Impacts Statement: The scholarship program is designed to significantly increase the participation of underrepresented groups in the College of Engineering.  It incorporates existing activities on campus that promote active learning for the student.  The increased recruitment efforts raises the visibility and interest in the engineering programs at Boise State, resulting in an overall increase in the number of students pursuing an engineering or computer science degree.  Boise State is uniquely positioned to provide additional benefit to students resulting from the CSEMS program, since the College of Engineering is relatively new, is growing rapidly, and has limited scholarship resources.  Moreover, Idaho and its growing high-technology economy more and more depends upon Boise State engineering and computer science graduates, 88% of whom remain in the state in local industry or graduate school.  \r\n",
