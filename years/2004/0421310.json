Bonner, Texas A&M University, Corpus Christi\r\n\r\nThis grant will result in improved in situ flow cytometry instrumentation to enable real-time particle detection (colloidal, super-colloidal and microbial) in coastal margin environments. Coastal margins provide ecological and economic services of vast importance to society at large; advancing methods to ensure their sustainable management must continue to be a research and operational priority.  It is widely recognized that real-time monitoring is needed for adequate detection of contaminants in coastal margin ecosystems.  Furthermore, because of the complexity of interacting physical processes in these ecosystems, static monitoring systems are unable to resolve spatial variability at scales necessary for proper environmental management.  Current flow cytometry technology allows for particle discrimination over time at a fixed location.  It does not, however, support real-time detection over broader spatial scales. This is a critical limitation, and one that has hampered progress in protection of marine ecosystems from both natural and anthropogenic disturbances.  The goal is to modify the commercial FlowCAM cytometer and its procedures to allow continuous marine monitoring over both space and time.  A functional flow cytometer will be developed that can be housed in a tube approximately 9 inches in diameter and 3 feet in length.  The instrument will be fitted for use on a towable platform for shallow marine environments. The modifications proposed here will allow: 1) quantitative aquatic particle differentiation; 2) rapid instrument deployment and enhanced mobility for use in shallow water environments; 3) synergy with related coastal monitoring sensors; 4) integration with existing databases; and 5) internet capabilities with data streams to the World Wide Web.   The potential for broader impacts includes immediate alignment with an existing CRCD project focused on creating a GIS-trained student able to use various data streams for accurate data synthesis modeling with a final capstone course combining both concepts into a real world situation.  Further dissemination will occur through existing channels created by the RESSACA CREST and an existing REU Site.  Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi is located in south Texas where the population demographics are heavily Hispanic, underrepresented groups will be provided opportunity to pursue advanced degrees in science and engineering as part of their research training and experience.  The project will result in improved flow cytometry instrumentation that advances continuous monitoring of coastal margin environments, supporting research, education, and public policy designed to protect coastal margin ecosystems.\r\n",
