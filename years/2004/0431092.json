 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\n\r\nCommunication with multiple antennas is a promising technology for\r\nfuture high-rate wireless communication systems. It is often referred\r\nto as space-time communication because the transmitted signal is\r\nencoded both across the antennas (space) and time. Over the past ten\r\nyears, various space-time coding and decoding schemes have been\r\ndeveloped. They can be roughly divided into two categories:\r\nshort-frame code designs and long-frame code designs. Relatively less\r\nattention has been given to the transceiver design issues in\r\nspace-time communications with medium-length frames, i.e., those\r\ncontaining more than a few but less than, say, a thousand bits. We use\r\nmedium-length frames in practice for several reasons: i) The data may\r\nbe bursty and of medium-length, which is often the case in Internet\r\ntraffic; ii) There may be stringent delay constraints which forbid\r\nlong frame transmissions, such as in real-time computing and control\r\napplications. Such medium-length transmissions are not in the\r\nspace-time block-code (or short-code) paradigm and yet not long enough\r\nto allow powerful error-control codes such as turbo or low-density\r\nparity-check codes to demonstrate their full ``power''.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates several key issues in medium-length\r\nspace-time communications. Firstly, it pursues the problem of\r\ntransmitter code design for delay-constrained space-time\r\ncommunications. Secondly, it investigates the problem of high decoding\r\ncomplexity in space-time systems with a large number of transmit\r\nantennas and/or a large modulation constellation, and develops\r\nlow-complex detectors for such scenarios. Thirdly, it deals with the\r\nproblem of space-time channel estimation at the receiver with or\r\nwithout training symbols. The research in these topics will also\r\nbenefit long-frame space-time communication systems, as well as\r\nimportant applications in multi-user detection and in future sensor\r\nnetworks.\r\n",
