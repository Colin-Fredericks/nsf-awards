Datta, Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York and Drs.  Servet Sumnu and Serpil Sahin, Food Engineering Department, Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey.  The PIs seek to validate a previously developed transport model for describing the complex process of baking of dough.  The PIs have separately conducted engineering research on modeling and experimental aspects of baking.  In this project they plan to combine their expertise to further enhance understanding of the heat and mass transport in the baking process.  The research addresses a complex operation in which simultaneous heat, moisture and momentum transfer occur.  The PIs will be attempting to optimize the transfer process, including consideration of properties of biomaterials. The project addresses an economically important and scientifically challenging process, attempting to improve the state of fundamental understanding of the physics, and the knowledge of properties of biomaterials in these cases.  The research will lead to enhancement in fundamental and applied knowledge in transport processes in foods with potential applications in similar processes in related fields. \r\n\r\nScope and broader impacts: This project is likely to have significant impact.  The explanation of the relation between dielectric properties, moisture and microstructure could help pave the way for the development of sensors for porosity and microstructure, which can be extended to other complex biological systems, especially to porous media (not restricted to food).  The project will enhance the international collaboration between researchers at a US and a Turkish university.  Results of this collaboration will have broader benefit to students in both countries as researchers aim to incorporate the study in courses being taught at the two universities and a web-based modeling course.\r\n",
