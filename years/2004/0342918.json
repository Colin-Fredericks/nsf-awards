 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our planet is currently experiencing an alarming rate of species disappearance, commonly referred to as the 'Biodiversity Crisis.'  Among the problems observed by scientists is the declining of frog populations around the world, and hence the increased possibility of species extinction.  Consequently, one of the clear tasks that biologists are faced with is answering:  why is this happening?  In order to answer this question properly, we must first know how many species currently exist.  Furthermore, we must assess the evolutionary relationships among them if we are to understand the historical components that resulted in their origin and current distributions.\r\n \tThe goal of the present proposal is to decipher genetic diversity and evolutionary relationships in a large group of South and Central American frogs, the genus Leptodactylus.  These frogs exhibit an array of different reproductive strategies that undoubtedly have contributed to their success and survival over the last several million years.  Understanding the genetic diversity among the species of Leptodactylus is a prerequisite to understanding their evolutionary relationships and identifying conservation priorities, both in terms of groups and geographic areas that would be critical to protect.  A major result will be a revision and summary of our current knowledge on this frog genus in the form of a final monograph.  These results will also be distributed and available in CD and Web formats.    \r\nThe genetic data will be integrated with previously available and newly gathered morphological data.  Undergraduate science students will have the opportunity to learn molecular techniques, morphological methodologies, statistical models, and web computer designs within a participatory creative process of scientific inquiry.  This scientific training (based on logic and reason) will accompany students in future endeavors, whether those be further studies in basic biology, environmental issues, dentistry, human or veterinary medicine, or indeed, any career path.\r\n",
