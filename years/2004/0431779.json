 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focusing on creating a cohesive General Engineering and Bioprocess Engineering program built on sound learning theory and pedagogical principles. A theme-based spiral curriculum approach, based on pioneering work of Jerome Bruner, is being adopted for the reforms. This Department-Level Reform project is demonstrating an unprecedented level of collaboration between engineering and education faculty members at Virginia Tech.\r\n\r\nThis project is reforming the General Engineering and the Bioprocess Engineering program within the Biological Systems Engineering Department at Virginia Tech. The specific objectives are: 1) Reformulating the existing General Engineering and Bioprocess Engineering curricula using theme-based spiral curriculum design and improved pedagogical methods, 2) Training faculty in the use of learning centered pedagogical techniques, 3) Developing a continual assessment plan to measure the impact of the reformulated curricula, faculty improvement activities, and student learning, and 4) Disseminating the results of the curricular reformulation and pedagogical changes to peers within and outside Virginia Tech.\r\n\r\nThe central idea of the spiral curriculum is that students will pursue their study of diverse engineering topics within the context of one or more organizing themes. Within the Bioprocess curriculum, the theme most relevant and useful is sustainability. By investigating progressively more complex problems situated within this theme, students are able to learn design, systems approach, ethics, and other engineering fundamentals, while emphasizing sustainability. The nature of the spiral concept is that students will constantly be working on the same topic-sustainability-but at progressively higher skill levels, knowledge representation, and commitment. \r\n\r\n",
