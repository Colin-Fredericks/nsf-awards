However, the study of laser hybrid welding is still in its infancy, and even the associated physics are not clearly understood. In fact, a very wide range of physical phenomena occur during the process. Similar to other fusion welding methods, complex melt flows induced by strong vaporization and the thermocapillary effect, heat transport with phase transformations, dynamic free surface evolution, and microstructure evolution form the kernel of the process. However, what makes laser hybrid welding a unique and more challenging process is the complex interaction between laser beams, electric arcs, and plasmas. This extreme process environment caused by their interaction prohibits direct observation and measurement of the welding process. In addition, modeling of this process requires a multidisciplinary and multiphysics approach.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is to develop a laser hybrid welding model especially focusing on the laser-plasma-arc interactions and their effects on microstructure/weld quality predictions. It is also proposed to perform direct visualization experiments using a high-speed CCD camera, called the Reflective Topography. This method will be improved using image processing techniques. Weld microstructure will be investigated using the Scanning Electron Microscopy to verify the model and provide inputs to the model. The Reflective Topography method will be a valuable tool since it enables a direct observation and measurement during the process. \r\n\r\nThis research will be a very extensive and comprehensive work and will help deploy this technology in industry for very challenging joining problems. A better understanding of the process through a systematic numerical and experimental study will aid in manufacturing and will justify more research aimed at developing more efficient and economical hybrid welding systems. This study will be especially beneficial to the shipbuilding industry and automobile industry. \r\n\r\nThe research is being supported jointly by the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program of the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems and the Materials Processing and Manufacturing Program of the Division of Design, Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
