 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research concerns the development of theory, methods and computational \r\ntools for statistical modelling motivated by applications in functional \r\ngenomics. The over-arching theme is that of \"High-Dimensional Model Search,\" \r\ni.e. the development of tools and methods for generating, evaluating and \r\ninterpreting sets of relevant candidate models of a biological problem \r\ninvolving many variables.  Research includes the investigation of models and \r\ncomputational methods for very large-scale graphical models, especially \r\nGaussian graphical models and very sparse model structures, as \r\nrepresentatives of the structure and patterns of association between \r\nbiological variables from observed and experimental data. Contexts of gene \r\nand protein expression studies generate multiple motivating problems and \r\ndata for case studies. In problems of realistic dimension (thousands) any \r\none such graphical model is high-dimensional in both the variable domain \r\n(number of nodes) and numbers of parameters; but, the fundamental challenge \r\nis that the number of candidate models for a given problem is astronomical. \r\nIn fitting and evaluating candidate models, it is typical that many \r\ncandidates have plausible support based on fit to the available \r\nobservational or experimental data and in the context of relevant biological \r\ninformation. Hence the need for methods to identify, explore and evaluate \r\nmany plausible models, and to interpret and characterize their similarities \r\nand differences in both statistical and substantive biological terms. \r\nAdditional classes of regression models, including nonlinear statistical \r\nclassification and prediction tree models, represent flexible frameworks for \r\nthe exploration, combination and utilization of multiple forms of biological \r\ndata in predictive phenotyping for prognosis, diagnosis and discovery. In \r\ngenomic contexts, high-throughput molecular information such as gene \r\nexpression data leads to very, very many potential predictor variables to be \r\nassessed, so that, again, the challenges to statistics include dealing with \r\nand exploring spaces of very high-dimensional models. These central research \r\nchallenges -- variable selection and model uncertainty that, with large \r\nnumbers of variables, are simply unanswerable based on current mathematical \r\nand statistical methods -- form the core focus of this project. Motivated by \r\nand integrated with a number of genomic studies that provide data, \r\ncollaborators and application contexts in functional genomics in several \r\nareas of application, this project involves model development and innovation \r\nin methods of stochastic search over complex and very high-dimensional \r\nstatistical model spaces. This includes associated model theory, methods, \r\nand computational algorithm development that involve distributed cluster-\r\nbased implementations, as well as feedback application in a number of \r\nbiomedical studies. \r\n\r\nModern biomedicine now has access to data of rapidly escalating scales and \r\ncomplexities based on innovations and advances in, in particular, genome \r\ntechnologies. This includes high-throughput genomic data from DNA microarray \r\ngene expression studies in both laboratory and human observational disease \r\nand exposure studies, related large-scale molecular information from \r\nproteomic and metabolic profiling technologies, genetic and sequence \r\ninformation that is quickly expanding towards genome-scale sequence data, \r\nand, of course, traditional forms of clinical, environmental and demographic \r\ndata. Advances in both basic biology and the use of such information to \r\ninform and aid in human health studies requires very substantial \r\nadvances in the capacity to analyse and interpret these data sets of ever-\r\nincreasing scale and complexity. Bringing multiple forms of such data to bear \r\nin defining predictive phenotypes is at the core of the emergent arena of \r\nclinico-genomics, for example. The challenges to modern mathematical and \r\ncomputational modellers are those of very high-dimensional mathematical \r\nmodel specification and analysis, coupled with the need for computational \r\ntools to search across astronomical numbers of candidate models, an endeavor \r\nthat is well beyond the current capacity to implement, evaluate and \r\nunderstand. This challenge defines the core agenda of this research project: \r\nthe development of statistical and computational tools for very high-\r\ndimensional statistical models. The research is coupled with an integrated \r\ncollection of genomic studies that provide data, biological collaborators \r\nand applications in functional genomics in several areas of cancer and \r\ncardiovascular biology, pathway studies in cell cycle regulation and \r\noncogenesis, cancer proteomics, transcription regulation and other areas. At \r\nthe core of the research lies innovation in methods of stochastic search -- \r\ni.e., simulation techniques -- over complex and very high-dimensional \r\nstatistical model spaces, and the associated model theory and methods. The \r\ninherent intellectual merit of the research lies in the advances and \r\ninnovative new methods in computation and statistical modelling, as well as \r\nspecific biological applications. The broader impact of the research lies in \r\nthe applicability of the resulting methods and tools to applications in these \r\nspecific areas, in other related biomedical/genomic applications, and in \r\nother fields of science.\r\n",
