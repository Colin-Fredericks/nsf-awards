 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project creates a Reconfigurable Attack-Defend Instructional Computing Laboratory (RADICL) in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Idaho (UI). The UI is a NSF Scholarship for Service (SFS, aka CyberCorps) school and a NSA Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE).  The UI Department of Computer Science played the lead role in both of those efforts and designations.  However, while the institution and department have adequate facilities for nominal Computer Science and Information Assurance (CS/IA) education, there are almost no instructional computing facilities to enable state-of-the-art pedagogy in attack-defend scenarios. Hands-on experience with these topics requires a laboratory computer network that is both isolated (so it won't impact or contaminate day-to-day computing facilities) and reconfigurable (to allow diverse operating systems, network topologies, and defensive strategies).  There is currently no such facility available to UI faculty specializing in CS/IA education.  This SFS Capacity Building grant creates such a facility, dubbed RADICL, housed within the UI CS Department and supports all existing CS/IA faculty and classes.",
