 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rapid aseismic deformation that often follows earthquakes \r\nprovides a natural opportunity to learn about the mechanical behavior \r\nof the Earth's crust. Geodetic data sets documenting postseismic \r\ndeformation have become much more plentiful and detailed in the last \r\nfew years, yet many studies of these data sets have been limited to \r\ndocumenting that a particular mechanism \"is consistent with\" the \r\nobserved data. The wide variety of candidate mechanisms that have \r\nbeen proposed as the responsible process testifies to the importance \r\nof postseismic deformation in geodynamics, but also to our current \r\nlack of understanding of this phenomenon. The proposed study will \r\ncombine a modeling framework that can simultaneously consider \r\nmultiple rheological behaviors with the geodetic observations through \r\na data assimilation algorithm. This approach, will identify the range \r\nof processes consistent with the data and rule out others, \r\nconstraining the rheology of the crust directly from geodetic data. \r\nModels of shear zone formation and evolution coupled with a \r\nseismogenic fault will be developed to address whether the source of \r\npostseismic deformation is distributed or localized.\r\n\r\nThe proposed study will contribute to basic knowledge of dynamical \r\nprocesses in the Earth's crust and to our ability to evaluate their \r\ncontribution to earthquake hazards. The improved understanding of \r\nshear zone formation will have implications for structural geology \r\nand mechanical engineering, where localization is a permanent \r\nconcern. The data assimilation aspect of this work will help \r\nintroduce a widely successful scientific approach to fault mechanics \r\nproblems. The project represents the merging of the complementary \r\nresearch fields of the investigators, geodynamics for one, and \r\ngeodesy and data assimilation for the other.\r\n-- \r\n",
