 "awd_abstract_narration": "We intend to study maximal models for the powersets of the first\r\ntwo uncountable cardinals as realized by the forcing method in the\r\ncontext of large cardinals and determinacy, and the applications\r\nof these models to other areas, especially topology. Many of these\r\nissues complement a new theory of the infinite developed by W. \r\nHugh Woodin called Omega-logic. By now it is a well established\r\ntheme in set theory that large cardinals impose certain forms of\r\ncanonicity and absoluteness on the universe of sets. In\r\nparticular, the existence of certain large cardinals implies that\r\nthe theories of certain definable inner models of the universe are\r\ninvariant under forcing. Furthermore, these large cardinals also\r\ntend to give rise to a detailed structure theory for these inner\r\nmodels.   The prototypical results of this type are results of\r\nWoodin, building on work of Foreman, Magidor, Shelah, Martin and\r\nSteel, showing that a proper class of Woodin cardinals implies\r\nthat the theory of the least inner model of set theory containing\r\nthe reals and the ordinals (L(R)) cannot be changed by set\r\nforcing, and that this fixed theory includes the Axiom of\r\nDeterminacy. One natural program in the wake of these results is\r\nto identify and study larger models for which similar results\r\nhold. Another direction, noting that the Axiom of Determinacy\r\ncontradicts the Axiom of Choice, is to find similar forms of\r\nabsoluteness compatible with AC. One way of doing this is to\r\nconsider statements to the effect that the universe of sets is\r\nclosed under certain forcing operations. Such statements are\r\ntypically called forcing axioms. Another approach is to consider\r\nforcing extensions of these inner models of determinacy. One major\r\nadvance in this direction is Woodin's forcing Pmax. Heuristically,\r\nevery natural question about the subsets of the first uncountable\r\ncardinal should have an answer in the Pmax extension of L(R).\r\nNonetheless, there are several important questions about the Pmax\r\nextension which remain open. Some of these questions concern the\r\nproperties of the nonstationary ideal on the first uncountable\r\ncardinal. One goal in pursuing these questions is to develop a\r\nfiner analysis of the Pmax extension. In the other direction there\r\nis the issue of whether results obtained by Pmax can be obtained\r\nby other methods. Furthermore, the Pmax method has a number of\r\nvariations, some of which have found application in topology.\r\n\r\nCohen's method of forcing is a way of taking models of the\r\nmathematical universe and producing larger, often very different\r\nmodels. We intend to study properties of the first two uncountable\r\ncardinals as realized by the forcing method in the context of the\r\nregularity imposed by assuming the existence of large infinite\r\nobjects (large cardinals) and certain regularity properties for\r\nset of real numbers (determinacy), and the applications of these\r\nmodels to other areas, especially topology. Many of these issues\r\ncomplement a new theory of the infinite developed by W. Hugh\r\nWoodin. By now it is a well established theme in set theory that\r\nlarge cardinals impose certain forms of canonicity and\r\nabsoluteness on the universe of sets. In particular, the existence\r\nof certain large cardinals implies that the theories of certain\r\ndefinable inner models of the universe are invariant under\r\nforcing. Furthermore, these large cardinals also tend to give rise\r\nto a detailed structure theory for these inner models. One natural\r\nprogram in the wake of these results is to identify and study \r\nlarger models for which similar results hold. One way of doing\r\nthis is to consider statements to the effect that the universe of\r\nsets is closed under certain forcing operations. Another approach\r\nis to consider forcing extensions of canonical inner models of\r\ndeterminacy. One major advance in this direction is Woodin's\r\nforcing Pmax. Heuristically, every natural question about the\r\nsubsets of the first uncountable cardinal should have an answer in\r\nthe Pmax extension. Nonetheless, there are several important\r\nquestions about the Pmax extension which remain open. One goal in\r\npursuing these questions is to develop a finer analysis of the\r\nPmax extension. In the other direction there is the issue of\r\nwhether results obtained by Pmax can be obtained by other methods.\r\nFurthermore, the Pmax method has a number of variations, some of\r\nwhich have found application in other areas of mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
