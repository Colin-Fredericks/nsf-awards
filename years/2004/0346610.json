 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to synthesize ordered nanostructured frameworks containing molecules that undergo large amplitude motions driven by light, to control the motion of the moving end of the molecule, and to design functional materials for applications such as molecular valves and directing the motion of molecules through nanopores.  The research program offers cutting-edge education for both graduate and undergraduate students.  They will learn new concepts about \"nanomachines\" (such as a molecular valve) including how to design and assemble them, provide power to them, and monitor their motion. High school teachers (with additional support from the NSF RET program) will take new concepts to their classrooms. The results of the program will be technologically significant; the availability of light-controlled movement in nanostructured materials will be useful for a number of applications such as controlled drug delivery and sensors.\r\n\t\r\n%%%\r\n\t\r\nThis program involves the design and assembly of functional nanomachines powered by light energy.  The framework of the machine is self-assembled and the moving parts of the machine, molecules that undergo large amplitude motion, are attached to desired locations on the framework. Two important applications are proposed.  The first is a nano-valve, where opening and closing the entrance to a container is accomplished by the movement of the nanomachines attached to the openings.  In the second, individual molecules will be moved through nano tubes by sweeping them with the moving ends of machines attached to the tube walls.  Undergraduate and graduate students and high school teachers will participate in the construction of the machines.  The results will be technologically significant; the availability of light-controlled nanomachines will be useful for applications such as controlled drug delivery and sensors.  The project is a collaborative effort with Prof. De Cola at the University of Amsterdam.  This award is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n",
