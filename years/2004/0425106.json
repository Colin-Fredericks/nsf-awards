Abramson\r\nAffiliation:  Case Western Reserve University\r\nProposal Title: SGER: Thermoelectrics in nature: Electrochemical and thermal measurements of extracellular shark gel\r\n\r\nThe goal of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research (SGER) is to explore a thermoelectric substance found in nature: a gel found below certain species of shark, Cetorhinus maximus, in which a voltage is generated in response to very small temperature gradients. The main objective of the project will be to determine why the shark gel exhibits unique thermoelectric properties. A better understanding of the involved phenomena could potentially lead to the design of better engineered thermoelectric materials for specific applications. Investigations will involve measurement of the thermal and electrical properties of the shark gel and atomic force microscopy imaging of the glycoprotein in the gel to provide information regarding its structure and form. The limited preliminary research conducted on this topic has been performed by researchers with a strong background in biology, but not by researchers with expertise in the areas of thermal/electrical transport or thermoelectrics. This research qualifies as exploratory because it investigates an unusual topic from a unique perspective; it ventures into potentially transformative research; it is likely to catalyze innovative advances; and it has the potential to make a significant impact on the field of thermoelectrics.\r\n\r\nThe proposed activity stands to benefit society through the potential development of novel \"smart\" thermoelectric materials, and therefore energy conversion devices with no moving parts, that are environmentally benign, and that may be easily incorporated into small-scale technologies. If alternative materials tailored with superior thermoelectric properties can be developed, a revolution in energy conversion and generation and heat removal applications will undoubtedly ensue. Beyond the scientific benefit to society, a strong learning and teaching component, integral to the research objectives, will provide for significant educational enhancement for both undergraduate and graduate students involved in the project. These students will greatly benefit from the inherently multidisciplinary nature of the proposed work; mechanical engineers with a background in the thermal sciences will be interacting with faculty and students at CWRU and University of San Francisco who are electrochemists and biologists. \r\n",
