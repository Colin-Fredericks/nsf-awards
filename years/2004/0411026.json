However, current replication mechanisms are en-tangled with policy decisions that make it difficult to re-use existing systems in new envi-ronments and that restrict the effectiveness of systems built using these mechanisms. The goal of this proposed research is to develop a unified data replication architecture and toolkit for large-scale distributed services. If successful, this work will will simplify building systems, improve the availability v. consistency v. performance trade-offs avail-able to system designers, and give the community a deeper understanding of the tech-niques at the core of data replication. Specific research objectives include (1) developing a novel architecture for data replication in large scale distributed systems that separates replication mechanism from policy, (2) systematically developing improved low-level replication mechanisms, scalable and flexible consistency mechanisms, and self-tuning data placement mechanisms, and (3) constructing a toolkit for technology refinement and transfer as well as using this toolkit to develop several key case study replication systems.\r\n\r\nDr. Brett D.
