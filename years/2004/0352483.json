Professors Richard Pratt, University of Pittsburgh and Barum Chatterjee, Bose Institute, Calcutta will investigate one of the basic processes by which photons interact with matter, inelastic photon (Compton) scattering.  This has become a subject of renewed investigation since the precision of experimental measurements has reached a level at which underlying assumptions and approximations inherent in all theoretical calculations can be reexamined.  This research will increase the extent of theoretical understanding of the inelastic scattering of photons, by comparing cross sections predicted from the most advanced theoretical calculations with precise experimental results and with other theoretical predictions.  \r\nThe US PI is the leading international expert in this field of research.  The collaboration, which joins the expertise of an experimental group in India with that of a theoretical US group, will advance fundamental understanding of Compton scattering and motivate new experimental studies at the Bose Institute.  It is expected to enhance research and education in the both countries and encourage the formation of new partnerships.  This activity is cofunded by the Government of India's Department of Science & Technology (DST) under the NSF/DST joint program.   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
