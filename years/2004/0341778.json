Funds are requested to help support travel costs for people participating in the first Gordon Research Conference on Genes and Behavior, to be held on 8-13 February 2004 at the Holiday Inn, Ventura, California.  Gordon Conferences are renowned for catalyzing activity in new fields.  This Conference will focus on selected, important topics at the interface of animal behavior, neurobiology, genetics, molecular biology, and evolutionary biology, to catalyze a broader synthesis of the study of \"genes and behavior.\"  We aim to bring together for the first time those that study behavior in nature in carefully selected \"model behavioral systems\" with those who study behavior in the laboratory with \"model genetic systems.\"  The principal goal is to create an environment, according to the well established and highly respected Gordon Research Conference format, in which experts and trainees in areas of science central to the meeting focus can start to build connections and collaborations to forge a comprehensive approach to the study of genes and behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
