The research problems proposed lead to important\r\napplications in connection with completely\r\nintegrable nonlinear evolution equations and to applications in\r\nsoliton based optical communication systems. The first area is\r\nconcerned with inverse spectral problems with emphasis on\r\ncharacterizing isospectral manifolds for\r\nself-adjoint matrix-valued Schroedinger and Dirac-type operators with\r\nperiodic (and certain classes of quasi-periodic) coefficients.\r\nThe techniques involved comprise matrix-valued Herglotz functions,\r\ninverse spectral theory, uniqueness theorems of Borg and\r\nHochstadt-type, and pencils of matrices and their factorizations. The\r\nsecond area is concerned with spectral theory for a non-self-adjoint\r\nsingular boundary value problem associated with a particular\r\nDirac-type operator. The latter permits the existence of\r\nWeyl-Titchmarsh-type solutions for any point in its resolvent set\r\nunder the most general hypothesis of merely local integrability of\r\nthe potential coefficient.  This property has not previously been\r\nobserved in non-self-adjoint boundary value problems and hence makes\r\nthis Dirac-type operator a model operator of particular interest. The\r\ncommon thread through all the problems proposed is the use of\r\n(matrix-valued) Weyl-Titchmarsh-type functions which encode all\r\nspectral information of the underlying Schroedinger and Dirac-type\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nInverse spectral theory for self-adjoint Schroedinger and Dirac-type\r\nboundary value problems, as proposed in the first part of this\r\nproposal, is one of the pillars of applications of spectral theory to\r\nthe applied sciences including theoretical physics (quantum physics),\r\ngeophysics (seismology), medicine (tomography), etc. As such, it is\r\nan integral part of modern applied mathematics. In addition, this\r\nfirst part permits applications to completely integrable systems,\r\nespecially to soliton equations such as the nonabelian Korteweg-de\r\nVries and the defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger hierarchies of\r\nevolution equations. Completely integrable systems of this type, a\r\nrapidly developing field in pure and applied mathematics especially\r\nsince the second half of the 20th century, have widespread and\r\nmultifaceted applications which include shallow water wave modelling,\r\nvarious aspects of nonlinear optics, and problems in condensed matter\r\nphysics. On the other hand, many concrete applications of completely\r\nintegrable systems naturally lead to non-self-adjoint boundary value\r\nproblems. A prime example would be the area of nonlinear optics as\r\nmodelled by the focusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation. The latter\r\nis intimately connected with a non-self-adjoint Dirac-type operator,\r\nthe principal object of study in the second part of this proposal.\r\nWhile general spectral theory (and especially inverse spectral\r\ntheory) for such non-self-adjoint Dirac operators is still in its\r\ninfancy, we propose a new model for a soliton based optical communication\r\nsystem based upon our proposed study of a special class of soliton\r\npotentials relative to a periodic background potential.\r\n\r\n",
