 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to Johns Hopkins University provides support for the \"Seventh International Conference on Nanostructured Materials (NANO.2004)\" to be held on June 20-24, 2004 in Wiesbaden, Germany. This international conference is a biannual conference in the innovative discipline of nano-technology and nanomaterials.  This conference is expected to feature nano-related sessions on mechanical properties and applications, optical properties, applications, and photonic effects, chemical properties and applications, magnetic, electric and electronic properties and devices, bio-inspired concepts and medical applications, chances and risks of nanomaterials, modeling and computer simulations, and novel processing techniques. With this award, Professor Ma plans to partly support the international travel of US participants, primarily students, postdoctoral candidates, junior faculty members and under-represented groups.  The selection of awardees for travel support will be made by ad hoc committee members consisting of the PI and the past and present chairmen of the International Committee on Nanostructured Materials.\r\nThis conference award is jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Directorate for Engineering.",
