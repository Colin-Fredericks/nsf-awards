 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is developing a multi-purpose smart vibration platform with controllable stiffness and damping ratio for in-classroom demonstration to improve student learning. The platform uses shape memory alloy (SMA) springs, whose stiffness can be adjusted by electrical hearting, and a magneto-rheological (MR) fluids damper whose damping ratio can be controlled by an electromagnet. The smart vibration platform is being used for a variety of demonstrations. The smart vibration experiments are significantly enhancing student learning involving dynamic systems, mechanical and structural vibrations, and vibration controls in multiple departments, including mechanical engineering, civil engineering, and engineering technology. University students, professors, and industrial supporters according to pre-determined evaluation metrics will evaluate the platform and its use as an educational tool. A total of 10 different instructors at four diverse institutions will assist in the assessment and dissemination of the results of the project.\r\n",
