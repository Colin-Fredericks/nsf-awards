We have used\r\nsatellite data and ecosystem models to show that Western US montane regions contribute\r\ndisproportionately to the US carbon sink; we estimated that 25 to 50% of the total continental US\r\ncarbon sink, and up to 75% of Western US carbon sink occurs in mountainous terrain. Our\r\nability to validate these predictions with measurements, or to build on them with improved\r\nmechanistic models, is limited. Although the scaling of biogeochemical processes was\r\npioneered in mountain watersheds, recent research has focused more on the \"tower footprint\"\r\nparadigm than the watershed approach; unfortunately, our current capabilities with tower-based\r\nmeasurements are not adequate to develop accurate mass balance predictions in complex\r\ntopography, and this has diminished efforts to understand biogeochemical fluxes in the\r\nmountains. In this proposal, we develop a \"carbonshed\" approach for the study of the\r\necosystem carbon balance of montane landscapes. We define a carbonshed within the same\r\ncontext as a watershed - a mountainous tract in which the slopes and valleys cause complex\r\ntopographic patterns, which directly influence the drainage and accumulation of CO2, as well as\r\npatterns in the redistribution of energy and water, which indirectly influence the exchange of CO2\r\nacross the landscape. We make the case that the carbonshed scale is crucial for linking local,\r\necosystem-level CO2 fluxes to regional, landscape-level CO2 fluxes.\r\nIn this proposal, we present a plan to measure carbonshed CO2 fluxes in the Front Range of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains in Colorado. Recognizing that direct measurement of carbon budgets\r\nusing atmospheric techniques will be impossible in complex landscapes, we focus on modeldata\r\nintegration, using measurements to calibrate and constrain models, and models to\r\ninterpolate observations. Recognizing also that carbon and water exchange are closely coupled,\r\nespecially in this semi-arid Western environment, we focus on linking carbon and water\r\nmeasurements. We will challenge process models with measurements at multiple time and\r\nspace scales, utilizing seasonal to interannual flux measurements, carbonshed scale campaigns\r\nto scale up (10's of km), and regional (1000's of km) airborne measurements. Large fires in\r\n2002 will allow us to make airborne measurements of carbon dynamics in recently burned\r\nsystems, a unique test of the upscaling of fluxes in disturbance-based models. The project's\r\nmodeling will use a coupled ecosystem-atmosphere model, allowing simulated fluxes to be\r\ntranslated into concentration patterns for comparison to surface and airborne observations.\r\nThe proposal addresses the intellectual merit criteria by 1) identifying a new phenomenon in\r\ncarbon science: the tendency for carbon sinks to develop in high-relief ecosystems, as a result of\r\nthe interaction of climate with land use patterns, 2) proposing innovative and cross-disciplinary\r\nmethods to measure this phenomenon, and 3) assembling a team including biophysicists,\r\nmeteorologists, ecologists and educators to study this problem.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe studies will provide training opportunities for two graduate students and two,\r\npostdoctoral students. The funded activities will serve as the catalyst to develop a new course\r\non human-environment coupling that will include an analysis of the combined roles of land use\r\nhistory, water resources, fire suppression and biophysical controls over carbon in the mountains.\r\nThe research will support a significant K-12 and teacher training program coordinated by the\r\nUniversity of Colorado CIRES Office of Education and Outreach. The proposed research will\r\ncontribute to scientific infrastructure by adding a greatly enhanced carbon cycle instrumental\r\ncapability to the NSF Facilities at NCAR ATD, which are available to the general scientific\r\ncommunity. Additionally, a greatly improved 4-dimensional model for analyzing regional carbon\r\nsink activity will be made available to the general scientific and public policy communities for use\r\nin analyzing US carbon sinks and their relevance to global carbon cycle issues.\r\n\r\n",
