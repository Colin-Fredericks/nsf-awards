 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Gary Holton will conduct \r\nsix weeks of exploratory field work with Nedebang, an endangered \r\nnon-Austronesian language spoken by fewer than one thousand persons on \r\nPantar Island, eastern Indonesia. The project has three primary objectives: (1) to gather basic phonological, lexical, and grammatical information from which to compile a short sketch of Nedebang; (2) to conduct a survey of the grammatical and typological properties of the non-Austronesian languages of Pantar Island; and (3) to assess the feasibility of future longer-term field investigations of the languages of Pantar. Data and recordings gathered during the course of the project will be archived for use by other researchers.\r\n\r\nThe project is significant for three main reasons. (1) The Pantar \r\nlanguages are currently being replaced by languages of wider \r\ncommuication. The timing of this research will ensure that information \r\nregarding Nedebang and other Pantar languages is recorded before the \r\nlanguage ceases to be spoken. (2) The Pantar languages appear to belong \r\nto the Trans-New Guinea language family, a putative grouping of more \r\nthan 500 languages spoken in the New Guinea region. However, their \r\nprecise genetic relationship is unclear. Data from Pantar languages will contribute to a better understanding of both internal and external \r\ngenetic relationships. (3) What data are available suggest that the \r\ngrammatical structures found in the Pantar languages differ \r\nsignificantly from those found in other languages. The results of this \r\nresearch will add to our knowledge of human language and linguistic \r\ntheory by providing detailed documentation of a typologically unusual \r\nlanguage.\r\n",
