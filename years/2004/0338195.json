 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed study will use genetic markers to examine population genetic diversity and structure of the Southern Ocean krill, Euphausia superba (Crustacea, Euphausiacea). This effort builds upon previous work by one of the project participants to develop these genetic markers and the appropriate protocols for E. superba. Molecular genetic analysis is planned for archived samples collected during Southern Ocean cruises to the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) during 2001 and 2002. Temporal and spatial patterns of genetic diversity and structure will be described in the context of krill swarms, bathymetry of the collection region, and mesoscale ocean circulation. Specimens of E. superba will be identified from alcohol-preserved zooplankton samples. Krill from different cruises and diverse regions of the sampled domain will be used to screen 20 to 40 genetic markers to determine levels of genetic differences between krill collected in different regions and at different times of the year in the Southern Ocean. The long-term goal of this effort is to contribute to our understanding of the population dynamic processes determining recruitment and maintenance of Southern Ocean krill. Broader impacts for this effort include training of an undergraduate student; international collaboration in research and education with researchers and students in Europe; and new understanding of the genetic architecture of a pivotal species in a polar ecosystem that is likely to be impacted by global change.",
