 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the \"The Polymer Science of Everyday Things\" symposium and workshop is to explain how things that people encounter and use everyday depend on polymer science for their ubiquity.  Scientists and teachers hear and are excited about inventions continually, but seldom stop to think about common things, such as how musical instruments (e.g.,violins, guitars, and clarinets) are made, and what is important in the construction of CDs, DVDs, and mobile phones.  Seldom, if ever, has there been asymposium and workshop that extends educational outreach on those topics in polymer science to teachers and scientists, by teachers and scientists, with substantial emphasis on three remote-site workshop learning facilities.  Thus, this symposium and workshop fulfill these needs while enhancing education in the field of polymer science and enhancing teaching professionalism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Intellectual Merit: The Workshop and symposium will have scientists of the highest caliber, motication, and communcation skills dedicated to inspiring future generations of scientists and communicating to the public the impact of science \"in everyday things\".  Examples of speakers include Nobel Laureate Alan MacDiarmid, ACS Past President Elsa Reichmanis, and Joseph Nagyvary whose life work has been the study of the relationship of materials science to sound in the Stradivarius violin.
