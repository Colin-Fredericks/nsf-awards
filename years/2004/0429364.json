 "awd_abstract_narration": "To deter any future terrorist attacks, law enforcement and intelligence agencies are making every effort to enhance national security. It becomes the top priority to develop and implement advanced technologies  for information  gathering,  sharing,  and analysis in all levels of  law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Criminal information is the central element in all types of crime data. However, we find ourselves lacking techniques to both identifying a criminal's identity effectively and to recognizing relationships among criminals promptly. The motivation of this research is to address these criminal identity management challenges by developing a comprehensive framework for applying data mining, deception detection, and social network analysis to help identify criminal identities and relationships among criminals. These technologies will be evaluated with real users and law enforcement organizations; related technology adoption and policy issues will also be examined. \r\n \r\nThe primary intellectual merit of this research is four-fold: (a) developing new data mining and knowledge discovery  models  and techniques that  are appropriate for law  enforcement applications but can also be applied in other domains demonstrating similar characteristics, (b) developing a theoretic basis for the formation and the representation of criminal identity deception, (c) developing a framework for automated criminal network  generation  and analysis, and (d) studying the  acceptance and adoption of the  developed  technologies in real-world settings.   \r\n \r\nThe broader impacts of this research include: reducing cognitive and information overload in law enforcement applications; improving intelligence and law enforcement agencies' abilities to detect, prevent, and respond to crimes and terrorism events; and providing techniques that foster information sharing and collaboration among law enforcement and intelligence agencies. Several partnerships with law enforcement agencies will ensure impact.",
