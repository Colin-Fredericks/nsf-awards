This award provides support for a three-year REU Site at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Ten students will be recruited from throughout the U.S. for a ten-week summer experience in research related to contemporary mechanics. Students will have an opportunity to do research in broad areas of contemporary mechanics, from problems related to some of the newest materials such as self-healing polymer composites and nanoscale semiconductors to more common materials such as sand and powders. Research projects will be theoretical, computational, and experimental. The program will provide opportunities for student participants to learn how to give technical presentations and will provide opportunities for discussions on ethical issues related to scientific research and public policy. It is anticipated that this program will have a Broader Impact on the nations need to increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents engaged in research-related careers at U.S. universities, government agencies, and in private-sector organizations.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
