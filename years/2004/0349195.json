 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator develops analytical and numerical\r\nreconstruction techniques to recover quantities important in\r\ntheoretical biophysics.  The systems considered all include\r\nstochastic effects, and the measurements to be considered are\r\ndistributions of first passage times.  Developing physical,\r\nstatistical mechanical models, he uses the first passage time\r\ndistribution function to construct parameters or functions in the\r\nphysical model.  Of particular interest is the reconstruction of\r\nmacromolecular potentials from bond-breaking times.  An analysis\r\nof bounds and how measurement errors affect the stability of\r\nreconstructed quantities is undertaken.\r\n\r\n     The investigator develops mathematical tools, theoretical\r\nand computational, that allow quantitative reconstruction of\r\nunknown quantities from measured data in fluctuating, random\r\nsystems.  This class of problems is called stochastic inverse\r\nproblems.  Two examples are how molecular bonds break, and how\r\nchemical reactions progress.  Typically, for the bond-breaking\r\nproblem, the detailed molecular interactions are assumed known,\r\nfrom which the behavior of the bond (e.g. how likely it is to\r\nbreak) is theoretically predicted.  Similarly, in chemical\r\nreactions, specific reaction rates and chemical networks are\r\nassumed.  One then solves the rate equations with these \"given\"\r\nparameters to find, say, the concentration of a chemical species\r\nas a function of time after the start of a reaction.  In the\r\nformulation of the inverse problem, we do not know the\r\nintermolecular forces, or the rates of chemical reactions.\r\nRather, we measure the lifetime of a bond before it breaks, and\r\nfrom these data, infer the microscopic molecular interactions. \r\nIn chemical reactions, we attempt to use the measured\r\nconcentrations to deduce the chemical reaction rates.  These and\r\nrelated inverse problems have wide applicability in numerous\r\ndisciplines, and can potentially optimize and simplify industrial\r\nprocesses such as drug design and drug delivery.  Moreover, the\r\ntechniques can provide valuable theoretical tools with which to\r\nprobe fundamental genetic regulation processes inside cells.\r\n",
