 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award from the Chemistry Division supports an Undergraduate Research Centers (URC) planning grant.  The PI is John J. Stezowski, assisted by co-PI, T. Adrian George.  The planning activities will develop an Undergraduate Research Center with participants from regional colleges and universities.  Students, along with faculty mentors from their home institutions, will be matched with University of Nebraska -Lincoln (UNL) faculty mentors to undertake research projects of mutual interest.  The URC opportunities will be presented to participating faculty during a 2-day workshop held at UNL.  Projects will be focused on topics relevant to society with emphasis on materials and biochemical systems.  Improving the possibilities for meaningful research for students and faculty at home institutions will be accomplished through the collaborations and by improving their on site facilities with equipment procurement support.  In the planning phase, the PI will develop the interactions with faculty at participating schools, facilitate the development of collaborative projects, and work with the faculty from regional institutions to determine appropriate equipment requests.  The workshop will be a key activity in developing interest and collaborations.\r\n",
