The REU Site is affiliated with the Department of Macromolecular Science and Engineering at CWRU. Ten undergraduate students are recruited nationwide every year for a ten-week summer research experience.  Students are involved in research projects in the areas of polymer chemistry; polymer structure, characterization and testing; polymer processing; and the physics of advanced polymeric materials. Students are introduced to additional topics relevant to their professional development, including laboratory safety, ethics, intellectual property, presentation skills and team working skills. Students also participate in a one-day undergraduate symposium held towards the end of the summer where they present the results of their work.\r\n\r\n",
