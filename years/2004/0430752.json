 "awd_abstract_narration": "This school will be held in Germany and Italy between September 28 and October 4 2004. It will bring five Arizona students majoring in mathematics and science (these are minority students) to work with fifteen German undergraduate students at this International School.  The topics included will be ordinary and partial differential equations, Fourier analysis, mathematical biology and stochastic processes.\r\n\r\nThe US students are identified from Arizona State University having two major 'pipeline' programs for underrepresented minorities: the Mathematics-Science Honors Program and the Mathematical-Theoretical Biology Institute.  These institutes have been active for several years, and train about 175 high school students and about 10 university students each year.  These initiatives have already received national recognition.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that an opportunity for these students to interact with German students would increase the focus in mathematics and science in some underrepresented groups in the US.  This program is being coordinated with an analogous program at the Munich Institute of Technology, which has been running several schools in the past four years.\r\n",
