 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) summer internship program at the Academy of Natural Sciences offers eight students each summer a paid fellowship to conduct independent research for ten weeks with Academy scientists. Research experiences include taxonomic studies using the Academy's biological collections, using both traditional and molecular techniques; field research on the ecology of aquatic systems; and the history of scientific collections. Applicants are recruited nationwide with an emphasis on recruiting minorities and other underserved students. Local recruitment of students, especially minorities, is done via site visits by the REU Coordinator to local colleges and universities, including nearby HBCU's such as Lincoln College and Morgan State University. The REU coordinator also oversees the application process as well as planning and oversight of all activities during the summer.  Students are chosen on the basis of overall interest in organismal biology, evaluations of two referees, and academic performance. After a one-week introductory session, students work on independent research projects with a Ph.D. scientist as his or her mentor. Students work side-by-side with curators and senior scientists and are involved in all aspects of collections-based research including collection and curation of specimens, participation in field expeditions, and dissemination of scientific results through oral presentation and publication. Students also participate in weekly seminars and workshops with scientific staff. At an end-of-summer day symposium, students give oral presentations of their research results. Publication of student papers is especially encouraged and a new aspect of this program is instruction by the REU coordinator on writing a scientific research paper and in-house publication of all student papers. A student database is used to maintain contact with students and monitor their progress after they have completed the program. Each year mentors and students evaluate the program, and assessment by an outside evaluator is conducted bi-yearly to provide guidance for the program.\r\nThis program provides diverse and exciting experiences in collections-based research to train and recruit researchers, teachers, and environmental policy and conservation experts in organismal biology.  In addition, The Academy of Natural Sciences provides an exciting research environment, and its location in downtown Philadelphia offers students a unique cultural experience.  For more information visit our website at www.acnatsci.org/research/reu.html, or contact our REU Coordinator at: reucoordinator@acnatsci.org.\r\n",
