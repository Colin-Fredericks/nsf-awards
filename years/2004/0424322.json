 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to harness mesoscale assemblies of oriented CNTs to create a new class of MEMS devices for actuation and sensing applications, with enhanced sensitivity and versatility.  This will be achieved by combining the unique skill-sets and expertise of the two PIs in oriented CNT growth on Si-based substrates, microanalysis, electrochemical device characterization (Ramanath), and MEMS fabrication, characterization of the dynamics of their motion under electrical stimuli, and tribology (Turner).  In particular, we will fabricate test-device structures such as CNT-integrated SiO2/Si comb-drives and cantilever structures, and measure their mechanical responses to electrochemical and electrical stimuli.  Additionally, adhesive, damping, and tribological properties of the CNT-MEMS components will be evaluated.   \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit and broader impact:  This work will enable the translation of the attractive mechanical properties of individual CNTs into a completely new \"break-through\" technology of CNT-mesostructrure-based microdevices and systems on Si-based MEMS platforms via standard micro and nanofabrication. The success of any of the test-device structures will pave the way for the realization of a new class of devices based on one-dimensional nanostructures integrated with Si technology. This project will provide a unique cross-disciplinary exposure to participating graduate students in the two PIs' research groups at the interface of materials science and applied mechanics, particularly in the areas of nanostructure synthesis, microdevice fabrication, and testing. The newly emerging and exciting area of MEMS integrated wth nanostructures will serve as a well-suited medium in our outreach activities to attract bright high-school students to science and engineering.\r\n",
