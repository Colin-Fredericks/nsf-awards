 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe study of dynamical systems is a modern branch of mathematics which \r\noriginated from physics, mechanics, and differential equations. \r\nHyperbolic and partially hyperbolic systems have been one of the \r\nmain objects of study in the area of smooth dynamics. The exponential \r\ncontraction and expansion in these systems produces a chaotic behavior \r\nwith complex and stable orbit structure. This results in a rich theory \r\nwith applications in various areas of natural sciences and mathematics.\r\nThe PI  considers   Anosov and partially hyperbolic systems whose \r\ncontraction and expansion exhibit some conformality, i.e. distort \r\nshapes only moderately. In higher dimensions, this condition is \r\nessential for the study of regularity of the invariant foliations and \r\nsmoothness of the conjugacy to a small perturbation or to an algebraic \r\nmodel.  It may also yield remarkable rigidity not present in the \r\nlow-dimensional case. The PI plans to  investigate  further  the role \r\nof various types of conformality in the regularity properties. Another \r\ngoal is to study  rigidity under weaker or alternative assumptions such \r\nas smoothness of foliations and preservation of geometric structures.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
