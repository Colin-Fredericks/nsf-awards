The primary purpose of the workshop is to promote community self-organization that we believe is necessary for the first Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction initiative in the Earth sciences.  The content of the workshop will include review the EarthScope science and education program, review the state of knowledge in various fields where Earthscope can be expected to make major contributions, posters by all participants, and breakout sessions to identify major research directions.  The organizing committee will post all participants contributions (papers, abstracts, powerpoint presentations, etc.) on the worldwide web for open access by the global community, and prepare a workshop report.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project is to deepen the understanding of the state of knowledge and the objectives of EarthScope among scientists who are active in the Great Basin, and to expand the constituency of Earthscope in this region to include the resource industries, hydrologic scientists, regional museums, and members of the education community.  \r\n",
