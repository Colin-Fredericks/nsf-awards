Professors K.L. Murty, North Carolina State University (NCSU) and Indradev Samajdar, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB), Mumbai, India will study the anisotropic deformation behavior of titanium and its alloys.  Both the chemistry and the thermo mechanical processing can affect these behaviors and selected grades of titanium alloys will be subjected to biaxial creep testing at NCSU.  Micro textural studies at the IITB along with micro structural aspects will be related to the macroscopic behaviors of these materials.  Working together will enable the researchers to make much better progress in the field of anisotropic deformation behavior of hexagonal close-packed metals and creep anisotropy in titanium alloys.  By having access to each other's facilities, they expect to progress rapidly in fundamental understanding and development of textured Titanium alloys and resolve some of the recent observations about creep anisotropy in application's systems.    \r\n\r\nScope: These investigations are of direct relevance for predicting the dimensional changes in-service of structures made of these lightweight materials that find application in varied technologies used in aerospace, chemistry, energy and defense.  The expertise and facilities at NCSU and IITB complement each other.  US PI Murty has worked extensively in Zirconium and Titanium alloys for more than two decades and has conducted academic research on crystallographic textures, anisotropic deformation and creep.  Indian counterpart Samajdar is highly experienced in texture analysis/prediction and microscopy.  This research lends itself to incorporation in courses offered at undergraduate and graduate levels at both institutions.  Postdocs and research assistants will participate in the research at their respective home and counterpart institutions.   \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
