 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award furnishes travel support for participants in the seventh biennial meeting of the International Quantum Structures Association, held in Denver, Colorado, 17-22 July 2004.  The purpose of the meeting is to present new concepts and original ideas in the field.  Topics of the meeting will include: quantum logics, quantum probability theory, quantum measurements, the philosophy of quantum theory, quantum information, quantum computing and coding, quantales, group theory and quantum mechanics, C* algebras and von Neumann algebras, Hilbert space methods, and applications.  This meeting, the first in this series to be held in the United States, provides an opportunity to increase the awareness and participation of U.S. researchers in on-going international research in quantum structures.\r\n\r\nResearch in quantum structures deals with the mathematics, the physics, the philosophy, the language, and the logic of quantum theory.  Study of these topics is increasingly important in view of recent advances in the application of quantum-mechanical phenomena, including secure quantum communication protocols and the latest efforts in quantum computing and coding.  The biennial meeting of the International Quantum Structures Association in July in Denver provides researchers an opportunity to promote and disseminate information in the field of quantum structures, as well as initiating joint research.  This is especially important to the young researchers from the United States, who will have the opportunity to meet sixty or seventy of the world's leading researchers in quantum structures and begin collaborative research with them.\r\n",
