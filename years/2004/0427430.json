 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThis ITR proposal focuses on developing wireless systems capable of positioning\r\nmobiles remotely in complex mobile environments that are encountered in emerging\r\napplications, such as homeland security, law enforcement, defense command and control,\r\nmulti-robot coordination, and traffic alert such as vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-pedestrian\r\ncollision avoidance. The proposed wireless local positioning system (WLPS)\r\nhas two main components: 1) a base station deployed in a mobile (e.g., vehicles, robots or\r\nhandhelds) that serves as a Dynamic Base Station (DBS); and 2) a transponder (TRX)\r\ninstalled in wireless mobile handhelds, robots and vehicles that act as Active Targets.\r\nSuch a framework offers attractive features including high probability-of-detection\r\nperformance, low-cost transceiver designs and infrastructure-less operation.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed activity is to initiate a multi-disciplinary effort to\r\naddress the key challenges in wireless mobile positioning with seamless network\r\nconnectivity. Based on the DBS-TRX structure, various wireless communications and\r\nnetworking technologies will be exploited to establish a paradigm of contiguous,\r\naccurate and mobility-aware positioning with non line-of-sight coverage. In addition, a\r\nlaboratory will be set up to provide a cost-effective tool to test and evaluate wireless\r\npositioning schemes in simulated practical environments, as well as to assess the impacts\r\nof WLPS on location-critical tasks such as wireless sensor network cooperation and\r\nrouting.\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed activity benefit location-dependent applications that\r\nare critical to human welfare but hindered by the restrictive operation conditions of\r\ncurrent positioning systems. WLPS has multiple potential applications that would benefit\r\nsociety, ranging from improved localization technology for national and homeland\r\nsecurity (NHS) to economic prosperity (ASE) with better highway safety for both drivers\r\nand pedestrians. The laboratory developed will serve as an educational test bed for\r\nengineering students and researchers. With its broad range of applications, its rich\r\ntechnical components and multi-disciplinary nature, the proposed WLPS research will\r\nhelp promote the integration of research with education and outreach activities at all\r\nlevels.",
