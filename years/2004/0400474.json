 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose experimental and theoretical investigations of light generated\r\nelectrons and holes in GaN-based ternary and quaternary materials and\r\ndevices, including compounds with band gap in UV range. \r\n\r\nWe will use Light-Induced Transient Gratings (LITG) system, which exploits\r\nnondestructive techniques including the quasi-steady-state and time-resolved\r\nphotoluminescence spectroscopy in the temperature range from 8 K to 600 K\r\nunder laser excitation at different wavelengths. \r\n\r\n Our studies will include studies of luminescence at different temperatures,\r\nexcitation intensities and wavelengths, time-resolved luminescence,\r\ninvestigations of stimulated emission, and LITG measurements. This will\r\nallow us to determine carrier densities, lifetimes, diffusion coefficients,\r\nand surface recombination rates (mapping large area wafers) throughout the\r\nvisible range into UV.\r\n\r\nComparison of results obtained by the new technique based on LITG with the\r\nresults of the conventional luminescence spectroscopy will provide a new\r\ninsight into the problems, which are of the primary importance for\r\nexploitation of the wide-band-gap nitrides in light emitting and detecting\r\ndevices.\r\n\r\nPhysics of nitride-based wide band gap semiconductors is dramatically\r\ndifferent in many key areas from that of more conventional semiconductors,\r\nsuch as silicon or GaAs. This is linked to a different (and more complex)\r\nsymmetry that allows for spontaneous polarization. Determining basic\r\nsemiconductor parameters for nitrides and relating them to the materials\r\ngrowth and fabrication process, where appropriate, is crucial for developing\r\nnew wide band semiconductor science and for supporting industry with\r\napplications ranging from solid state lighting to ultra high power radars,\r\nfrom water purification to biological hazard detection.\r\n",
