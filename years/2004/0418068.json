 "awd_abstract_narration": "In U.S. elections, voters rely on campaigns to provide information on candidates and their  issue positions. Of the various advertisement strategies available to candidates, television  advertisements are the most frequently used. My research examines whether political elites  employ different campaign strategies for Latino voters and non-Latino voters. As the fastest- growing and largest minority group in the United States, it is important to determine whether  elites are using different strategies towards Latinos, relative to Anglos, and if so, what the  political repercussions are.    I contend that the campaign strategies used by political elites towards Latinos and non- Latinos differ.  The reason for this difference stems from the socioeconomic distinctions between  Anglos and Latinos, where Latinos are more socio-economically disadvantaged than Anglos.  Thus, political elites will design campaign messages that are easily understood and require little  political knowledge, such as focusing on a candidate's ability to speak Spanish or making  cultural references. In contrast, research indicates that English-language advertisements  primarily focus on candidate's policy positions.    Several methodological techniques are used to test the hypothesis. First, I create a formal  theoretical model to explain how candidates advertise to voters. I will then test the predictions  derived from the model. Next, I use statistical analysis to determine whether Spanish-language  advertisements are more likely to include non-policy messages, relative to English-language  advertisements. I continue using empirical methods to determine whether these advertisements  have an impact on Latino voting behavior. \r\n  Intellectual Merit This research project helps to advance the knowledge and  understanding in the field of American campaigns and elections because this comparative  analysis has yet to be analyzed. But since the data that makes this research possible was released  in 2001, this analysis can now be conducted. Given that Latinos by 2050 will comprise 24.5% of  the U.S. population, determining whether there are systematic differences in the way political  elites behave towards them, when compared to non-Latinos, is critical.  The implications from  this research carry serious political and policy consequences for Latinos. ability to become fully  involved in the political system.       We are confident in our ability to carry out this proposed project, since the co-principle  investigator has conducted the same coding process for advertisements used in Spanish-language  races. In addition, the co-principle investigator will monitor the undergraduate students  throughout the entire project and will be available for any questions or problems that may arise.   Also, since the research will be carried out in the Politics department at NYU, access to office  supplies, computers, software, and administrative support will be readily available.   \r\nBroader Impact The research carries several important implications in the realms of  promoting learning and representing ethnic minorities. First, it encourages training and learning  by exposing undergraduates to a variety of valuable research skills. And since this project will be  carried out for a 12 month period of time, students will gain a deep understanding of the research  process.   This research project also enhances the infrastructure for research by making the  completed data available for public use after the completion of the dissertation. It will also have  an impact on underrepresented minority groups since this research focuses on the largest ethnic  minority group in the United States, Latinos.  The findings from this research may help to  identify any discrepancies that exist in elite political behavior towards Latino and non-Latinos,  which may motivate change in elite behavior, and therefore increase the ability of Latinos to  participate in the U.S. political system.     \r\n",
