 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to reconcile two methods for modeling change in\r\nsocial networks over time: a class of statistical models and intelligent agent\r\nmodels. The research contrasts the properties of these two approaches,\r\nexploring what qualitative dynamic behaviors in social networks are captured\r\nusefully and interpretably by each. The primary tools are latent variable\r\nrepresentations and dynamical systems analysis. The result is a framework that\r\ncharacterizes the strengths and limitations of the two classes of models in\r\nmultiple settings, and provides feedback that stimulates refinement of\r\nexisting theories for social networks and development of new theory.\r\n\r\nSocial network theory has produced a wealth of paradigms to describe the\r\nnature and evolution of groups of people who interact, possibly in subgroups,\r\nwith one another. Settings in which social network theory has been applied\r\nrange from friend to corporations to political blocs to religious groups.\r\nCounterterrorism is one application of particular current importance, in which\r\nthe notion that the network might have latent (unobservable) characteristics\r\nthat are important to its evolution over time is especially germane.\r\nCurrently, however, there is not good understanding of strengths and\r\nlimitations of different models for the dynamics of social networks.\r\nThe researchers on this project, drawn from the social sciences,\r\nstatistics and applied mathematics, are constructing a conceptual and\r\noperational framework that allows the principled comparison of different\r\nmodels in multiple contexts. In addition to advances in theory and\r\nmethodology, the framework enables social sciences researchers and other\r\nanalysts to choose a model whose dynamic properties are most appropriate to\r\neach application.\r\n",
