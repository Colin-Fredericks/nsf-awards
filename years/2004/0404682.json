 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal has two parts.  The part on stochastic networks will \r\nconsider networks of queues in heavy traffic when tasks have due dates.  \r\nThe lead times (time until due date) of these tasks are modeled as \r\ncounting measures on the real line.  As part of a previous project, the \r\nlimit of these measure-valued processes was identified as the network \r\ntraffic intensity approached one.  This project will identify the \r\ndifference between the limiting measure-valued process and the pre-limit \r\nprocesses, so that the accuracy of using the limiting process as a model \r\nfor a heavily loaded network can be determined.  The second part of the \r\nproposal treats credit risk in financial markets.  Of particular interest \r\nis the spread movements of tranches of collaterialized loan obligations.  \r\nThese respond to market expectations concerning the default probabilities \r\nof the loans composing the structure, but in a highly nonlinear way.\r\n\r\nComputer networks, manufacturing networks and telephone networks have the \r\ncommon feature that tasks (e.g., messages, silicon wafers, telephone \r\ncalls) arrive at stations (e.g., computers,, machines, switches) at random \r\ntimes and require random amounts of service.  Under heavy traffic \r\nconditions, the performance of these networks can be analyzed using the \r\ntheory of Brownian motion.  In this project, we consider networks in which \r\ntasks arrive and must move through and exit the network ahead \r\nof deadlines.  This project will develop a method to determine what \r\nproportion of tasks a network will process within their deadlines.  \r\nBrownian motion is also the fundamental process for building models of the \r\nbehavior of prices in financial markets.  A second part of this proposal \r\nwill consider prices of financial assets that are backed by loan \r\npayments (e.g., mortgage-backed securities).  These assets are \r\nsensitive to the credit risk of the loans backing them.  Construction of \r\nreliable models for the price movements of these assets is an important \r\nstep in measuring and controlling the risk associated with holding \r\nand trading these securities. \r\n \r\n",
