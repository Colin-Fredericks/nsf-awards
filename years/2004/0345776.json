The building blocks under investigation are fluorobutadienes, fluorocyclohexadienones, fluorovinylsulfoxides and sulfones and fluorovinyl esters.\r\n\r\nWith this RUI award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Timothy B. Patrick in the Department of Chemistry at Southern Illinois University.  Professor Patrick will focus his research efforts on developing methodology for the synthesis of fluorinated building blocks useful for the synthesis of new fluorinated materials.   There is potential for broader impact of the work for the pharmaceutical industry and the project presents an excellent arena for the training of undergraduate and masters students.\r\n",
