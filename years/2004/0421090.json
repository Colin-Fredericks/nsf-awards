 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nTsunamis can be generated directly by seismic impact. However, in some seismic events tsunamis have \r\nbeen  observed  to  be  triggered  by  the  massive  failure  of  the  sea  floor  in  the  form  of  giant  submarine \r\nlandslides. According to the National Geophysical Data Center and World Data Center for Solid Earth \r\nGeophysics  as  well  as  Intergovernmental  Oceanographic  Commission,  in  the  Pacific  Ocean  alone,  65 \r\ntsunami events attributed to submarine landslide caused a total number of 14,661 deaths. \r\n Our ultimate  long-term  goal  is  to  develop  a  fundamental  understanding  of  the  mechanism  of \r\ntsunamigenic landslides and subsequent tsunami generation, propagation, and run-up, which would allow \r\nfor improved assessment and possible mitigation of the landslide and tsunami hazard. Unfortunately, the \r\nfield data from real world observations are limited to very few cases, while the most important part of this \r\ndata  related  to  the  tsunami  generation  stage  is  almost  completely  missing.  The  goal  of  the  proposed \r\nresearch  is  to  compensate  for  this  lack  of  data  by  the  physical  modeling  of  3-dimensional  tsunami \r\nevolution using a novel landslide tsunami generator which will complement the existing NEES tsunami \r\nfacilities. Towards this goal, the following subset of objectives will be achieved in the proposed research: \r\nObjective 1. Model Similitude: The governing model similitude, defining the design parameters for the \r\nproposed landslide tsunami generator, will be determined using dimensional analysis.  \r\nObjective 2. A Novel Landslide Tsunami Generator:  The  proposed  novel  computer  controlled \r\npneumatic  landslide  acceleration  mechanism,  will  enable  individual  control  of  the  dynamic  landslide \r\nparameters such as landslide location, geometry and acceleration. \r\nObjective  3. Landslide Parameters: To design of the experimental program we propose to determine \r\nthe  geometries  and  velocities  of  tsunamigenic  landslides  from  the  case  histories. However,  in  order  to \r\ncover the whole range of possible parameter combinations we are planning to use the novel analytical and \r\nnumerical models of the shear-band propagation mechanisms of tsunamigenic landslides. \r\nObjective 4. Experimental Program: In the proposed experiments we shall measure the characteristics \r\nof the subaqueous landslide motion and the near-field tsunami generation, propagation and run-up in three \r\ndimensions. In addition the resulting landslide deposits will be mapped and their thickness recorded.  \r\nObjective  5.  Validation  of  the  Proposed  Mechanisms:  The  measured  landslide  and  tsunami \r\ncharacteristics  will  be  compared  to  the  existing  real  world  observations  providing  a  validation  for \r\nphysical, analytical and numerical models used in this research. This will justify the use of these models \r\nin the development of fundamental understanding of the coupled landslide and tsunami mechanisms and \r\nallow us to develop recommendations for the future experimental and theoretical research. \r\nExpected  Intellectual  Merit  of  the  Research:  The  proposed  research  will  advance  knowledge  and \r\nunderstanding of landslide generated tsunamis . one of the most devastating natural hazards. Originality \r\nof  the  proposed  work  is  based  on  its  interdisciplinary  nature,  which  combines  experimental  and \r\ntheoretical  Fluid,  Soil  and  Fracture Mechanics  approaches.  The  project  is  a  joint  effort  between  three \r\nGeorgia Tech faculty members who combine expertise in fluid mechanics, physical modeling and tsunami \r\nhazards, soil mechanics and geotechnical engineering, rock and fracture mechanics. \r\nExpected  Broader  Impact  of  the  Research: Understanding of landslide and tsunami mechanisms has \r\nbroad implications not only to engineering but also to human endeavors. It will enhance both assessment \r\nand mitigation of tsunami and landslide hazards. The novel landslide generator developed in this research \r\nwill  complement  existing  NEES  tsunami  facilities  both  in  the  present  and  future  studies.  The  funds \r\nprovided from this proposal will be used to educate and support two graduate students. The results of this \r\nresearch will be incorporated into existing undergraduate and graduate level courses, and a new graduate \r\ncourse on Natural Hazards will be jointly developed by PIs. The results will be disseminated to a broad \r\nscientific  and  engineering  audience  through  publications  in  high-impact  professional  journals  and  via \r\npresentations  at  national  and  international meetings. K12 audience  will  be  reached  by  popular  lectures \r\nand  Internet  postings  emphasizing  the  important  role  of  Civil  Engineering  profession  in  mitigation  of \r\nnatural hazards.",
