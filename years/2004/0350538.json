 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this renewal proposal the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support for the work of Professor Richard G. Weiss of the Department of Chemistry at Georgetown University in Washington, DC.  The research will extend the PI's work on novel materials and their ability to mediate the reactivity of guest molecules.  The materials will consist of self-assembling systems such as ionic liquid crystals, thermally or chemically reversible organogels, and sets of related polymers that can be varied structurally and morphologically.  An important goal of this research is to understand static and dynamic interactions that occur when molecules meet molecules in anisotropic environments. The way in which energy is deposited into materials will also be explored by examining the consequences of UV-Vis and ionizing radiation on the guest molecules and their hosts.\r\n\r\nThe proposed studies are expected to assist the development of green solvents, media for 3-dimensional structure elucidation, and membranes for molecular separations.  An important component of this research will involve the training of young scientists, including those in under-represented groups and from developing countries.\r\n",
