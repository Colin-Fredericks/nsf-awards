 "awd_abstract_narration": "The subject of geometry and deformation theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds \r\nhas seen considerable change and advancement over the last three years. \r\nCentral conjectures have been resolved, presenting a significant need and \r\nopportunity for results to be disseminated and absorbed and for new \r\ndirections to be evaluated. The Department of Mathematics at Wesleyan \r\nUniversity is holding a special semester on the topic of Hyperbolic \r\nManifolds and Geometric Analysis in the Fall of 2004. The department has \r\nalready invited Professor Richard Canary of the University of Michigan as \r\ndistinguished visiting professor for the Fall semester 2004. Wesleyan \r\nfaculty members Petra Bonfert-Taylor and Edward Taylor will also  be \r\nleaders and organizers of this special semester.\r\n\r\nA centerpiece of the special semester will be a three-day conference to be \r\nheld in October 2004.  This conference will gather many of the originators \r\nof the recent exciting advances in hyperbolic 3-manifolds. It is expected \r\nthat  this conference will draw many graduate students and young \r\nmathematicians from the area, as well as established researchers in the \r\nfield. The conference will be preceded by a one-day workshop for graduate \r\nstudents.  The department further plans to invite a series of longer-term \r\nvisitors, to enable more sustained research activity. It is hoped that \r\nhyperbolic geometers  and geometric analysts from the area will also be \r\ninvolved in the special semester on an ongoing basis. For the finale of \r\nthis special semester Wesleyan University will host a public lecture \r\ndesigned to be accessible to the entire Wesleyan community.\r\n",
