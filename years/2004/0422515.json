 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is helping a cohort of CSEMS scholars to progress toward their educational and personal goals by providing (1) increased interdisciplinary student-to-student mentoring, (2) hands-on real world engineering and science project experience through competitions, (3) opportunities for teaming and leadership development, (4) practical experience in fundraising and budgeting and (5) life/career enrichment activities outside the technical area yet essential to success.  The CSEMS scholarships are increasing the involvement of financially needy, academically talented South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&T) students in the nationally recognized Center for Advanced Manufacturing and Production (CAMP).  The project is selecting 30 qualified students to receive tuition and fee assistance in the amount of $3,125 a year. The balance of each year's budget will be used for salaries for eight student mentors and materials and supplies.  Students are selected on the basis of financial need, academic ability and motivation. Assessment of the program is based upon the students' involvement and their persistence and completion rates, and compares both CSEMS and non-CSEMS scholars to evaluate the effectiveness of this effort.\r\n\r\nThe CSEMS project is taking steps to attract more students to experience the opportunities available in CAMP.  The project is specifically targeting recruitment efforts to attract more women and Native American students.  Dissemination of program outcomes is achieved through presentations and papers delivered at forums and meetings such as the American Society for Engineering Education and through the regular SDSM&T communication vehicles -- website, newsletters, brochures, etc.   \r\n",
