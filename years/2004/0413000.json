 "awd_abstract_narration": "Illinois LSAMP Phase III \r\n \r\nThe Illinois Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority  Participation (ILSAMP) traces its origin to the \r\ncollaboration of several institutions in the Chicago area in 1993.  The ILSAMP is a diverse group \r\nof public and private institutions in urban, suburban and rural settings: Chicago State University \r\n(CSU), lead institution, University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Northeastern Illinois University \r\n(NEIU), DePaul University (DU), Illinois State University (ISU), Southern Illinois University at \r\nEdwardsville (SIUE), Southern  Illinois University  at Carbondale (SIUC),  Illinois  Institute of \r\nTechnology (IIT), and  Governors State University (GSU).   Nine  community colleges and \r\nArgonne National  Laboratory,  (ANL)  complete the  Alliance.   These institutions are bound \r\ntogether with a vision of establishing a statewide coalition dedicated to increasing the number of \r\nunderrepresented minority students in science, technology, engineering, mathematics,  and \r\nscience education (STEM). \r\n \r\nDuring Phase I and II the Alliance focused on establishing a management structure and programs \r\nto implement a comprehensive plan to increase the number of underrepresented minority \r\nstudents successfully completing baccalaureate  degrees in STEM by improving the quality of \r\nundergraduate education.  Significant progress was made in the number of B.S. degrees awarded \r\nto underrepresented students by ILSAMP institutions in STEM disciplines.  From 1993 through \r\n2002 the number of STEM degrees conferred upon minority students increased by 85% (228 to \r\n423). \r\n \r\nThe success of Phase  III will be measured by the extent to which ILSAMP can: 1) completely \r\ninstitutionalize  the  activities  that  proved  successful  during  Phase  I  and  Phase  II;  2)  further \r\nincrease the number of underrepresented minority students who graduate from programs in \r\nSTEM disciplines; and, 3) intensify student progression to graduate school through preparation \r\nand the development of pathways to the Ph.D. for STEM baccalaureate recipients. \r\n \r\nIn order to accomplish Phase  III  objectives, the Alliance will utilize strategies to strengthen 1) \r\ncommunity  college  bridge  programs  to  ease  the  transition  for  transfer  students  and  the \r\npreparation of first time freshman; 2) faculty and peer mentoring to help retain students in STEM \r\ndisciplines; 3) supplemental instruction (study groups, tutorials, workshops, study skills training) \r\nto bolster students. academic preparation; 4) academic year and summer undergraduate research \r\nand external internships to develop students for graduate school; and 5) opportunities to develop \r\nstudents.  writing  and  oral  presentations  skills.    Information  concerning  the  program  will  be \r\ndisseminated via publications, presentations and web pages. \r\n                         \r\n      \r\n",
