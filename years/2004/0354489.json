 "awd_abstract_narration": "In one of the most important examples of psychological research applied to public policy, the U. S. Supreme Court in 1954, announced the landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education that made racial segregation illegal in the United States. The Social Psychology Program at the University of Kansas is hosting a conference on May 13-14, 2004 to mark the 50th anniversary of this decision. One goal of the conference is to critically reflect upon past work-such as research about the effects of desegregation on educational outcomes and intergroup conflict-that has applied a psychological perspective to problems of racism and discrimination. Another goal of the conference is to describe and publicize ongoing work-such as research on the psychological effects of affirmative action-that continues to apply a psychological perspective to problems of racism and discrimination. The final goal of the conference is to draw upon research in a variety of social science disciplines to highlight emerging directions-such as Latino or Indigenous Nations perspectives on racism-for future application of a psychological perspective to problems of racism and discrimination. The unifying purpose of the conference is to energize psychologists and researchers in related fields to respond to the pressing need for socially relevant research that serves the needs of local communities while enhancing national unity in the spirit represented by Brown v. Board of Education. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
