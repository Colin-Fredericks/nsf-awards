 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will develop an integrated method to produce semiconductor devices without heat treatment. It targets an urgent industry need for low temperature deposition of commercially important copper indium diselenide (CIS) thin-films for lightweight photovoltaic modules. Present technology uses expensive vapor phase methods that are unsuitable for large-scale manufacturing or for deposition on plastic substrates. This research will develop a new molecular level concept to deposit electronic grade CIS films at room temperature. Phase I research will demonstrate the proof-of-concept for CIS film with a precisely designed electrochemical approach. Characterization of film properties will validate the approach. Phase II will extend the concepts to produce an innovative device configuration with fewer and safer materials than the state-of-the-art. Project success will lead to a totally new photovoltaic device made with cheaper materials and simpler methods. Its scale-up will use inexpensive commercial equipment. Method implementation will raise specific power ratings and lower manufacturing cost. These factors will translate into a wider spectrum of commercial markets for remote, mobile, or grid-tied power generation, building integration, spacecraft and satellite applications.\r\n\r\nThe initial commercial application of this project will be in the production of solar cells. Broader application to other photovoltaic devices is likely. Project success will greatly impact solar cell production, semiconductor synthesis and nanoscale deposition. The low-temperature, low-cost features will introduce an enormous competitive advantage for any material synthesized with the molecular layer deposition method. The versatile method presents an exciting range of possibilities for novel nanostructures and superlattices, with applications ranging from quantum well lasers to solar cells and high strength structural materials. The immediate product will be a solar cell. Lower cost and mass production will allow this cell to compete with electricity prices for terrestrial power. Deposition on polymer substrates will extend its use for space applications. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
