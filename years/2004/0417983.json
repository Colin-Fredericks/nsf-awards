 "awd_abstract_narration": "CMG RESEARCH: Improved Seismic Inference via Better SpectrumEstimation\r\nIntellectual Merits: Much of the inference in seismology, from normal--mode studies to\r\nanalysis of faulting mechanisms, depends on having reliable estimates of spectra and, possibly\r\nmore important, reliable estimates of their uncertainties. The collaborative effort between\r\nmathematics and geophysics in this proposal is being driven by the development and deployment\r\nof high dynamic range broadband sensors networks in the field of seismology that require the\r\ndevelopment and implementation of sophisticated data analysis tools to create a better\r\nunderstanding of the earthquake source and Earth structure.\r\nThe spectra of the transient elastic body waves (P and S waves) provide fundamental\r\ninformation and constraints on earthquake source properties and physics. Currently the state-of-the-\r\nart for the study of the physics of earthquakes is the estimation of source parameters, usually\r\nestimated from the spectra of the transient seismic waves.\r\nSpectral analysis has recently undergone a revolution with the development of\r\nsophisticated techniques in which the data are multiplied in turn by a set of tapers that are\r\ndesigned to maximize resolution and minimize bias. In addition to minimizing the bias while\r\nmaintaining a given resolution, the multi-taper approach allows an estimate of the statistical\r\nsignificance of features in the power spectrum. Developing quadratic inverse theory that utilizes\r\nnot only the spectral estimators, but the time and frequency derivatives of the spectrum, to\r\ngenerate a much higher resolution spectra. This project will extend this theory from a univariate\r\ntheory to generalized multivariate theory. While the applications discussed here are seismic, it is\r\nclear that there are other geophysical, scientific, and engineering applications that will benefit\r\nfrom the proposed studies. Obvious candidates are climate studies (both paleo and modern), and\r\nspace physics.\r\nBroader Impacts: Advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training,\r\nand learning. Broaden participation of underrepresented groups by participation of minority\r\nstudents and by presenting project related web pages in English and Spanish. Broad\r\ndissemination of results will be accomplished through conference presentations, journal articles,\r\nand web presentations.",
