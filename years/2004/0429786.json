 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) promotes new mechanisms and\r\nmethods to improve separation of concerns in software design. AOP is not\r\nwell understood in theory, and remains controversial among researchers and\r\npractitioners. One issue is that it relies on implementation-dependent,\r\nimplicit side effects, contradicting traditional views on abstraction,\r\ninformation hiding, and compositional reasoning. The PIs' goals are to\r\nexplicate fundamental mechanisms of AOP; assess and improve the impact of\r\nAOP on decomposition and coupling; and improve our understanding of the\r\ninherent complexity of, and potential for, compositional reasoning involving\r\nAOP. The approach is to ground AOP in an underlying ontology of implicit\r\ninvocation and then to leverage knowledge in that domain to advance our\r\nunderstanding of AOP. The intellectual significance of the proposed work is\r\nin its potential to improve our understanding of AOP, including effects on\r\nmodularity and abstraction, and the complexity of specification and\r\nverification. Broader impacts are anticipated to flow from regularized and\r\nimproved AOP mechanisms, e.g., for event abstraction. The project will also\r\nsupport development and delivery of a senior-level undergraduate and early\r\ngraduate course on AOP.\r\n",
