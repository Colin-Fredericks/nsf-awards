 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe focus of this research is concerned with developing methods for the use of catalytic metal aryl oxides.  The first goal is to design a Lewis acid assisted catalysis of a number of transformations including ketone aldol syntheses, Michael-Michael annulations, Nazarov cyclizations and Sakuri ene reactions.  Second, the research will focus on the selective and efficient transesterification reactions using tetracyclic bridged phenols, salen ligands and new 8-hydroxyquinoline ligands in concert with Ti, Zr, Hf, Sm, Sc and In metals.  Third, metal aryl oxide cavities based on pyridine base functionalization will be used to promote asymmetric isomerization, racemization, aldol synthesis and Morita-Baylis-Hillman reactions.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Hisashi Yamamoto of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Chicago.   Professor Yamamoto will focus his research efforts on developing efficient catalysis based on the chemistry of metal aryl oxides. The work relies on designing reactions inside the cavity of a metal aryl oxide system, which creates the opportunity for new chemistry to occur.  The project has broader impacts for polymer and medicinal science and will afford an excellent arena for the training of graduate students and postdoctoral associates.  \r\n",
