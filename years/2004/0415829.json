 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Kurt Zilm of Yale University will conduct experiments to develop solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques for structure determination and analysis of large biomolecules in the solid state.  The work is aimed at providing fundamental new insights into the areas of protein-ligand interactions, hydrogen bonding and protein folding, and the role of molecular dynamics in protein folding.\r\n\r\nThese experiments will help to provide a more detailed understanding of the relationship between biomolecule structure and function, which should impact a variety of disciplines: from the design of chemical sensors to the development of environmentally benign chemistries.  The award will provide an opportunity for the graduate students involved to pursue research that is at the interface of Chemistry and Biology.  In addition, the award will help Prof. Zilm to continue his work encouraging students from underrepresented groups to embark on careers in science and will enrich Prof. Zilm's work in professional development activities with local K-12 teachers.\r\n",
