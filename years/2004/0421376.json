 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the acquisition of an advanced analytical transmission electron microscope (TEM) for materials science research and education at The University of Alabama (UA).  This state of the art instrument will be equipped with the ability to do scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging, an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) system, and high angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging.  It will also allow for digital imaging, and high resolution imaging through exit wave reconstruction.  The instrument and accessories have been selected to meet the diverse needs of our multi-disciplinary materials efforts which include: catalysis for fuel cells, magnetic recording, nanoparticles, dielectric layers for semiconductors, metallic/dendrimer interfacial science, and thermal barrier coatings.  The instrument will be housed in a multi-user Central Analytical Facility (CAF), which will make it readily assessible to all researchers in the UA system and neighboring institutions.  This new microscope will allow the research community in the region to more effectively pursue their studies of materials at the nanoscale, while also promoting the teaching, training and learning of the graduate and undergraduate students. It will also aid in the recruitment of underrepresented groups to UA. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis award supports the acquisition of an advanced analytical transmission electron microscope (TEM) for materials science research and education at The University of Alabama (UA).
