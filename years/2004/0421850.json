The WCOAS has become a tradition among the operator algebraists in the western United States and Canada. The expected number of participants is approximately 40-50, including graduate students, postdocs, and faculty researchers coming from all over western North America. The seminar will feature several hour-long talks on current topics given by both established and younger researchers in the region and beyond. The intellectual merits of the West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar are that (1) it is an opportunity for researchers to disseminate their own results; (2) it is an opportunity for researchers learn about recent research of others and to stay abreast of current work; (3) it fosters collaborative research by giving researchers the opportunity to meet and discuss their work with each other.  The broader impacts of WCOAS are that (1) it will encourage and nurture graduate students and postdocs by giving them the opportunity to present their own work, learn about recent work, and meet established researchers in operator algebras; (2) it creates a cohesive regional community of operator algebraists; (3) it fosters connections between the faculty and students at research universities and those at primarily undergraduate institutions.  The proposal is for partial support of the Southeastern-Atlantic Regional Conference on Differential Equations that has met annually since 1981.  The primary objective of the meeting is to bring together graduate students, young investigators, and more senior researchers.  The program features plenary talks by eminent mathematicians, with parallel sessions of contributed papers by younger participants.  The funding will be used primarily for the travel support of graduate students and young PhDs.  \r\n",
