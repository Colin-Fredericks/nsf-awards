 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall objective of this CAREER award is the development of an Internet-scale, on-line predicate-evaluation.  The first specific objective of the project is the validation of a partial synchrony model for the Internet.  The second specific objective is the development of scalable monitoring and predicate-evaluation algorithms which exploit hierarchy by aggregating information, approximating to control of the tradeoff between fidelity and performance, distributing the evaluation of sub-predicates to local domains, within which partial synchrony assumptions will be exploited within. Symbolic model-checking and partial order methods enhance the performance of intra-domain monitoring.  Finally, compositional reasoning techniques and data aggregation will be used to perform inter-domain monitoring.   \r\n\r\nThe expected result of the proposed research is a set of robust and scalable algorithms to evaluate system state with correctness guarantees established with respect to validated synchrony assumptions.  This research is expected to provide a fundamental ability to understand the behavior of a distributed system using techniques that are formally correct and practical, suitable for Grid computing, large-scale collaboration systems, and replicated servers.    The educational objective is to increase in the retention and success of underrepresented students in computer science by explicitly teaching educational success skills through participation in research, through a broad-spectrum introduction to computer science, and through development of academic preparedness specifically relevant to computer science. These activities will take place within the context of the affinity group model.  It is expected that such participation will lead to greater retention and success through the development of affinity and persistence.\r\n",
