More specifically Simon aims to establish  first order\r\nregularity (i.e. that the singular set lies in a locally finite union\r\nof continuously differentiable submanifolds) for various multiplicity\r\n1 classes near points where there is a tangent cylinder with a\r\ncross-section which admits a calibration. Such a result would in\r\nparticular apply to mod-2 minimizers near ``top-dimensional'' singular\r\npoints. Brian White plans to study regularity properties of mean\r\ncurvature flow, including non-uniqueness properties and ``fattening.''\r\nIn addition he will continue his work on the singular structure of\r\nminimizing cones with coefficients in a metric group, and his work on\r\n2 dimensional minimal surfaces with particular emphasis on the study\r\nof branch points. \r\n\r\nAn understanding of singularities, and how singularities are formed,\r\nis a fundamental element in our overall understanding of many physical\r\nand geometric phenomena. For example, in cosmology singularities of\r\nspace-time (e.g. ``black holes'') play a fundamental role, and the\r\nunderstanding of singularity formation in geometric flow problems is a\r\nkey ingredient in the approach of Hamilton, Perelman and others to\r\nThurston's Geometrization Conjecture. Likewise in the study of the\r\n``canonical'' objects which arise naturally in topology and geometry,\r\nsingularities arise in a very natural and unavoidable manner, and the\r\nunderstanding of these singularities is an absolutely fundamental\r\nproblem.  As with most non-linear phenomena, there is not a single\r\ngeneral theory which applies in a wide range of different contexts.\r\nRather, each different context has its own collection of effective\r\ntechniques, and it is the development and application of such\r\ntechniques in the context of the geometric calculus of variations\r\nwhich is the focus of the present research proposal.  Specifically,\r\nSimon and White propose to continue their efforts toward a more\r\ncomplete understanding of singularities, and how they are formed, in\r\nthe context of area minimizing submanifolds and energy minimizing\r\nmaps, and in the context of various geometric flow problems.",
