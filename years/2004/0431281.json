 "awd_abstract_narration": "A fundamental problem in algebraic geometry is the study of the \r\nnature of the moduli space M(g) of curves of genus g as an \r\nalgebraic variety. It is known that for low g this space behaves \r\nvery much like a projective space which means that one can \r\ndescribe explicitly most curves of given genus. However for g \r\nlarge the nature of M(g) changes completely and the investigator \r\nstudies this transition by constructing new loci in the moduli \r\nspace, which are of a completely different nature than those \r\nstudied by previous mathematicians. The geometry of these new \r\nloci strongly suggests  that the transition in the nature of \r\nM(g) appears much earlier than the leading conjecture in the \r\nfield has predicted. The technical machinery developed by the \r\ninvestigator to solve this problem is also employed to study \r\nsome open problems about vector bundles on general curves of \r\ngenus g.  A different project concerns the moduli space of \r\npointed curves of genus 0.  Obects of striking beauty, these \r\nspaces are important because of their pivotal role in new \r\ndevelopments in enumerative geometry and because often \r\nstatements about curves of arbitrary genus can be reduced to \r\nquestions about pointed curves of genus 0. The investigator \r\nstudies several invariants of these spaces and the proposed \r\napproach has been succesful in low dimensional cases. \r\n\r\nAlgebraic curves are ubiquitous objects in mathematics. They \r\nappear in complex analysis (as Riemann surfaces), in algebra \r\n(as field extensions) and in algebraic geometry (as curves in \r\nprojective spaces).  The most important problem in algebraic \r\ngeometry is to classify algebraic varieties. For one-dimensional \r\nvarieties (that is, for algebraic curves) this problem is \r\napproached by considering the moduli space M(g) of all curves of \r\ngiven genus. This is the universal parameter space for curves of \r\nfixed genus and interest in its geometry comes from fields as \r\ndiverse as algebraic geometry, theoretical physics, number theory \r\nor coding theory. By understanding this space not only can we \r\nlearn about families of curves but quite often the moduli space \r\nitself has beautiful geometric and arithmetic properties which \r\none cannot expect to find on an arbitrary space.  \r\n",
