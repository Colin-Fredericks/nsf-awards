 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design and development of future wireless networks and services will require\r\nsophisticated simulation and emulation tools that captures the scale, complexity, and\r\nabstraction of both the protocols that constitute the multi-layered network stack, as well\r\nas the heterogeneous nature of the wireless and wired Internet - tools that currently do\r\nnot exist. Future simulation strategies must capture the heterogeneity of evolving\r\nprotocols while simultaneously supporting high-fidelity wireless modeling environment.\r\nThis proposal will build a comprehensive Integrated Protocol Development Environment\r\n(IPDE) to support design and development of wireless network protocols. This work will enable\r\nresearchers to design and develop end-to-end network applications in a unified public-domain simulation and emulation environment.\r\n\r\nTwo key innovations in this proposal that will empower real time test and emulation of\r\nfuture wireless applications include (i) the notion of relativistic time, that integrates the controllability of virtual-time with the natural selfsynchronizing property of real-time, and (ii) spatial scaling, where\r\nvarious components of the system will operate at different spatial scales - ranging from\r\ncontinuous fluid flow models for the Internet backbone, to discrete packet data flows in\r\nactual routers - with overall spatial coordination occuring in a decentralized manner.\r\nValidation of such an IPDE framework will be in the form of the design and deployment\r\nof multiparametric adaptive algorithms for wireless network scheduling and control.\r\nBy providing an integrated framework for simulation, hardware emulation, and direct\r\ncode execution of network protocols, the IPDE will enable researchers to setup large\r\nscale virtual test-beds, validate their modeling, and design middleware algorithms.",
