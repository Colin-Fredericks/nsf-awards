 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education (NSEE) Center for Learning and Teaching (NCLT) would focus on the research and development of nano-science instructional resources for grades 7-16, related professional development opportunities for 7-12 teachers, and programs infused with nano-science content for education doctoral students.  The Center would bring together educators and scientists from several areas of nano-science and engineering research to collaborate with science teachers and doctoral candidates in education on both the development of the resources and research on their efficacy.  The PI has prior experience as director of the Materials World Modules project, an NSF-funded curriculum currently in use in several secondary schools across the country.  Lead partners in the proposed Center are Northwestern University, Purdue University, University of Michigan, University of Illinois at Chicago and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Additional partners include Argonne National Laboratory, West Point Military Academy, Alabama A & M University, Fisk University, Hampton University, Morehouse College and University of Texas at El Paso.  The additional partners will widen the geographic range of the project, expanding opportunities to reach a diverse and currently underrepresented population of graduate students, teachers and ultimately students.  \r\n\r\nSTEM and Education faculty and researchers from the partner institutions would participate in interdisciplinary teams to address the Center's mission:\r\n\r\nProvide national education leadership and resources for advancing NSEE \r\nCreate and implement professional development programs in NSEE\r\nUse innovative ideas in learning to design instructional materials for grades 7-16\r\n\r\nConduct research relating to integration of NSEE into science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education.\r\n",

Established under the U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative[1], the Center had a mission to \"develop the next generation of leaders in NSE teaching and learning, with an emphasis on NSEE capacity building, and thereby provide a strong impact on our national STEM education.\"  \n\nCenter goals were to:\n\nProvide national education leadership and resources for advancing NSEE;\nConduct research relating to integration of NSE into STEM curricula; \nCreate a new national workforce of STEM leaders who are knowledgeable in NSE;\nProvide current teachers and faculty with professional development in NSE; and\nFoster the development of a national NSEE community.\n\n\n \n\nBackground\n\nWhat is Nanoscale Science and Engineering (NSE)? The nanoscale is the region from 1 to 100 nanometers, which falls between the atomic scale and the micro/macroscale of matter. Nanoscale science is the study of the unique phenomena associated with the unusual physical, chemical, and biological properties of matter in this scale range. There is a fusion of these unique properties and corresponding disciplines at the nanoscale. Nanoscale engineering applies the unique properties of matter at the nanoscale to the design of new materials, devices, and systems.\n\nEconomic Importance of NSE: The last few decades have witnessed exponential growth in innovative technologies based on nanoscale materials and their properties. Nanomaterials-based systems have myriad technological applications, from mobile devices to medical diagnostic instruments and cloud computing. In the next century, nanotechnology will play an increasingly vital role in providing clean energy, healthcare and security for the world\u00c6s citizens, and will drive a large fraction of the world economy.\n\nImportance of NSE Education (NSEE): The U.S. education system must respond to this rapidly changing economic landscape by improving nano-literacy and equipping U.S. citizens with a better understanding and appreciation for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). NSEE is uniquely suited for this purpose because it: (1) transcends traditional disciplinary barriers and fosters a more integrated approach to STEM teaching; (2) allows students to experience the connectivity among STEM disciplines and grasp the broader relevance of STEM to everyday life and the economy; (3) incorporates the engineering and design principles needed to train a high-tech workforce; and (4) get students excited about math and science by transferring the latest cutting-edge research and applications into classrooms.\n\n \n\nOutcomes of the NCLT Center Project\n\nIntellectual Merit: The Center established an integrated program designed to build national capacity in NSEE through learning and teaching research; the development of instructional materials for grades 7-16; the establishment of curricula and degree programs; professional development for teachers and faculty; evaluation and assessment; and networking, community building and outreach. Integrated, multidisciplinary working groups were created in each of these component areas, each involving students and faculty from the eleven partner institutions and members from nanoscience, nanoengineering, and education sciences. The interdisciplinary focus of the Center program was \"Learning and Teaching through Inquiry and Design of Nanoscale Materials and Applications.\" Instructional content developed by the Center emphasized a cross-cutting approach to science and engineering and the methodology of inquiry and design.\n\nBroader Impact: Since its inception, NCLT has significantly improved nano-literacy, NSEE capacity and STEM educatio..."
