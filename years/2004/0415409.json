The ability to determine the patterns of connections\r\namong neurons would facilitate discovering how such computations\r\nare performed.  Because many connectivity patterns could\r\ntheoretically produce neural output with only subtle differences,\r\ncharacterizing even basic circuitry elements within the brain\r\nremains a formidable challenge.  The goal of this project is to\r\ndevelop and analyze mathematical models of neuronal networks in\r\norder to design tools that can distinguish among network\r\nconfigurations.  Preliminary studies have demonstrated a new\r\napproach that shows promise of leading to tools to infer\r\nconnectivity patterns in spiking neuronal networks.  The key idea\r\nmotivating this approach is to exploit models of neural response\r\nto an experimentally controlled stimulus in order to analyze\r\nneuron output.  The explicit structure imposed by mathematical\r\nmodels helps overcome a major difficulty in estimating network\r\nconnectivity from experiments: the fact that only a small subset\r\nof neurons can be measured simultaneously.  Hence, the central\r\nchallenge addressed by this project is accounting for the effects\r\nof unmeasured neurons. Mathematical models lead to predictions of\r\nthe effects of connections from unmeasured neurons.  The aim of\r\nthe work is to use these predictions to factor out the effects of\r\nunmeasured neurons and better estimate the connectivity among the\r\nmeasured neurons.  The resulting tools help neuroscientists\r\nunderstand local circuits that underlie neural processing and\r\nfunction within the brain.\r\n\r\n     The goal of this work is to develop mathematical tools that\r\nneuroscientists can use to determine how neurons in the brain are\r\nconnected to each other.  Understanding how neurons are connected\r\nis an important first step toward discovering how neurons\r\ncommunicate with each other to process information.  Such\r\nknowledge could help scientists better understand the effects of\r\nthe degradation of such connections, such as in neurodegenerative\r\ndiseases, and devise strategies to mitigate or reverse these\r\neffects.\r\n",
