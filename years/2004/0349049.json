 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project seeks to substantially enhance research and education in the areas of solid state physics and nano-electronics at the City College of New York. The objective of the research is to apply highly sensitive microwave techniques to answer questions regarding quantum dynamics of strongly correlated, low dimensional electron systems and nano-structures - this is one of the most important issues in condensed matter physics. Quantum coherence of electron states, effects of electron-electron interactions and spin polarization on the kinetic of the disordered quantum systems are targets; these will provide significant information for future applications employing quantum properties of matter. The educational component of the proposed activity, including domestic and international collaborations, presents an excellent opportunity for the diverse City College students to get valuable knowledge and marketable experience in advanced areas of quantum physics, micro- and nano-electronics.    \r\n\r\nThis Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project seeks to substantially enhance research and education in the areas of solid state physics and nano-electronics at the City College of New York. The objective of the research is to apply highly sensitive microwave techniques to answer questions regarding quantum properties of physical systems with very small sizes on the order of nanometers. These systems, sometimes called nano-systems, are key elements of future electronic devices  employing quantum properties of matter. The proposed research will provide valuable information regarding the response of the nano-systems to a rapidly varying electromagnetic field, a feature that is important for many applications. Situated in the heart of Harlem, the City College of New York is a public institution that serves a very diverse student body, with many students from underrepresented groups.  The educational component of the project, including domestic and international collaborations, provides an excellent opportunity for students to get significant knowledge and marketable experience in advanced areas of quantum physics, micro- and nano-electronics.    \r\n\r\n",
