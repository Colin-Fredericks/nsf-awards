 "awd_abstract_narration": "This condensed matter physics research will develop a fundamental understanding of the spin-charge correlation in magnetic nanostructures. Effects of reduced dimensionality will be explored by investigating spin-dependent electron confinement in momentum space. Effects of magnetic interaction will be investigated in multilayers where the interlayer coupling tunes physical properties such as the magnetic phase transition, the spin reorientation transition, etc. Lateral modulation of a 2D thin film will be studied on vicinal surfaces. A new spherical substrate technique will be applied to control the step orientation and step density in a systematic way. All samples will be grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) and characterized by Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED), Low-Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED), Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES), and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). Electronic properties of the nanostructures will be characterized via Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) and the magnetic properties of the films will be determined by Photoemission Electron Microscopy (PEEM) and Surface Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (SMOKE) techniques. Graduate students will receive training in cutting edge experimental techniques that will prepare them for careers in academe, industry, and government.\r\n\r\nAs the size of materials is reduced to the nanometer scale, the charge and spin of electrons can behave coherently to generate unique magneto-electronic properties that are important to the future information technologies. The goal of this proposal is to develop a deeper understanding of the spin-charge correlation in nanostructures at the fundamental level. To realize this goal, magnetic nanostructures will be fabricated by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) with atomic layer control of the structure. They will be characterized with state-of-the-art techniques, including Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES), Photoemission Electron Microscopy (PEEM), Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), and Surface Magneto-Optic Kerr Effect (SMOKE), etc. The success of this project will be important not only to the understanding of low-dimensional magnetism, but also to the development of magnetic technology. Graduate students involved in the project will receive training in fundamental experimental techniques and cutting edge technology. This training will prepare them for a range of careers in both academe and industry.\r\n",
