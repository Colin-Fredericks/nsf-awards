 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding,  predicting,  and  preventing  collapse  have  always  been  major  objectives  of  earthquake \r\nengineering.  Collapse is the main source of injuries and loss of lives.  Thus, it constitutes an engineering \r\nlimit  state  that  needs  to  be  predicted  in  order  to  evaluate,  in  a  probabilistic  format,  the  life  safety \r\nperformance level, which is of primary societal concern.  In the context of earthquake risk management, a \r\nprocess  is  needed  that  permits  a  rigorous  assessment  of  the  probability  of  collapse  to  make  informed \r\ndecisions in the best interest of society.  In the context of earthquake resistant design, this process needs \r\nto be simplified so that the engineering profession can use engineering techniques, which are based on \r\nparameters  such  as  strength,  stiffness,  and  ductility  (deformability),  to  derive  structural  properties  that \r\ncomply with specified targets for a required level of collapse safety, or a tolerable probability of collapse. \r\nThis project will address both contexts.  It will provide a methodology and reliable data for predicting a \r\ncritical mode of collapse, namely that associated with sidesway instability in which an individual story (or \r\na series of stories) displaces sufficiently so that the second order P-delta effects fully offset the first order \r\nstory  shear  resistance  and  dynamic  instability  occurs,  i.e.,  the  structural  system  loses  its  gravity  load \r\nresistance.  Prediction of this mode of collapse is a challenging problem because structural components \r\nwill deteriorate in strength and stiffness before the collapse limit state is reached, and great uncertainties \r\nare associated with the description of the seismic input and of the parameters that control the response of \r\nstructures close to collapse. \r\nThe methodology will  be  based  on  a  combination  of  analytical  and  experimental  simulations,  with the \r\nformer being carried out at Stanford University and the main effort of the latter, a shaking table collapse \r\ntest of a model of a steel structure, being carried out at the NEES facility at the University at Buffalo.  \r\nThe  outcomes  of  the  proposed  research  will  be  (a)  a methodology  for  predicting  sidesway  collapse of \r\ndeteriorating structural systems, (b) an extensive database on deterioration properties of structural steel \r\nand  reinforced  concrete  components,  including  uncertainty  measures  accounting  for  modeling  and \r\nmaterial uncertainties, (c) incorporation of component deterioration models in the OpenSees platform, (d) \r\ndocumentation of a comprehensive collapse experiment with data that covers the range of response of a 5-\r\nstory steel frame structure from elastic behavior to incipient collapse, (e) a methodology for computing \r\nthe  probability  of  sidesway  collapse  that  accounts  for  hazard,  ground  motion,  and  structural  (material, \r\nmodeling) uncertainties, and (f) engineering recommendations for design for collapse safety. \r\nIntellectural Merit.  The proposed research will lead to seminal advances in understanding and predicting \r\nsidesway collapse of structures subjected to severe earthquakes.  The major challenges are to account for \r\ndeterioration in structural behavior in combination with P-delta effect, and for the uncertainties inherent \r\nin ground motion description and in modeling the behavior of the components that control the dynamic \r\nresponse at large inelastic deformations (or at small deformations in the case of brittle elements).  These \r\nchallenges imply extensive modeling efforts at the component and structure level and the incorporation of \r\nreliability  concepts  in  assessing  collapse  safety  of  structures.    Another  major  challenge  will  be  the \r\nplanning and execution of a shaking table collapse experiment, whose main purpose is to demonstrate that \r\ncollapse  prediction  indeed  is  feasible.    The  research  involves  an  integrated  approach  of  physical \r\nsimulations at a NEES site shaking table and computational simulations on the OpenSees platform, while \r\nfully utilizing the simulation, visualization, and collaboration tools of the NEESgrid. \r\nBroader  Impacts  on  Earthquake  Engineering  Research  and  Practice.  The  research  is  motivated  by \r\nprofessional  needs to  provide  adequate  and consistent  collapse  safety  in  new  designs  and to  assess  the \r\ncollapse  hazard  of  existing  structures.   These  needs  require  the  filling  of  knowledge  gaps  that  exist  in \r\nregard to data and tools and the understanding of collapse phenomena.  The impact of the proposed work \r\non  research  and  practice  will  be  the  development  of  databases,  advanced  deterioration  models,  and \r\ncomputational tools that will make it feasible to predict the collapse safety of complex structures and will \r\npermit  more  rational  allocation  of  resources  in  the  context  of  performance-based  seismic  risk \r\nmanagement.    The  impact  will  be  felt  in  the  academic  environment  in  teaching  and  research,  in \r\nengineering design offices, and in organizations concerned with risk management.",
