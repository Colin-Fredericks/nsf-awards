 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research program focuses on the design, synthesis, and study of bifunctional catalysts containing both Bronsted basic and organometallic (Lewis acidic) sites. Assisted by calculational studies, bifunctional ligands will be designed and synthesized. Following preparation and characterization of transition metal complexes of these ligands, these complexes will be explored in the catalysis of the anti-Markovnikov addition of hydroxylic compounds to alkynes and alkenes, hydration of nitriles, cyclization of alkynols and alkynylamides, addition of terminal alkynes to carbonyl compounds, and hydroamination of alkenes.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, Professor Douglas B. Grotjahn, of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at San Diego State University, is developing new catalysts designed to effect important chemical transformations through two-site interactions. Catalysis enables the efficient and environmentally sound synthesis of organic compounds. By utilizing design principles inspired by Nature's catalysts, the enzymes, Professor Grotjahn's studies promise both new mechanisms for the catalysis of reactions and the creation of catalysts able to effect completely new reactions.",
