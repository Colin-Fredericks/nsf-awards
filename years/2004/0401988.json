 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61).  This project evaluates a model recruitment program that is aimed at attracting students from diverse populations into biotechnology associate degree programs, with the objective of moving students toward successful careers in the field.  In order to address the demand for a 21st century workforce in biotechnology, the project partners this community college with Lexicon Genetics, Inc. and high school teachers and students at the Conroe Independent School District.  It employs recruitment and career awareness programs designed to catch the attention of underrepresented populations, especially from the Hispanic community.  This effort includes: (1) using Biotechnology Clubs in high schools as a novel recruitment tool, (2) building a career-awareness program that employs ethnically matched role models, community dialog and recruitment materials in Spanish and English; (3) offering core biotechnology courses at more accessible times and locations; and (4) providing professional development opportunities for biotechnology educators at the secondary and community college level. The methods used in this project are being evaluated for transferability to other biotechnology programs unable to meet recruitment goals, thereby developing a strategy with possible nation-wide implications.",
