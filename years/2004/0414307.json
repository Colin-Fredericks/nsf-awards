 "awd_abstract_narration": "Industrial ecology focuses on reducing the environmental impacts of goods and services, on systems-based analysis of environmental problems, and on innovations that can significantly improve environmental performance. The Gordon Research Conference on Industrial Ecology is the leading a forum for the discussion and presentation of the latest scientific developments in this field. This grant provides shared funding for the 2004 Gordon Research Conference on Industrial Ecology. Specifically, the funds will be used to support the participation of students, and the participation of scientists from developing countries who would not otherwise be able to attend. \r\n\r\nThis conference provides an opportunity for leading scientists to discuss new research on role of technology in addressing global environmental problems. The conference will help to ensure that research approaches are vetted among a wide group of international scientists, and provides a way for new research results to be discussed among scientists before they are published in the peer-reviewed literature. If successful, this conference will support the development of new research, improved research methods, new collaborations, and a better understanding of the role of technology in simultaneously supporting human well-being and protecting the environment. \r\n",
