They will be undertaking research on string field theory and string geometry.  String theory is the central focus of most current effort in fundamental theoretical particle physics.   The proposed activity focuses on three essential aspects of string theory, i.e. string field theory (SFT), geometrical and topological aspects of string theory, and the AdS/CFT correspondence.  Concerning string field theory, it is proposed to use the Moyal Star Formulation of SFt to construct the supersymmetric theory and develop non-perturbative computational techniques that would help to estimate the true vacuum state and connect the string theory to low energy physics and cosmology.   The finding of the true vacuum state in string theory is one of the most relevant open questions in this area of research.  In addition, the connection of string theory to low energy physics and cosmology is an essential point to test the predictions of string theory.  It is also proposed to continue the current research on applications of topogical string theory to understand perturbative and non-perturbative aspects of superstring compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds as well as of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories arising as limits of these compactifications.  These ideas have important implications, as the computation of gravitational corrections to the superpotentials, which are realized in the gauge theory in a novel fashion, leading to an interesting Lorentz violating photon-graviton coupling, with possible astrophysical consequences.  In addition, there are very important applications in mathematics.  The third aspect of the research involves the AdS/CFT correspondence, which has been one of the central issues of string theory in the last years.  This activity is very important to advancing knowledge and understanding in string/M theory.  \r\n\r\nThis project brings together the efforts of three laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  Results of the research will impact the areas of string theory, particle physics and cosmology.  The expected broader impact of the proposed activities would be in mathematical areas of non-commutative geometry, group theory, and geometry.  Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The project includes the participation of a large number of postdocs and graduate students. Results of the research will be disseminated at scientific meetings and in scientific journals.  \r\n",
