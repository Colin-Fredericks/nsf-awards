This program is extremely aggressive, in depth and breadth, and will provide enough data of sufficiently high quality to answer important questions about galaxy evolution.  As a complement, sophisticated numerical models will identify the particular environments hosting galaxies that will eventually end in various parts of the formed cluster.  Observing galaxies in the succession of loci at different redshifts effectively simulates the impossible task of following the evolution of an individual galaxy through cosmic time.\r\n\r\nThe research will be communicated to a broad audience through public lectures, magazine articles, and radio and television programs.  The Carnegie Observatories are also embarked on an ambitious program of educational outreach, particularly focused on the disadvantaged minority population of its immediate community.  This includes a public lecture series, targeted to the entire community but with associated events for local school children, work with the neighborhood elementary school, and a summer school for minority high school students.",
