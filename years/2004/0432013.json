 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasingly, many aspects of biology can be viewed as involving the processing of information. Modern\r\ninformation and computer science have played an important rolein such major biological accomplishments\r\nas the sequencing of the human genome. On the other hand, biological ideas can inspire new concepts and\r\nmethods in information science. This project is motivated by these two observations. Progress in the field\r\nof biological information processing will require interdisciplinary collaborations among computer scientists,\r\nmathematicians, physicists, chemists, and biologists. The project is built around a series of workshops that\r\nwill enhance the interdisciplinary collaborations beginning to form and introduce outstanding junior people\r\nto problems and topics at the forefront of research.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe project will be organized around a series of workshops with four themes: (1) Algorithmic Approaches\r\nto Biological Information Processing; (2) Computer Science, Engineering and Biology: Applications and\r\nAnalogies; (3) Biological Circuits and Cellular Signaling; (4) Proteomics. Two of these themes represent\r\napproaches and two represent areas of application of these approaches. Under theme 1, planned workshops\r\nare on Detecting and Processing Regularities in High Throughput Biological Data; Machine Learning Ap-\r\nproaches for Understanding Gene Regulation; and Computational Tumor Modeling. Theme 2 workshops will\r\ncover Nanotechnology and Biology; Control, Communication, and Computing in Biology; and The Mecha-\r\nnism and Applications of the RNA Interference Process. For Theme 3, there will be workshops on Strategies\r\nfor Reverse Engineering Biological Circuits; Cell Communication and Information Processing in Developing\r\nTissues; Dynamics of Biological Networks; and Evolution of Gene Regulatory Networks. Theme 4 work-\r\nshops will be on Information Processing by Protein Structures in Molecular Recognition; Proteome Network\r\nEvolution; Functional Proteomics of Neurodegenerative Diseases; and Implications of Mathematical Models\r\nof Infection and Molecular Modeling of Hepatitis B Virus. We expect that the workshops, scientific papers\r\nand books coming out of the project will help to develop the long-term focus of the field, carefully define\r\nproblems and directions in computer science, mathematics, chemistry, andphysics of specific interest to and\r\ndesigned in collaboration with biologists, and lead to new biological concepts that will in uence biological\r\nand information science research in the future. In short, we expect the project to in uence the study of\r\nbiological information processing for years to come.\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe ideas developed in this project will have impact on a myriad of fields and create cross-disciplinary\r\nconnections. A visitor program will encourage senior and junior researchers, including students, to participate\r\nin collaborative research spawned by the workshops. Each workshop will have a fund for support of graduate\r\nstudents and postdocs amd workshops will have a substantial educational component through talks of a\r\ntutorial/expository nature. The topic lends itself well to undergraduate research and participating faculty\r\nwill coordinate topics with an undergraduate research program (REU program) already in existence. To give\r\nthe project widespread dissemination, each workshop will have awebsite with relevant references, problems,\r\nand copies of presentations that can make it a resource for a large community. The project should significantly\r\nin uence the careers of a large number of outstanding junior researchers and it should play an important\r\nrole in the training and development of scientists who are well-prepared to become leaders in the field of\r\nbiological information processing. The project is expected to have a long-term impact well beyond its four\r\nyear duration since the workshop, visitor, and dissemination components of the project will allow the ideas\r\ndeveloped to reach hundreds of people nationwide and worldwide.",
