 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of this project is to improve the community's understanding of the aerosol indirect (or secondary aerosol) effect through examination of the role of carbonaceous material.  Laboratory and field experimental activities will be combined with numerical modeling exercises.  A new method for characterizing cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) will be developed that combines size resolved measurements of surface tension, critical supersaturation and chemical composition, which will allow determination of the effects of organic species on CCN properties in near real time.  The observations made with the new technique will be incorporated into a numerical module designed to simulate aerosol-cloud interactions which when incorporated into global climate models can be used to assess indirect forcing.\r\n\r\nThe project will expose undergraduate engineers and scientists to atmospheric research.  The PI will expose gifted high school students to atmospheric science with the goal to inspire them to a career in science and engineering.  Two Ph.D. students will be given experimental and numerical modeling experiences.  There are a number of formal education and outreach programs (e.g. SURE and STEP) at the PI's home institution that will be exploited in this project.  Societal benefits are likely with improved understanding of the atmospheric chemical-climate system.  The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international scientific conferences.",
