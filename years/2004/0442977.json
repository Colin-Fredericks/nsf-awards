Alcantar (Engineering-USF), Elena Centeno (Geology-UNAM), Karla Davis-Salazar (Anthropology-USF), Rafael Huizar (Geology-UNAM), Babu Joseph (Engineering-USF), Michel Picquart (Physics- UAM), Mark Steward (Geology-USF), Tomas Viveros (Industrial Engineering-UAM)\r\nThe objectives of this BE/ MUSES planning grant are to develop a water purification system based on an economically viable \"green technology\", investigate its applicability to a rural community in Mexico, and generate a plan of action for a full MUSES proposal. The goals are to produce an economically feasible method of water purification using cactus mucilage and silicate arrays for low-income inhabitants of rural communities that are sensitive to existing economic, social, and cultural patterns. This project transcends national boundaries as it includes collaborations between investigators at the University of South Florida (USF), two leading Mexican public universities: the 'Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico' (UNAM) and the 'Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana' (UAM), and the National Institute of the Environment (INE) in Mexico. The proposed area of study is the rural community of Temamatla in central Mexico. Its location (25mi/40 km southeast of Mexico City) is critical for this study owing to its proximity to volcanic soils where the concentration of heavy metals such as cobalt, mercury, nickel, copper, zinc, iron, manganese, chromium, iodine, arsenic, molybdenum, and lead in local water supplies may be higher than recommended values. The broader implications of this project include the multidisciplinary participation of American and Mexican researchers in issues that are relevant to both countries owing to their proximity and preexisting ties. Such collaboration will promote mutual opportunities and infrastructure for research, education, training, networking, future partnerships, and most importantly, the proposed technology will improve current water-related issues and problems in areas of extreme need. This award will be managed by Tom Waite, BES / ENG and Robert Wellek, CTS / ENG. \r\n",
