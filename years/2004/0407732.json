Several aspects will be studied, including\r\nnonlinear stability of cosmological spacetimes, as well as the\r\nnonlinear stability of various versions of the Einstein equations\r\nfor spacetimes with one spatial Killing field. Studies of the\r\nasymptotic behavior near spacetime singularities will be carried\r\nout, with particular attention to aspects of the BKL proposal and\r\nasymptotic silence. Here a combination of numerical and\r\nanalytical methods will be used.  Elliptic gauge formulations for\r\nthe Einstein equations will be investigated. These are of\r\ninterest for large scale numerical computations, as well as for\r\nthe Cauchy problem for rough initial data.\r\n\r\nThe Einstein equations describe the geometry of spacetime, which\r\nin turn determines the motion of bodies (planets, stars,\r\ngalaxies) in space, as well as the dynamics of fields and\r\nparticles via their respective field theories. The geometric view\r\nof the universe provided by the Einstein equations has led to\r\nsome of the most fundamental and paradoxical features of our\r\npicture of the universe, including the initial spacetime\r\nsingularity or Big Bang and black holes. The mathematical study\r\nof spacetimes in extreme conditions such as near the Big Bang\r\nsingularity or near the singularity in black holes has led to a\r\nfar reaching conjecture called ``Cosmic Censorship'', which\r\nimplies that phenomena which violate the intuitive notions of\r\ncausality must be hidden (censored) from observers. In this\r\nproject, problems related to cosmic censorship are studied using\r\na combination of computer based and analytical techniques, with a\r\nparticular focus on the evolution of geometry from initial\r\nconditions.\r\n",
