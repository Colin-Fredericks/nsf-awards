Cooper\r\n\r\nInstitution:  \t  \t\tTemple University\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to substantially expand the utility of enzyme catalysis for environmentally benign alternatives to chemical catalysis syntheses.  Present barriers to wider applications of biocatalysis stem in part to the high cost of purified enzymes, such as peroxidase, coupled with the requirements for large volumes of materials.  Use of organic solvents also is prevalent.  However, if waste biomaterials could be used as the source of the enzymes, dramatic cost reductions would be achieved.  This project would explore promising potential replacements for lyophilized peroxidases, including plant peroxidases derived from horseradish and soybeans.  The key high-risk component of the research is the utilization of in situ extraction with the evaluation of the effects of the extraction solvents on enzymatic and catalytic activity.  Both aqueous/organic mixtures and room temperature ionic liquids will be utilized for extraction and synthesis.  Polymerization of 3-phenylphenol will be used to evaluate the activity of the enzymes.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the research include new avenues to environmentally and economically sustainable alternatives for biocatalysis synthesis.  Publication will be through peer-reviewed journals.  A strong K-12 outreach activity will be utilized.  The project ensures strong participation of underrepresented groups. The combination of the extraction and synthesis environments would be a major advance in this area, and possible industrial applications would be very significant.  \r\n\r\n",
