Over the past decade, another approach \r\nto data analysis has been evolving in applied mathematics, computer science, and \r\nstatistics that some have called ``algorithmic.''  There is usually no effort to construct a \r\nmodel of how the data were generated. The goal is to link a set of inputs to one or more \r\noutputs so that some clear objective function is optimized by a computer algorithm. This \r\nproposal focuses on ``ensemble methods,'' which are an especially promising special case \r\nof algorithmic methods. The goal this is to help foster more effective interactions \r\nbetween the developers of ensemble methods and empirical researchers in the behavioral, \r\nsocial, and economic sciences. The approach is to apply, using real data sets, ensemble \r\nmethods to important social science data analysis problems. These include 1) evaluation \r\nprocedures for complex computer simulations, 2) diagnostic procedures for conventional \r\nstatistical models, 3) adjustments for confounding in observational studies, and 4) \r\nclassification and prediction exercises when the response variable is highly skewed. In \r\neach case, the performance of the ensemble methods will be compared to the \r\nperformance of conventional modeling using ten assessment criteria detailed in the \r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed application of ensemble methods to real data sets should have several \r\nbroad benefits for the behavioral, social and economic sciences, as well as for the \r\nmathematical and statistical sciences. Powerful and rapidly developing data analysis \r\ntools, under the broad rubric of \"data mining,\" will be applied to difficult data analysis \r\nproblems. These exercises will illustrate strengths and weakness of ensemble methods for \r\ncertain kinds of demanding empirical research. This experience will help inform the \r\nbehavioral, social, and economic sciences about when ensemble methods can be useful \r\nand what their limitations can be. Equally important, the applications will provide a  ``test \r\nbed'' for a variety of ensemble methods from which will likely emerge potential \r\nrefinements in existing ensemble procedures and new technical questions insufficiently \r\naddressed in the current literature.  Thus, the mathematical and statistical sciences can \r\nbenefit as well. Finally, each of the data sets to be used is potentially rich in substantive \r\nimplications.  Although the emphasis in this proposal is methodological, it is entirely \r\npossible that the data analyses to be undertaken will also be instructive from subject-\r\nmatter perspective.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",
