 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is designed to build evaluation capacity among agricultural, environmental education, and natural resource management organizations. The mechanism for achieving this goal is an intensive summer institute in program evaluation. The lack of courses addressing the contexts in which the target professionals work produced the demand for the training.  Development of training materials including videotapes, case studies, and readings as well as summer salaries and scholarship support for participants with demonstrated financial need are the primary funding requirements.  Faculty leaders in evaluation and in the relevant disciplines will collaborate in the project. The workshop focus addresses core competencies of all evaluators and unique content with respect to multidisciplinary subject matter, indicators and standards for monitoring in the target contexts, and hand-on minds-on instructional strategies. The unique collaboration provides an opportunity for capacity building joining STEM disciplines and evaluation methodologists in development of context-relevant training.",
