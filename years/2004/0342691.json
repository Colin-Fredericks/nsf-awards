 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapidly intensifying coastal storms develop along the Mid-Atlantic States during fall, winter and spring months.  These extratropical cyclones produce gale force winds, heavy snow, ice, and coastal storm surges with intense beach erosion and are responsible for severe property damage and often loss of lives along the eastern seaboard.  Previous studies have improved understanding of the east coast winter storms, but have also raised several important questions on the role of the surface processes related to the Gulf Stream and their eddies on the genesis of these storms.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this research is to investigate the influence of the Gulf Stream and its warm core eddies on east coast winter storms.  This will be achieved (1) by investigating the relative roles of factors such as position and shape of the Gulf Stream on the development of wintertime east coast storms, and (2) by studying the interaction between the upper level and surface forcing.\r\n\r\nResults from this research will improve the understanding of the surface processes involved in the genesis or redevelopment of east coast winter cyclones.  A better understanding of theses processes in relation to the Gulf Stream meander and warm core eddy will provide an additional tool to forecasters and help in the mitigation of disasters associated with these storms in the eastern corridor from South Carolina to Massachusetts and the population centers of this region. \r\n\r\nThis study will involve research experience and learning opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at NCSU and the research findings will be discussed in undergraduate and graduate classes.  The Principal Investigator is the State Climatologist for North Carolina and directs the State Climate Office of North Carolina, a Public Service / Extension center.  The findings will be transmitted to the public and non -technical audience, and will also be available for use by federal, state and local agencies for disaster mitigation and emergency preparedness activities.",
