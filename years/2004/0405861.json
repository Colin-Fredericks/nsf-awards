 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 46th Annual Maize Genetics Conference offers members of the maize community the opportunity to present and discuss their most recent research results.  A wide range of topics are covered, ranging from classical to molecular genetics.  The 46th Annual meeting will feature 45-minute talks by four invited speakers, 15 minute talks given by individual participants, two poster sessions, and two workshops.  The topics of the invited talks include glucose regulation in plants, phosphorous stress responses in Arabidopsis and maize, bridging genomics and breeding with maize diversity, and the mechanism of hAT element transposition.  The workshops will be on maize genetic diversity and sequencing the maize gene space.  The Maize Genetics Conference provides an outstanding opportunity for graduate students to meet and interact with scientists in the field, to discuss their research ideas at talks or posters, and to begin to establish the scientific networks that will prove invaluable throughout their careers.  The Mexican venue of this year's meeting should encourage greater attendance by Latin American scientists and thus provide a platform for international interactions.  To encourage student participation, the Conference defrays the cost of attendance for a number of graduate students (approximately 100).",
