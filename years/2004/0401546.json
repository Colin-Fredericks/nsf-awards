 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary \r\nThe Geological Society of America (GSA) has been approached by the Biogeosciences Working Group \r\nand asked to prepare a proposal to design, build and host an independent, stand-alone Web site in support \r\nof the entire biogeoscience community. In Task I, www.biogeoscience.org is envisioned as a conduit \r\nthrough which information would flow to the biogeoscience community from funding agencies, program \r\nmanagers, societies, and others. In Task II, the Web site would be enhanced and expanded to support \r\ncommunity building and dialog that will help guide and shape scientific discourse. At this time, GSA is \r\nseeking funding for Task I of the project. \r\n \r\nPresently, there is no single source of information about biogeoscience funding opportunities, current \r\nresearch, centers of activity and other important resources. There is a need for a clearinghouse, a principle \r\nsource of information about the biogeosciences. A wealth of information is available, and an easy to use, \r\nmain source of up-to-date information is needed.  \r\n \r\nDefining the architecture and constructing the Web site will be the responsibility of a project team \r\ncomposed of members of the Biogeosciences Working Group, GSA staff and a student intern. The project \r\nteam will conduct most of its work via teleconference and E-mail and may hold face-to-face meetings \r\nduring scientific meetings attended by members of the team. \r\n \r\nIn Task I, the Web site would function as an information resource. A wide range of information would be \r\nposted, updated frequently, and made compelling with features on research, people or programs. Other \r\ncontent that will pull traffic would be job postings and funding announcements.  An important Task I \r\nfunction is search capability that will make the Web site as useful as possible to site visitors. In addition, \r\nthe site would contain meta tags to ensure that search engines would easily find it. \r\n \r\nIn Task II, it is envisioned that the Web site would become an interactive, community-building, dialog site. \r\nThe Working Group has identified three broad topics that it will examine and about which it needs input \r\nfrom the community. Initially, these topics will be the focus of input sought from the community. \r\n \r\nGSA is very well qualified to undertake this project for the Working Group with NSF support. GSA has \r\nmany years of experience with creating and developing useful, easily navigated, and very attractive Web \r\nsites. GSA continually adds functionality and interactivity to its own Web site, www.geosociety.org.  GSA \r\nis thoroughly familiar with the geoscience community and can bring much knowledge about the needs, \r\nwants and preferences of the community to the project.  \r\n \r\nwww.biogeosciences.org will serve this emerging science in several ways: it will attract new researchers to \r\nthe biogeosciences, support those already in the field, and help both the biogeosciences and its scientists \r\nflourish. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
