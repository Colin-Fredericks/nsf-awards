 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to improve information-access systems for large digital collections by incorporating metadata about the documents' genres. Genre metadata facilitates information retrieval and use. For example, people rarely have to read every word to understand documents' meaning. Instead, they start by identifying the kinds of documents they are faced with, and then use different types of documents in appropriate ways. For example, a grant proposal is used differently from a syllabus, a product brochure or a bank statement. Information-access systems would be more useful for many tasks if they could similarly distinguish the form and purpose of documents (that is, their genres).\r\n\r\nThe study includes a series of human-centered studies of information use by K-12 teachers to develop an understanding of genre and its role in information use. Based on these studies, the researchers develop a taxonomy of relevant genres and the features that identify each. The study includes the development and preliminary testing of genre-enhanced interface prototypes for information access tools. The study provides an understanding of the role of document genre in information-based tasks, evidence of the level of utility of genre metadata in improving user performance on those tasks and development of methods for studying genre.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the study include a reusable classification of genres, enhancing the infrastructure for research and advancement of the domain of education, both in the population targeted by the studies (K-12 teachers) and by including students in the research. The project Web site (http://crowston.syr.edu/genre/) provides access to more information.\r\n",
