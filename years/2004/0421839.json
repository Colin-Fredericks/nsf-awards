 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides a continuation for the University of Arizona Industry/University Cooperative Research for Water Quality.  The center investigates physical, chemical and microbial processes that affect the quality of surface and subsurface waters including potable supplies.  Good quality drinking water is defined as \"water with acceptable purity, taste, and odor characteristics, which is safe with respect to human health and welfare.\"  \r\n\r\nThe overall goals of the Center are:  1) to improve the flow of scientific knowledge that affects water quality, from the University of Arizona to industry, government agencies, and the general public; 2) to develop support for water quality research; 3) to provide graduate students with a broad industry perspective; 4) to inform and educate the public regarding water quality issues; and 5) to ultimately achieve self-sufficiency by bonding with long-term industry and government partners.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the research has focused on the following six areas:  Water Security; Fate and Remediation of Commercial Industrial Contamination; Agrochemical Products and Practices that Influence Water Quality; Municipal Waste Treatment and Reuse; Mining; and Potable Water Quality. \r\n",
