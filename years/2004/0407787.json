 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant would allow CIT to capacity build in the STEM curricular areas as we develop \r\nthe breadth and depth of assorted associate degrees.  Student recruitment and retention \r\nwill be enhanced through innovative strategies applicable to a population that has \r\nhistorically been excluded from opportunities in mainstream STEM programs. \r\n \r\nScientific/Intellectual Merit: The learning laboratory, classrooms, and science labs will \r\nbe equipped with scientific and technological equipment that will make the educating of \r\nstudents in STEM courses possible and allow CIT to become a more noticeable presence \r\non the Navajo Nation.  The grant will provide enhancement of existing and development \r\nof new learning and teaching strategies such as internships, cooperative exchanges, paid \r\nresearch experiences, and research exchanges with federal labs and universities. \r\n  Faculty research capacity capabilities will be  developed now that  CIT is a \r\ncandidate for accreditation and strives to become accredited.  Such progress would allow \r\nCIT  to compete for additional funding from research agencies and organizations in the \r\nfuture.  Existing unique programs such as veterinary technician, nursing, dental assistant \r\nand environmental sciences will be able to reach full accreditation by their professional \r\norganizations as well.    Funding from the NSF/TCUP program will assure that these \r\nprograms will be successful.  The Institute.s programs fill a unique vocational/technical \r\nniche in the educational opportunities available to Native American Indian students. \r\n \r\nChief Manuelito, a Navajo Leader of the 1860s, is on record as having spoken of \r\neducation as a ladder toward a brighter and more prosperous future. \r\n \r\nProgram  Impact:  The NSF funded project would allow CIT to develop badly needed \r\ninfrastructure to meet its mission of providing a quality technical/vocational education to \r\nits students.   The  capacity building embedded in this proposal would move  CIT into a \r\nleadership  capacity by allowing us to broaden degree and certificate program offerings.  \r\nAlso we would be  able  to  address  the  critical  shortage of  students entering  into STEM \r\ncontent fields through better recruitment and retention efforts.",
