 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is concerned with the approximate solution of systems\r\nof nonlinear elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations posed\r\non complicated domains.  Such problems are used to model a wide variety\r\nof physical phenomena in various fields of engineering, mathematics, and\r\nscience. Particular applications considered in this project arise in\r\nchemical electrostatics, in the topological classification of general\r\nsurfaces in geometric analysis, and in semiconductor physics.  Common\r\ncharacteristics of such nonlinear problems presenting hurdles to\r\ncomputational science include: multi-domain and time-dependent domains,\r\nmulti-scale and multi-physics, and potential loss of regularity and blowup.\r\nIn this project, the investigator plans to develop some fundamental mathematical \r\ntools for dealing with these difficulties that will have a wide range of\r\napplicability.\r\n\r\nThe results of this project will have a broad impact in mathematics\r\nas well as in science and engineering.  In this project, the investigator is \r\nfocused on applications in geometric analysis that are used to address fundamental\r\nquestions in geometry, and on applications to highly complex mathematical\r\nmodels arising in modern biology, chemistry, and physics.  However, the\r\ncomputational difficulties associated with complicated, multidimensional\r\ndomains and multi-scaled, multi-physics differential equations that require\r\nnew computational approaches arise in many contexts.  The methods developed\r\nhere will contribute to the advancement of numerical methods for complex\r\nthree dimensional nonlinear dynamical simulations.  The simulation\r\ntechnology we produce will provide exciting and powerful tools for the\r\nexploration of models in physics, chemistry, and biology, as well as in\r\nsome areas of pure mathematics such as geometric analysis.\r\n",
