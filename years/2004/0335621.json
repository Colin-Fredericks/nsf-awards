 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit: The investigators propose to develop an evaluation model that will (1) include multiple methodological traditions, multiple evaluation theories, and multiple stakeholder perspectives and interests; (2) explicitly engage complex, socio-political issues of diversity, difference, equity, and justice, specifically as they relate to historical underrepresentation of individuals from particular demographic groups in science and mathematics related educational and career tracks-notably, females, people of color, people with disabilities, and residents of rural and other under-served areas; (3) engage critical contexts of contemporary educational reform and emphasize challenges of context for meaningful STEM program designs and activities; and (4) incorporate meaningful applications of technology.\r\n \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The model will further understanding of how to enable and enhance meaningful student learning among all students, with particular attention to those traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields and thus to issues of equity and fairness in STEM policies, programs, and practices. The evaluation model has unique potential to not only assess the quality, effectiveness, and equity of STEM educational programs, but also to help constitute better, more equitable programs\r\n",
