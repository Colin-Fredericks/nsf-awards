 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important and visible trend in empirical science today is\r\nthe increasing prevalence of large data sets that contain from thousands to\r\nhundreds of millions of measurements.  Examples include data sets arising\r\nfrom high throughput measurement techniques such as gene expression arrays,\r\nproteomics and computer network monitoring.  While the analysis of large\r\ndata sets is important to scientists, it is often outside the realm of\r\nclassical statistical methods, and frequently presents new conceptual and\r\ncomputational challenges.  The funded research has two principle parts.  In\r\nthe first, the investigators are studying the application of a relatively\r\nnew development in the field of Data Mining, known as subspace clustering,\r\nto the exploratory statistical analysis of high dimensional data.  In the\r\nsecond, the investigators are applying ideas from Statistics and Probability\r\nto the development of new subspace clustering methods, and to rigorous\r\nmathematical analyses of their results.  Research is being carried out in\r\nthe context of ongoing collaborations with biological scientists, and is\r\nbeing incorporated in software that will be used by the collaborating\r\nscientists to identify and assess significant sample-variable\r\nassociations in a variety of large data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn important and visible trend in empirical science today \r\nis the increasing prominence of large data sets that contain from\r\nthousands to hundreds of millions of\r\nmeasurements.  Examples include data sets arising from high throughput\r\nmeasurement techniques such as gene expression arrays, proteomics and\r\ncomputer network monitoring.  Whereas small to moderate data sets typically\r\nhave more samples than measurements, in large data sets it is common to have\r\nmore measurements than samples, so-called ``high dimension and low sample\r\nsize''.  The investigators are studying the application of data mining\r\nmethods known as subspace clustering to the exploratory analysis of high\r\ndimensional data.  Subspace clustering identifies distinguished sample\r\nvariable interactions (submatrices) in a given data matrix.  Unlike standard\r\ntwo-way clustering, the sample and variable sets for different clusters can\r\noverlap.  The investigators are investigating the noise sensitivity of\r\nexisting subspace clustering algorithms, and are developing and\r\nimplementing new subspace clustering methods for average based selection\r\ncriteria that are better suited for applications where noise is present.\r\nAs an application of these methods, they are using subspace clusters to\r\nclassify high dimensional data.  Using a variety of tools from combinatorial\r\nprobability, the investigators are also developing a rigorous theoretical\r\nframework in which multiple testing and the statistical significance of\r\nsubspace clusters can be addressed.  The funded research is being carried out\r\nin the context of ongoing collaborations with biologists and computer\r\nscientists.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
