 "awd_abstract_narration": "Expediting computations by operating in the quantum mechanical regime is\r\nan intriguing idea. Apparently, some problems can be solved much faster by\r\nquantum algorithms than by any randomized algorithm. The main thrust of\r\nthis proposal is to derive design methods for fast quantum algorithms, and\r\nto study various applications such as pattern recognition and communication\r\nproblems. The main objectives of the proposed research are\r\n  the development of design methods for quantum circuits;\r\n  the development of design principles for quantum algorithms;\r\n  the application of such methods to pattern recognition applications;\r\n  and the development of primitives for quantum communications.\r\nThe project is integrated with an educational plan which supports the goals\r\nthe the PI's department. The objectives of the educational plan are\r\n  the further development of a course on quantum algorithms;\r\n  the development of a new course on randomized algorithms;\r\n  the development of experimental components and new material for\r\ncourses in Information, Secrecy, and Authentication;\r\n  an outreach component which explains and animates quantum algorithms\r\nand protocols in the form of a virtual tour.\r\nThe educational plan includes the continued improvement of the course materials\r\nfor the above courses.\r\nThe PI will organize an interdepartmental Quantum Computing Seminar\r\nand two mini-symposia so that students, faculty, and participants from local\r\nindustry get informed about the latest research in quantum computing.\r\nThe project provides opportunities for one undergraduate student and two\r\ngraduate students to participate in the research.",
