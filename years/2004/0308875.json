 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will spend a year  in Departments of  Radiology and Genetics at Case Western Reserve University.   During this  period,  the PI will attend some courses, seminars and spend some time with research groups\r\nfrom MRI, nuclear medicine (PET), anticancer drugs  and genetics.  She will  conduct  related research,  develop  new  research projects  and collaborations  of interest to  her.  In particular, they will develop\r\nnew image reconstruction and segmentation tools that take an advantage of  the state-of-the-art simultaneous  PET  and MRI  imaging,  and new techniques that are helpful for finding disease genes from large data.  The PI will also   attend  professional conferences, and make short visits to national  centers, and other top departments  with international and national reputation.\r\n\r\nThe new research is interdisciplinary  among  medicine, imaging,  genetics and statistics.  The advances in these areas will impact our knowledge of science.  The PI will continue supervising her Ph.D. students and enrich their educational experiences in bioinformatics and imaging.   The new computational tools will be made available via webpages and integrated to her modern data analysis classes and statistical computing class after the grant period.\r\n\r\nThis IGMS project is jointly supported by the MPS Office of  Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA) and the Division of  Mathematical Sciences (DMS).",
