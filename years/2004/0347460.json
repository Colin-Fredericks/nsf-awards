 "awd_abstract_narration": "Next generation communication systems will integrate mobile ad hoc networks, wireless mesh networks, and all-IP cellular networks into hybrid networks.  Key features of these systems are the multiplicity of access technologies and the diversity of nodes to facilitate always best connected (ABC) communication and pervasive computing. The survivability of hybrid networks is of paramount importance to homeland security, where the networks must fulfill their missions in a timely manner even in the presence of failures or attacks. This project aims to (1) develop hybrid routing protocols where portions of  the same route span both infrastructure components and multi-hop wireless components of different networking characteristics, (2) integrate control with computing and communication to harness mobility and control trajectory to achieve eventual connectivity, (3) design hybrid transport mechanisms that cope with asymmetry, and (4) develop utility-based congestion control algorithms that maximize the aggregate transport utility over  wireless networks. The project is investigating integrated solutions and pursuing cross-layer design, and will yield theory, algorithms, and protocols that help enhance capacity and survivability of hybrid networks. In addition, the educational activities of the project are to integrate control with computing and communication into mobile wireless networking curricula to foster the next phase of the information technology revolution, and to develop tools such as protocol animations to help comprehend protocol concepts, simulation exercises to help learn a complex simulator, and methodology for simulation and performance evaluation.  The results will be disseminated and will be of value to both the educational community and industry.",
