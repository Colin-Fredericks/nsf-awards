 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program provides funds to Harvey Mudd College for the acquisition of a versatile, low temperature physical measurement system. The instrument is equipped with high magnetic field capability and an open architecture that will provide a system adaptable to a broad spectrum of transport, magnetization, and thermodynamic measurement techniques. The researchers will be able to study the interaction of ultra thin antiferromagnetic layers with ferromagnetic materials, the effect of seed layer and capping layer on exchange coupling, the temperature dependence of the spin diffusion length in magnetic and nonmagnetic materials, and half-metallic ferromagnets.  Harvey Mudd College is an undergraduate science and engineering college with a tradition in training leaders in the technical fields. An extensive research experience is considered to be an essential part of that educational process. Undergraduate students will be trained in the interdisciplinary field of magnetic materials research.   \r\n\r\nThis award from the Major Research Instrumentation program will support the magnetic materials group at Harvey Mudd College with the acquisition of a versatile, low temperature system.
