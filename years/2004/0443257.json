 "awd_abstract_narration": "The optical network is a promising high-speed backbone or transportation network that requires\r\nan extremely caution in operations. The reconfiguration is one of the indispensable operations if a\r\nvirtual topology no longer serves a traffic demand which is changed over time.\r\n   We propose to develop an algorithm and a complete reconfiguration model for wavelengthrouted\r\noptical networks which includes the reconfiguration process and the policy. The reconfiguration\r\nprocess provides the choices of the reconfiguration operations (e.g., add, delete or re-route\r\nlightpaths) to maintain the high performance of the network in any traffic demand volumes and\r\npatterns while minimally disturbs the current virtual topology. The reconfiguration policy defines\r\nwhich choice to be selected that returns the optimal expected outcome based on the cost of operation\r\nand the performance reward. We have preliminary experimental results that show that selecting\r\nthe choice with the highest immediate outcome does not return the optimal expected outcome in\r\nthe long term.\r\n   Although the reconfiguration problem is an NP-hard problem and is a trade-off between performance\r\nand number of changes in virtual topology, we can still find the solutions using a multiobjective\r\nevolutionary algorithm with the concept of Pareto Optimal. The algorithm provides a set\r\nof solutions in the Pareto front while the policy picks one of solutions in the Pareto front that gains\r\nthe optimal expected outcome. The policy depends on the pattern of traffic. If the future pattern\r\nof traffic can be predicted or estimated, the Markov Decision Process (MDP) can define the policy.\r\nHowever, the status of network or the MDP's state which effects the Pareto front needs an intensive\r\nstudy.\r\n   Our goal is to develop the theory and algorithms in accordance with realistic traffic demand and\r\nprotocol. The model will be the centralized control over the network, which will not be designed\r\nonly for the specific performance objective or traffic type but be applicable for various objectives\r\nand traffic types. The development of practical algorithms for solving these problems represent an\r\nimportant step in allowing reasonable scale implementation of optical networks.\r\n   Intellectual Merit of the proposed research rests on the integration between the reconfiguration\r\nprocess and the policy based on the Pareto optimal concept and MDP that has not yet happened in\r\nthe Optical network reconfiguration field. Reconfiguration problems are among the most difficult\r\nin the areas of optical networks since such problems encompass the construction of algorithms\r\ninvolving the extremely high-speed communication over an optical fiber. The consequence problem\r\nis how or when to perform the reconfiguration process. From the practical application viewpoint,\r\nwe want to advance our model to the practical optical networks.\r\n   Broader Impacts of the proposed research is expected to be strong since we are proposing\r\nto integrate two disciplines, the evolutionary computing and the stochastic process for the recon-\r\nfiguration in the optical networks. We expect that the work will have broad impact in industrial\r\npractices on network provisioning, protection and restoration areas.\r\n",
