The opportunity for student research internships is a new component of MIT's international program in India, which currently supports internships in industry and teaching.  Funding from NSF's Office of International Science & Engineering will enable nine MIT graduate students to undertake traineeships at six of India's leading centers of research and higher education.  The program is designed to integrate trainees into groundbreaking research at India's finest institutions, allow them to explore careers in research, and finally, become globally experienced early on in their education and training.  \r\n\r\nScope:  The PI is well connected with Indian institutions/researchers and has recently completed a term as visiting professor at the Nehru Centre for Advanced Studies, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.  His collaborations with Indian colleagues at the IISc, the Indian Institute of Information Technology, the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), and the National Centre for Biological Sciences have lead to the development of internships in leading edge areas of telecommunications, information technology, genomics, and neurobiology.  In addition to providing a unique research experience for MIT graduate students, this award contributes to internationalizing the U.S. workforce, making U.S. students globally competitive, and creating scientific networks of lasting value.      \r\n\r\n",
