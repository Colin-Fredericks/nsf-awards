The symposium title is \"Educating Tomorrow's Scientists and Engineers\". This symposium has run continuously since 1996, it is currently held every 18 months at the Fall or Spring MRS meeting. This year's symposium includes sessions on innovating teaching through the introduction of, among others, nanoscience and nanotechnology to the undergraduate curriculum, teaching\r\ncomputational materials and improving the programs available to the K-12 curriculum. Symposium attendees include educators from four-year colleges and universities, people associated with industry, and people who work closely with K-12 teachers. Both undergraduate and graduate students can benefit form an improved curriculum. In the K-12 area, materials researchers can benefit from education partnerships with teachers that introduce materials science in the physics and chemistry pre-college curriculum.\r\n",
