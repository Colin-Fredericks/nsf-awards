 "awd_abstract_narration": "The nascent field of synthetic biology is focused on creating small synthetic genetic networks\r\ninserting them into living cells in order to \"program\" cellular behavior. Recent prototypes include\r\na toggle switch, an oscillator, logic gates, concentration band detectors, and even a pulse\r\ngenerator. Synthetic gene networks are foreseen to have tremendous applications in\r\nbiotechnology, medicine, and defense related areas. Such engineered biological devices will\r\nengage in simple computations and cell-cell communications to diagnose diseases, repair tissues,\r\ndetect and clean up environmental pollutants, and manufacture biomaterials.\r\nThe main challenge in synthetic biology is creating and tuning gene networks to desired\r\nspecifications. There is currently no formal mechanism to guarantee the behavior of these systems\r\nand to tune their parameters a-priori to satisfy desired performances. The existing tools for formal\r\nanalysis cannot handle genetic networks successfully due to nonlinearities, uncertainties, scarce\r\nknowledge of kinetic and regulatory parameters, and measurements corrupted by noise. However,\r\nthe adoption of synthetic gene networks in critical applications such as tissue engineering requires\r\nthat these systems meet strict safety guarantees.\r\nIn this project, we propose a hybrid systems approach to forward engineer and analyze synthetic\r\ngenetic networks. In this framework, interval-based specifications translate to reachability\r\nanalysis and safety verification, which are the central problems of formal analysis. By exploiting\r\nthe particular nonlinearities induced by chemical reactions and cooperative regulations, we first\r\nreduce these infinite dimensional problems to finite searches on graphs by constructing discrete\r\nabstractions, and then map them to parameter value intervals. This procedure will allow for\r\nanalysis under parameter uncertainty and will provide a provably correct methodology to tune the\r\nparameters to achieve desired interval-based properties. We will validate our approach with two\r\nexperimental systems. We will improve the steady state digital response of a transcriptional\r\ncascade and use the optimized cascades to build more robust toggle switches. We will also use\r\nformal analysis to fine-tune the dynamic behavior of a pulse generator that incorporates cell-cell\r\ncommunication and a feed-forward motif.",
