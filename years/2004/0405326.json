 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project embodies a fundamental materials science study of inorganic and organic interfaces that have technological significance in electronics/photonics. Building on results of previous studies that focused on key microelectronics reactions of oxidation and nitridation of Si and the organic polymer film poly o-methoxyaniline (POMA) on SiO2 covered Si, this research is extended to include complex inorganic oxide interfaces that have relevance for high dielectric constant (K) insulators, and for ferroelectrics and piezoelectrics, and to combine selected organic films that are p-type semiconductors with stable n-type organic semiconductors to fabricate and characterize prototype device structures made from novel interfaces. The fundamental materials science issue is to understand the nature and extent of interface reactions and then to assess the impact of the chemical/physical nature of the interface with resultant interfacial electronic properties as determined from well-characterized interfaces. The research strategy is to follow the evolution of interface formation in real time via in situ real-time ellipsometry as well as other situ real-time characterization methodologies to provide assessments of chemical composition, structure and optical properties. Interface sensitive characterization techniques such as spectroscopic immersion ellipsometry, fractal analysis, and Fowler-Nordheim tunnel current oscillations will be included. Several interface and thin film preparation processes will be utilized: thermal, and ion sputtering for inorganic interfaces and chemical and electrochemical solution methods for organic films. \r\n%%% \r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The research topic, specifically interfaces formed with high dielectric constant and ferroelectric materials, and the emerging field of organic electronic materials is critical to future progress in nanoscale electronics. An important feature of the project is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. This research activity provides training of graduate and undergraduate students and post doctorals in an industrially relevant area of research. The research is collaborative with participants that include university students from the University of North Carolina and James Madison University (Prof. B. Augustine with an ROA), national laboratory collaborator (Dr. O. Auciello at ANL), and a small business owner (Dr. A. Schultz of Ionwerks Inc.). Participants share their differing perspectives, students get experience in different professional environments, and research results can be readily implemented in industry and government. Students will also be able to participate in research conducted in the new National Center for Nanomaterials (CNM) in progress at ANL.  The PI has successfully recruited and graduated students from underrepresented groups, and will continue to do so. It is anticipated that all participating students will have made presentations at international meetings during their degree time and will have published several papers in refereed international journals.\r\n*** \r\n",
