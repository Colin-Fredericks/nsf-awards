 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nBleher\r\n\r\nThis research project is directed on fundamental problems of the\r\ntheory of random matrices and  random polynomials and their\r\napplications, and on related problems in  statistical physics. The\r\ncornerstone of the problems  is different conjectures of universality,\r\nwhich state  that as the size of a random matrix (or the degree of a\r\nrandom polynomial) approaches infinity, the correlations between\r\nproperly scaled eigenvalues (or zeros) approach a universal limit.  In\r\nthe current project the PI continues his studies of the universality\r\nin random matrix  models, random polynomials, and statistical\r\nphysics. This includes: (i) The Riemann-Hilbert (RH) approach to\r\ndouble scaling limits in random matrix models. (ii) RH approach to\r\nrandom matrices with external source.  (iii) Semiclassical asymptotics\r\nand RH approach to multi-matrix models. (iv) RH approach to the\r\nsix-vertex model of statistical physics. (v) Scaling limits and\r\nuniversality in non-Gaussian ensembles of random polynomials and\r\nrandom algebraic varieties.\r\n\r\nThe project has an interdisciplinary character and it lies on the\r\nfrontier between physics and mathematics. The problems of scaling and\r\nuniversality are central in many areas of modern science: theory of\r\ncritical phenomena and phase transitions, statistical physics and\r\nquantum field theory, theory of quantum chaos, nonlinear dynamics,\r\netc. This project is directed on development of powerful mathematical\r\nmethods to the problems of scaling and universality in the  theory of\r\nrandom matrices, random polynomials, and related topics. It  involves\r\ndifferent areas of mathematics: analysis, theory of integrable\r\nsystems,  probability theory, semiclassical asymptotics for systems of\r\ndifferential equations, complex analysis, etc. The research project\r\nunder consideration has  direct applications to various physical\r\nproblems: combinatorial asymptotics related to quantum gravity,\r\nexactly solvable models of statistical physics, spin systems on random\r\nsurfaces, theory of critical phenomena and phase transitions, quantum\r\nchaos. Possible further applications include  theory of knots and\r\nlinks and related problems in molecular biology,  growth models,\r\nstatistical data analysis, and others.\r\n",
