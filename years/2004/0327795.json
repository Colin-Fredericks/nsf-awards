The program will showcase seven distinguished scholars from a broad range of mathematical subject areas:\r\n\r\nRobert Bryant       Duke University               geometry  \r\nR. R. Coifman       Yale University               wavelets, applied mathematics \r\nJohn P. D'Angelo    University of Illinois        geometric analysis\r\nJoseph J. Kohn      Princeton University          partial differential equations\r\nBlaine Lawson       SUNY at Stony Brook           geometry \r\nYves Meyer          Universite de Paris           harmonic analysis \r\nRichard Schoen      Stanford University           geometry \r\nElias M. Stein      Princeton University          harmonic analysis \r\n\r\nOur conference will feature both lectures for the public and specialized seminars for mathematicians.  \r\n\r\nWe see our activity as having two vectors:  (1)  to inform the public about progress in the mathematical sciences and (2) to stimulate mathematical activity in the mathematics departments at Washington University and nearby universities. Our conference will not concentrate on achievements of the past 150 years.  It will look forward to prospects for the future.\r\n\r\nA number of Washington University graduate and undergraduate alumni as well as former postdocs have agreed to attend the event.  We will make special efforts to include mathematicians from the greater St.Louis area and across the country in our conference.  We are using direct mail, e-mail, and personal contacts to make the mathematical community aware of our event.  A significant portion of our funding will be dedicated to subventing the travel expenses of women, young people, graduate students, and under-represented groups.",
