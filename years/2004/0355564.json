 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for award DMS-0355564 of Duke\r\n\r\nDuke and his students will work on two broad sets of problems:\r\nto develop the analytic theory of division fields of elliptic curves and abelian varieties\r\nand to understand the number-theoretic significance of special values\r\nof spectral L-functions and their derivatives.\r\nThe first part may be described as ``nonabelian\" analytic number\r\ntheory and is motivated by applications to the mod p reductions\r\nof elliptic curves and abelian varieties. So far progress has been\r\npossible assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), and\r\nits removal it one of the many challenges.\r\nThe second part is motivated by some analogies Duke has observed\r\nbetween the generation of number fields by units occurring as\r\nspecial values of derivatives of L-functions (e.g. the ``Stark\r\nconjectures\") and the special values of derivatives of L\r\nfunctions associated to Riemann surfaces. \r\n \r\nA general goal of the proposal is to extend the reach of analytic number theory,\r\nboth within number theory at large and also within mathematics\r\nmore generally. It has become evident over the last\r\nfew years that the techniques of analytic number theory have a\r\nmuch broader applicability than was earlier appreciated.\r\nSuch techniques also have potential importance in practical applications,\r\nespecially in cryptography and related areas.\r\n",
