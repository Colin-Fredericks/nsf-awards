However, with increasing frequency the samples that need analysis with diffraction are small.  Camera techniques, which have been a mainstay, are time consuming, require significant conversion to obtain digital data, and are becoming obsolete.  Moreover, they and other traditional methods cannot perform in situ powder diffraction from microscopic areas on surfaces of diverse objects.  Recently, the development of laboratory diffraction instruments combining a finely collimated point X-ray beam, sample holders with automated motion, and large two dimensional detectors permit solving the sample, film and time problems.  This project involves acquiring such a new microdiffraction system for use by scientists and conservators at the American Museum of Natural History, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory/Columbia University and the Metropolitan Museum of Art and other potential users in the region.  Numerous projects by more than ten investigators are planned initially for the new microdiffraction instrument, ranging from fundamental mineralogical and materials research to detailed conservation studies of artifacts and art from the collaborating museums.  Routinely the microdiffraction system will be used to identify samples from the mineral, rock and meteorite collections to improve their characterization and value to the scientific community and general public.  The broader impacts of this study include the interaction and collaboration of researchers at a major university and two research museums, involvement and training of students, interns and visiting scholars, enhanced understanding of objects of all kinds including specimens, artifacts, and art objects in two world-class museums, and advancement of conservation science and techniques for the preservation of art and natural history objects for posterity.\r\n***\r\n",
