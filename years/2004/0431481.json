They plan to study innovative technology for improving wear resistance and fracture toughness of austempered ductile iron (ADI) used for automotive industry by either thermomechanical or two-step austempering processes. The automotive industry is continuously investigating means for producing long lasting and cheaper parts to stay competitive in the market place.  ADI is used for manufacturing crankshafts, camshafts and gears.  Because of its high strength, good ductility, good wear resistance and fracture toughness, it is considered an attractive substitute for wrought or forged steel parts. This work is aimed to further improve the mechanical properties of the conventional ADI by applying either thermomechanical process for producing ausformed-austempered ductile iron (AADI) or using a novel two-step austempering process. The PIs will investigate both unalloyed as well as alloyed ADI with different amounts of Ni, Mo and Cu. The relationship between fracture toughness, reduction ratio in height during the thermomechanical processing and the microstructural variables such as amount of retained austenite, austenite carbon content, type of formed bainitic structure and matrix hardness will be determined. At the same time, the prediction equations of fracture toughness and wear resistance of those ADIs will be also determined using the finite element method.\r\n\r\nScope and broader impacts: The project will provide a better understanding of the wear resistance, static and dynamic behaviors of those ADIs under investigation so we can design and produce long-lasting automotive parts while reducing costs.  The automotive industry is growing also in Egypt, so adopting such technology will produce affordable cars.  Automotive industry will be contacted and informed for possible participation and contribution toward the implementation of this phase of the project.  The collaborative arrangement between scientists at TTU and CMRDI will promote research as well as educational ties between the two institutions, with an exchange of expertise and knowledge between people at both institutions.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the project at the two partnering institutions, and the findings will be incorporated in their relevant courses. Furthermore, the results of this study will be disseminated to the engineering community through publication in refereed journals and professional conferences. This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.\r\n",
