 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses certain basic aspects of the electroweak and\r\nstrong interactions reflected in the properties of mesons and nucleons\r\n(particles found inside atomic nuclei) and their interactions at low\r\nenergies.  The strong and weak interactions are responsible for the\r\nstructure of matter at the smallest known scale, a femtometer or less. \r\nThe research is motivated by the fact that the present comprehensive\r\ntheory--the Standard Model (SM)--is known to be incomplete. \r\nFurthermore, the SM becomes unworkable for strong interactions at low\r\nenergies.\r\n\r\nThe rare beta decay of the pi-meson (pion), occurring once in about 100\r\nmillion ordinary pion decays, provides a theoretically clean window to\r\ncertain possible extensions of the SM.  The PIBETA\r\nexperiment, mounted at the Paul Scherrer Institute, Switzerland, by an\r\ninternational collaboration of seven institutions led by the University\r\nof Virginia (UVa) group, has already improved the accuracy of the pion\r\nbeta decay rate five-fold, from 4% to 0.8% in a series of measurements\r\nfrom 1999 through 2001.  Further improvement in precision, down to about\r\n0.5%, is forthcoming in the next year or two through improved data\r\nanalysis.  All other rare decay channels of the pion and the muon have\r\nbeen similarly improved in precision.  An important anomaly was\r\ndiscovered in our pion radiative decay data, prompting a new, dedicated\r\nmeasurement of this decay in 2004.  After that, we plan to design a new\r\nprecise measurement of the Pi -> e nu decay, a process of profound\r\nsignificance in determining whether or not nature treats the familiar\r\nelectron and its more massive cousin, the muon, in precisely the same\r\nway.  Even a small departure would signal new physics.\r\n\r\nDuring the past five years this program has resulted in two doctoral\r\ndegrees at UVa plus three more at collaborating universities stemming\r\nfrom the PIBETA project alone.  Four more UVa Ph.D. degrees are expected\r\nin the next two years.  Each year typically one to two undergraduate\r\nstudents are engaged in research on this project, thus gaining practical\r\nlaboratory experience.\r\n",
