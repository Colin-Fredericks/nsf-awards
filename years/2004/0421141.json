 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests funds to acquire a 4-circle x-ray diffractometer for structural analysis of thin films, single crystals and powder samples. This instrument  will be a key component of research projects in several multidisciplinary areas such as Materials Physics, Condensed Matter Physics, Nanotechnology, Geosciences and  Chemistry. The materials physics projects include structural characterization of epitaxial thin films of functional metal oxides grown by pulsed laser deposition. The thin films which will be studied include colossal magnetoresistive manganite materials for infrared detector and magnetic sensor applications and charge-ordered manganites for photonic device applications.  Besides  using the diffractometer as a diagnostics tool for establishing phase purity and crystalline quality of epitaxial thin films,  detailed evaluation of lattice parameters will be undertaken to study lattice-mismatch strain effects in several material systems. Structural analysis using the x-ray diffractometer will also form an essential component in our lattice engineering efforts to grow functional oxide materials on technologically important substrates such as Silicon, employing buffer and template layer schemes.  The nanotechnology projects which will use this instrument include study of mechanical properties of thin films using atomic force microscopy and x-ray micro beam techniques and growth of macromolecular crystals. The x-ray diffractometer will also form a vital component in several geology research projects.   The use of this instrument will have a major impact on the characterization of the mineralogy of fine-grained sediments in the investigation of the evolution dynamics of geological systems. Another geology project which requires x-ray diffraction analysis is the evaluation of organic shales as potential sources of oil and natural gas by  estimating the peak burial temperatures of petroleum source rocks using the illite crystallinity index method. In addition to the above mentioned  projects in physics and geosciences, the x-ray diffractometer will also contribute to several research projects in  the Chemistry  department including Forensic Chemistry, nano surface processes, self assembly of mono-layers on template surfaces, solid state phase transformations  catalytic surface chemistry and materials chemistry.   The x-ray diffractometer will also  be used to enhance undergraduate education through laboratory instruction as well as through undergraduate research projects. X-ray diffraction experiments will be implemented in advanced physics laboratory courses and upper level geology courses. Besides Towson University, several other institutions in the vicinity are expected to benefit from this instrument via collaborative research.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests funds to acquire an  x-ray diffractometer for  analyzing the structural properties of materials in the form of thin films, powders and single crystals. This instrument will be a key component of research projects in several multidisciplinary areas such as Materials Physics, Condensed Matter Physics, Nanotechnology, Geosciences and  Chemistry at Towson University. The materials physics projects focus on the development of novel materials for  technological applications such as electronic sensors for sensing temperature and magnetic field and  nano-structured photonic materials for optical communications and computing.  The development of these novel materials involve  studies of their crystal structure by x-ray diffraction using the proposed instrument. The x-ray diffractometer will also form a vital component in several geology research projects.  The projects include characterization of trace elements in fine-grained sediments to study the evolution and dynamics of geological systems  and evaluating the potential of organic-rich shales as source rocks for oil and natural gas by estimating the peak burial temperatures of petroleum source rocks. The x-ray diffractometer will also contribute to several research projects in the Chemistry  department including Forensic Chemistry.
