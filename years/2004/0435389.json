There is a strong motivation to thoroughly understand the interference phenomenon and adaptively adjust a wireless network to mitigate its effect.  The research objective is to codify the emission from several devices that produce electromagnetic interference in the 2.4 GHz (and potentially 5 GHz) unlicensed band.\r\nA three-prong methodology is employed:  (1) development of a theoretical model of the interfering signal in the temporal and spectral domains; (2) the validation of the interference model via computer simulation; (3) physical experimentation to verify and enhance the accuracy of the previous results, which in turn augment the experimental work.\r\nFor the devices considered, the interference temperature is determined as an outcome.  The aggregate effect on wireless network throughput is measured and related to the interference temperature.  These results suggest that techniques can be developed to improve network connectivity.  Temporal, spatial, and spectral scales can be advantageously used in adaptive algorithms to flatten interference and assist in the development of underlay networks, such as ultrawideband.\r\nThis research will have broad impact and allow the technical community to better understand how to use the available network resources.  Network performance improvement can result in significant cost saving to the wireless industry.  An important impact will be on U.S. government communication policy.  The education and training of graduate and undergraduate students will be enhanced by this research.  The results will be disseminated via public demonstrations, symposia, seminars, and publications.\r\n",
