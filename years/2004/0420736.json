 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to establish a state-of-the-art research and training facility at Montana State University devoted toward the study of microwave and millimeter wave devices, circuits, systems and phenomena. The requested equipment, a 110 GHz vector network analyzer (VNA), will form The cornerstone of the microwave/millimeter wave lab at MSU, complementing the lab's outstanding array of simulation tools currently being used for such research. The VNA is the key piece of test equipment for such work, allowing researchers to determine the vector reflection and transmission behavior of devices, circuits and systems. As reflection and transmission characteristics are of fundamental importance in high-frequency design, the VNA is an indispensable tool for microwave/millimeter wave experimentalists. \r\n\r\nA variety of research and training activities in the area of microwave and millimeter wave electronics is currently being conducted in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department at MSU. For example, novel power combining architectures suitable for millimeter wave source development are being investigated through microwave modeling. The equipment sought through this proposal will allow researchers to demonstrate micromachined versions of such structures in their intended frequency range (75 GHz and above). In other present efforts, planar antenna technology is being studied for use in ad hoc networks and in environmental sensing applications, and low-cost frequency scalable micromachined receivers are being considered for applications at millimeter and submillimeter-wave frequencies. The requested equipment will be used extensively in these activities and will foster the development of interdisciplinary efforts between the microwave/millimeter wave group and research groups devoted toward biofilm engineering, material development, and spatial-spectral holography for example.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit of the proposed activities: The PI has many years of experience in the design and analysis of planar microwave/millimeter wave circuitry, and has established the necessary simulation and modeling infrastructure to take full advantage of the requested equipment. Combined with a precision probe station to be acquired through a recent grant, and frequency extension modules sought through the M.J. Murdock Charitable Trust, the requested VNA will establish a state-of-the art test bed for on-wafer characterization to true submillimeter wave frequencies. The activities that will be made possible through acquisition of the VNA will contribute to the understanding of microwave and millimeter wave phenomenon and to the development of devices, circuits and systems operating in this increasingly important frequency range. Current projects include creative efforts aimed at: (1) developing low-cost power sources, the lack of which is widely regarded as the primary impediment to further development of the higher millimeter wave range, (2) demonstrating the potential of low-cost micromachined receiver circuits, (3) exploiting planar circuitry and novel materials for environmental sensing in applications that cross various fields and (4) developing high-resolution radar using spatial spectral holography.\r\n\r\nBroader impact of the proposed activities: The requested equipment will significantly enhance the research and training activities at MSU by providing participants the ability to properly characterize devices and circuits at millimeter wave frequencies. To the PI's knowledge, such facilities do not presently exist in the state of Montana or in neighboring states. To maximize the impact of the proposed activities within the region, the facilities will be advertised and open to external users. The requested equipment will provide the necessary resources to inspire and support multidisciplinary collaborations between research groups including those whose primary emphasis is far afield from microwave/millimeter wave engineering. For example, MSU currently enjoys vibrant research programs in biofilms, nanomaterial development and spatial-spectral holography. Creative interaction between such groups and the microwave/millimeter wave group will emerge to make notable contributions to the fields of microsensors, metamaterials, and high-resolution radar. Establishment of the proposed facility will aid in the recruitment and retention of faculty and graduate students. To this point, the ECE department is recruiting two additional faculty members in 2004. As candidates with background in telecommunications and VLSI design are sought, there is a high probability that the number of personnel using the requested equipment will grow. Finally, by enabling the testing of microfabricated millimeter wave circuitry, the requested equipment will allow the microwave/millimeter wave group to support the microfabrication facilities at MSU. The microfabrication lab is undergoing a major upgrade thanks in part to a recent two million dollar grant awarded to MSU researchers for this purpose.\r\n\r\n",
