 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for renovations of an existing building to expand laboratory space available for staff and for visiting students and researchers at the Archbold Biological Station.  The renovation will convert existing attic space in the Station's main building into 6,000 sq. feet of space devoted to new open-plan laboratories, storage space, small offices and informal meeting areas.  The renovation will also increase access to the computer network, and improve building infrastructure with new insulation and upgraded air handling. \r\n\r\nResearch activities at Archbold focus on a distinctive natural ecosystem, the Florida scrub, that has dry, sandy conditions and that is subject to frequent natural fires. Studies range from genetics of rare species to landscape-scale analysis of the effects of fire on species distribution and on ecosystem processes.  In addition to its research programs, the Archbold Station has active programs aimed at informal science education, including a nature trail, guided tours of the Station conducted by  volunteer docents, and public seminars.  \r\n",
