 "awd_abstract_narration": "Analysis and Modeling of Diffuse Ultrasonic Signals\r\nfor Structural Health Monitoring\r\nThe use of permanently mounted sensors to monitor the health of critical structures such as airplanes,\r\nbridges and buildings is quickly becoming a reality as sensors for measuring such physical quantities as\r\ntemperature, moisture and strain become smaller and more robust. However, these devices are limited\r\nto point, or local, measurements and thus do not truly interrogate the volumetric state of the structure.\r\nSparse arrays of permanently mounted ultrasonic sensors, acting as both sources and receivers, can send\r\nultrasonic energy throughout the entire structural volume and thus have the potential to detect critical\r\nchanges. Before this goal can become a reality, revolutionary advances must be made in the analysis\r\nand processing of the received ultrasonic signals so that structural changes that may lead to catastrophic\r\nfailure can be reliably detected with an acceptably low false alarm rate. A significant complication is\r\nthat benign environmental effects such as changes in temperature and surface conditions can cause\r\nlarger changes in the ultrasonic signals than actual flaws.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The research proposed here is a combination of experiments and waveform\r\nmodeling, and considers the development and verification of signal processing, classification and data\r\nfusion methods based upon quantitative changes in the ultrasonic signals. The testing mode considered\r\nis that of diffuse ultrasonic waves whereby a point-like impulsive excitation is used to generate multi-modal\r\nelastic waves that fill the structure with sound. Ultrasonic diffuse wave theory models the rate\r\nof energy decay but does not predict the details of the complex time domain signals. The proposed\r\nresearch will combine time-dependent analysis of coherence with feature extraction, classification\r\nmethods, signal modeling and simulation, and data fusion to tackle the challenging problem of detecting\r\nand characterizing damage. One inherent problem in using classification methods such as neural\r\nnetworks for this application is the need to have a large set of signals from a wide variety of flaws; this\r\nis not practical for structures outside the laboratory. A key aspect of the proposed research is to\r\ndevelop methods for perturbing the baseline signal from the undamaged structure in order to emulate a\r\nwide variety of structural and environmental changes.\r\nFour tasks are defined as follows:\r\n1. Signal Processing and Classification Methods. Development of quantitative differential methods to\r\ndetermine if signal changes are due to structural or environmental effects, and to characterize\r\nstructural changes as to location, severity, type, etc.\r\n2. Modeling and Simulation of Diffuse Ultrasonic Signals. Modeling of diffuse ultrasonic signals, and\r\nsimulation of environmental and structural changes.\r\n3. Transducer Placement and Data Fusion. Analysis of optimum transducer organization and\r\nplacement, and fusing of data from multiple transducers.\r\n4. Design and Implementation of Experimental Measurements. Ultrasonic diffuse wave\r\nmeasurements using metallic, composite and cement-based structures.\r\nBroader Impact: This multidisciplinary research program will lead to effective use of ultrasonic\r\nsensors for continuously monitoring the health of critical structures, which will enable appropriate\r\naction to take place prior to catastrophic failure. Furthermore, the methodologies developed will have\r\nbroad application to other disciplines such as sonar, radar and biomedical signal processing. A key part\r\nof the educational impact is the participation of undergraduates as well as graduate students, and a\r\nconcerted effort will be made to recruit women and underrepresented minorities. Also proposed is the\r\ndevelopment of a graduate course in ultrasonic wave propagation and signal processing that will\r\ncombine the fundamentals of acoustic and elastic wave propagation with signal processing methods as\r\napplied to ultrasonics. This research program will also complement other efforts at Georgia Tech,\r\neffectively creating a critical mass of research in ultrasonics for structural health monitoring.",
