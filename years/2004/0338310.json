Klemm; Vincent Cassone; Rajesh Miranda; James Lindner\r\nPartner School Districts: Bryan, College Station, Hearne, Iola, Mumford, Navasota, North Zulch, Snook, and Somerville, plus 75 other rural schools in a distant learning community\r\nFunding: $1,500,000 (total for 3 years)\r\nNumber of Fellows/year: 12 graduate and 5 advanced undergraduate\r\nTarget Audience: Middle school (grades 6-8)\r\nSetting: Rural\r\nNSF Supported Disciplines Involved: Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics\r\n\r\nNarrative:  This project is designed to: 1) develop and implement a mechanism to enrich graduate education; 2) enhance knowledge and skills of Fellows for educational outreach; 3) heighten Fellows appreciation of the needs and opportunities of rural, geographically-isolated students; and 4)  improve teachers' knowledge and understanding in STEM.  After an orientation workshop Fellows, in partnership with teachers, serve as role models and stimulate students' interest in STEM by conveying the excitement of research and discovery both in local rural schools and, through distance education web-based resources and regional professional development workshops, in more distant schools.  Basically, university faculty and Fellows in combination with middle school teachers are developing and implementing day to day classroom activities in STEM using materials, such as the Peer Integrative Curriculum (http://peer.tamu.edu), already developed by existing federally-funded outreach projects\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Fellows in specific STEM disciplines are: improving their communication and teaching skills, enhancing their interest in K-12 education, and gaining an increased appreciation of the collaborative opportunities that exist between public and higher education. Teachers are gaining STEM knowledge and skills through professional development workshops and their work with the Fellows. In addition a set of teachers who are normally somewhat isolated from university resources due to their rural setting are discovering the mechanisms available to access university STEM faculty and programs.  Middle grade rural public school students are experiencing enriched experiential learning in STEM through the curriculum resources and engaging activities introduced. \r\n\r\nBroader impacts:  Rural schools, because of their isolation, are traditionally underserved by university outreach programs.  In addition the schools targeted have a high percentage of under-represented minorities.  A detailed study of project outcomes coupled with broad dissemination through presentation at meetings and a web site will inform others of the potential for this project as a model for others. \r\n\r\nThis project is partially supported by funds from the Directorate for Biological Sciences.\r\n",
