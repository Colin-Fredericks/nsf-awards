 "awd_abstract_narration": "SSI: Lebesgue Estimation for Minimizing Power Consumption in Ad Hoc Sensor Networks (Proposal No. 0427976)\r\n\r\nAbstract- This sensor proposal focuses on the development a new type of state-estimator (optimal observer) that minimizes the power requirements of wireless sensor networks employed in real-time feedback control systems. There is considerable ongoing work in optimizing sensor network protocols for minimizing power requirements. It is noted that most of the power consumed in a wireless sensor device is associated with executing a communication transmission event. This research seeks to determine a method whereby both the occurrence of communication events is minimized and the data content of each message is minimized while ensuring that the resulting state estimate does not exceed a specified error requirement. The intellectual merit of this research is in transforming a continuous-time and continuous-state model for the plant into a non-periodic discrete-time and non-uniform discrete-state system. The research will develop methods for analyzing and designing state estimators as stochastic timed automata within the framework of generalized semi-Markov processes. The broader impact of this research is setting the foundation for a wireless sensor network laboratory at the University of Arkansas. This laboratory is directed towards intelligent transportation systems in anticipation of the introduction of ad hoc sensor networks throughout highway infrastructure and motor vehicles. In outreach to K-12 students, the laboratory elevates the awareness of engineering careers to young people by showing explicitly how technology can be employed to increase safety, reduce congestion, and improve air quality. Additionally, the results will aid in the development of advanced collision avoidance and traffic regulation systems.   \r\n\r\n",
