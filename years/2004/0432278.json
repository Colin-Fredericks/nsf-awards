 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chapman Conferences are topical meetings sponsored by the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and are designed to promote opportunities not normally available through the format of larger meetings. In this proposal, funds are requested from the National Science Foundation for travel expenses of some graduate students, young scientists, invited speakers, and others who need support to participate in the Chapman Conference on Solar Energetic Plasmas and Particles, to be held in Turku, Finland during the period August 2-6, 2004. \r\n\r\nSince the discovery of solar energetic particles (SEPs) nearly six decades ago, tremendous progress has been made in understanding them in recent years, thanks to the vast array of space and ground based instruments observing SEPs (and related solar and interplanetary disturbances, such as shocks, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and eruptive flares). The solar, interplanetary, and heliospheric communities have been able to synthesize imaging and time-series data to obtain a detailed picture of the origin, composition, and propagation of SEPs, as well as their geospace impact. Because of their impact on global space-based and ground-based technologies, SEPs have assumed new importance among the international Space Weather and Living With A Star (LWS) communities, which are actively studying them.\r\n\r\nThis Chapman conference will help synergize and coordinate international efforts in SEP-related research and observations, and thus further the scientific goals of the NSF's National Space Weather Program and Solar Terrestrial Research Program.",
