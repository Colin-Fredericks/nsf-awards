Keith Ashman and Stephen Zepf will study the formation and evolution of globular cluster systems and their host galaxies through ground based observational studies and semi-analytical theoretical models.  The program will focus on two areas of research.  The first of these is to improve the determination of the total number, color, and spatial distribution of globular clusters through wide-field imaging and to develop theoretical tools to constrain the sites of metal-poor globular cluster formation from these data.  The second area is a combined observational and theoretical study of the ages and metallicities of globular cluster populations through the use of optical to near-IR colors, optical spectroscopy and the development of semi-analytical models of galaxy and cluster formation.   The program will promote teaching, training, and learning by including students at all levels into the research program, by incorporating research into introductory courses and through involvement in outreach programs for the public.\r\n\r\n",
