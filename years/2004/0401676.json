 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the continuation of the annual West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) project workshops. The WAIS project has successfully focused a broad cross-section of the Antarctic research community on two urgent global issues: future sea level and rapid climate change. WAIS is multidisciplinary and the support will help to foster continued cross-disciplinary interaction. WAIS workshops began in 1990; first to formulate the objectives of WAIS and, beginning in 1992, to exchange and present scientific findings in a forum where cross-disciplinary scientific discourse was promoted and progress toward WAIS goals could be annually assessed. These workshops have been the backbone of this cooperative scientific effort. The WAIS community has voiced its support for continuing these workshops on an annual basis. Funds are provided to support future WAIS workshops in three ways: first, to assist in the notification, organization and execution of annual workshops for the next three years; second, to further enhance these workshops by offering travel stipends to attract new participants deemed by the WAIS Working Group to be key persons in further enhancing the WAIS program; and third, to maintain a web site for workshop organization and to serve as a clearinghouse for information relevant to the WAIS research community.\r\n\r\n",
