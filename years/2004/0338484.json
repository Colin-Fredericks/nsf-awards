 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing hands-on experiments and explanatory material that train students in analyzing multiple length and time scales in transport phenomena based on ideas of transport and hydrodynamic instabilities. The experiments mostly comprise of simple tabletop demonstrations and have both flexibility and variability. The material is being made available in a WEBCT format and explains experimental phenomena using picture arguments, scaling arguments and mathematical analysis and is fortified with animations and applications to engineering, everyday experience and natural phenomena. Each experiment and accompanying material is a stand-alone and can be exported in modules or in groups of modules to classes in heat, mass and momentum transport. These experiments and video clips are being constructed so that they are of use to curricula in chemical, mechanical, materials, and biomedical engineering, and engineering physics.\r\n\r\nThe beneficiaries of the proposed prototype are undergraduate students and faculty alike. The experiments are particularly helpful for the visual intuitive student whose appreciation does not lie in the mathematical model, rather in the art form and in the physics underlying the phenomena. Yet, they also benefits the analytical deductive student and stir up creativity in both types of students. The professor gains because the hands-on experiments are expected to liven up the lectures and sustain the interest of the student. The prototypes are being be tested in a classroom setting and evaluations are being conducted both during the formative and execution phases of the project.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposal: The proposed activity is based on over twenty years of research experience of the PI. The students are learning to think creatively and view transport phenomena as more than a mathematical subject to be tolerated. The intellectual merit lies in the fact that the affected audience actually learns to become intellectuals instead of number-crunching technicians.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of the Proposal: The proposed study encourages the participation of undergraduate students and graduate students in the development of the educational materials. As a result, students are being encouraged to participate in the education process and consider teaching and research as a career. \r\n\r\nIn this Proof of Concept phase, the results of the project are being tried at the University of Florida. The PI is also sending materials to the University of Idaho where one of their faculty members is trying the materials in a course on fluid flow and transport. Both universities have substantial numbers of women and minority students. Dissemination is via the electronic media and major conferences.\r\n",
