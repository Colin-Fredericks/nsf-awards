 "awd_abstract_narration": "The High Pressure Gordon Conference has been held biannually for 49 years: it\r\ncontinues to be vital to new science developments in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry,\r\nearth/planetary science, materials and biology. It is one of the few that crosscuts a broad\r\nspectrum of topics with a unifying theme of condensing matter with pressure. Spectacular\r\nadvances are now being made in high-pressure methods for creating new materials, and for\r\nstudying physical, chemical and biological processes under high-pressure conditions: recent\r\nbreakthroughs include diffraction of light elements using neutron scattering at extreme\r\nconditions, direct measurement of thermal conductivity, acoustic velocities, and even the full\r\ndensity of states at extreme conditions, polymerisation of molecules into new solids, creation\r\nof super-hard materials, increasing superconducting Tc to record values, formation of\r\nunexpected incommensurate structures in metals; and advances in fundamental theoretical\r\ndescriptions of simple molecular systems. Emerging areas include high-pressure\r\ncrystallography of hydrogen containing materials, new techniques for synchrotron/neutron\r\nstudies and ongoing development of inelastic x-ray scattering on small volumes, and\r\nunderstanding mineral physics of outer planets and stars. The 2004 GRC will feature invited\r\ntalks in exciting new areas at the forefront of science, including shock wave techniques of\r\ndouble shock, laser shock, and shock-spectroscopy experiments; high pressure melting and\r\nliquid structure;, super high pressure acoustic velocity measurement on metals and minerals;\r\nsampling the deep Earth with single crystal x-ray studies at record pressures; new synchrotron\r\nand neutron experiments; high-pressure superconductivity, and new metallic behaviour at\r\nhigh pressure. For a vibrant and successful conference, it is essential to represent all sectors\r\nof the field, including graduate students, post-docs and junior faculty, as well as newcomers\r\nto the high-pressure field. Diversity is also stressed, including representatives from many\r\ncountries as well as more female scientists than in past conferences. Financing participation\r\nin such a conference is an impediment to attendance by many attendees, that can not be\r\ncovered by the existing GRC fund. Here we request supplementary funds to subsidize travel\r\nand conference fees, to enable participation by students and junior scientists, as well as\r\n\"newcomers\" to the high-pressure field, with great benefits for US and international science.\r\nFunds are being requested from two different NSF programs in approximately equal amounts\r\nsince these two areas are heavily represented in the program.\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThis conference has traditionally had few women and minorities, often less than 3%.\r\nThis conference there are 3 women speakers, greater than 10% as well as a woman discussion\r\nleader and woman chair (this conference's first). There are two Hispanic speakers, but not\r\nAmerican Hispanic. It is expected that this conference will have a larger than average\r\nnumber of women scientists, a very underrepresented group in physics, and physical sciences.\r\nTraditionally Gordon Conferences are platforms where one may bring in speculative\r\nideas to generate discussion, hence no photographs or publishable results. However, it is here\r\nwhere inspiration to new directions and collaborations lead to new publications. The Gordon\r\nConference on Research at High Pressure is only one of two conferences where these\r\nscientists meet, the other being the biannual AIRAPT, held only in odd numbered years.\r\nThis conference is extremely important for students and postdocs to attend (6 of the\r\nspeakers are students or postdoctoral scholars, an even larger number are invited posters) as it\r\nis an integral part of their education to meet the key people in the field of high pressure,\r\ndiscuss their work and putting their own ideas under the scrutiny of experts, and to be\r\ninspired in new directions. This is what will help generate effective new scientists.",
