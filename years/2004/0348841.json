 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Academy of Sciences, through their Committee on Science Education, will oversee a research synthesis on children's science learning in grades K-8.  The proposal makes the case that there has not yet been a study of this kind that pulls together research from multiple disciplines (science content, learning theory in the cognitive sciences, developmental psychology, social psychology and anthropology) and incorporates research from the standards movement along with the impact of accountability at all levels of the education system.  The study proposes to address the following questions:\r\n1.\tWhat does a comprehensive picture of how children acquire scientific ideas look like?\r\n2.\tHow can this comprehensive understanding be helpful to advancing goals around student achievement and equity in opportunities to learn science?  How can this knowledge help advance the design of science assessments?\r\n3.\tWhat other lines of research need to be pursued to make our understanding about how students learn science more complete?\r\n\r\nAn NRC study committee that reflects a multidisciplinary perspective and includes expertise in science and science education, cognitive psychology, child development, learning theory, education policy and education research will carry out the study.  The work will be conducted through commissioned papers and workshops.  \r\n\r\nThe work will be analyzed and synthesized into an NRC report.  The NRC is working with the Merck Institute for Science Education about providing a shorter, more policy-oriented document to accompany the full-length report.  It is anticipated the report will be of interest to educators, researchers and policymakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
