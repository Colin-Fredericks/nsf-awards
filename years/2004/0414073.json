 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to detect and respond to chemical stimuli is a fundamental behavior of all organisms.  Lepidoptera male moths have an exquisitely sensitive olfactory system that is capable of perceiving airborne pheromone molecules released by females and responding to them over great distances.  They are capable of distinguishing between closely related pheromones of different species.  Pheromone binding proteins play an important role in olfaction. They are carrier proteins that transport the volatile hydrophobic pheromone molecules across the aqueous lymph to the membrane-bound olfactory receptors.  Interaction of pheromone and pheromone binding protein is the first step in the sequential events that leads to the activation of the receptor. Despite over 50 % sequence identity pheromone binding proteins from different moth species have different substrate specificity.  The overall goal of this project is to understand the role of pheromone binding protein in the process of recognition.  This project utilizes biochemistry, molecular biology, and structural biology to test the hypothesis that pheromone specificity is encoded in the pheromone binding proteins.  Knowledge gained from these studies may have significance to insect control, through pheromone based integrated pest management programs to control agricultural pests and also those who are carrier of vector borne diseases. This project will contribute to Stony Brook University through \"Women in Science and Engineering program provide training opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students, particularly for women and under-represented groups.",
