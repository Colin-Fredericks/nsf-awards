 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to investigate a new, high performance scintillation detector for eventual use in nuclear borehole logging. Nuclear borehole logging is an important technique for both geophysical research and commercial oil exploration. Well logging can be used to perform remote characterization of subsurface geological properties such as formation density, shale identification, and chemical composition. Well logging is performed by inserting a tool incorporating a gamma ray detector into a borehole drilled through the formation. Important requirements for the x-ray detectors used in well logging application include high detection efficiency, good energy resolution, high count-rate capability, and ruggedness. In addition, the detector must be capable of operation at high temperatures encountered in the borehole.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project is unique because it will provide better tools for geophysical research and lead to better understanding of a promising scintillator that can be applied to numerous fields beyond well logging.  Teaching, training and learning can be gained by using this scintillator in various settings such as physics experimentation and from the materials science issues that are required to optimize its performance.  Agreements with numerous educational institutions will be utilized to facilitate a teaching, and training. These sensors should offer high performance at low cost, which could enable research activities at educational institutions. Useful insights can be gained in particle physics, radiochemistry, and elemental analysis experiments.",
