In-plane imprint sites are formed in floating monolayers of polymerizable alkyl-silanes co-spread with functionalized \"target\" silanes and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) bearing lipids. The lateral diffusivity of monolayer components facilitates a matching of amphiphile functional groups with residues on the adsorbing proteins through complementary interactions (hydrogen bonding, electrostatic), preserved upon monolayer polymerization. The Langmuir monolayer technique allows functional group density, lateral mobility, polymerization rate, gelled film morphology, PEG conformation, and protein insertion to be precisely controlled. Contraction of the imprinted monolayer upon alkyl-silane hydrolysis and condensation accompanied by barrier compression adds a \"molecular vise\" aspect to imprinting, where PEG chains that initially explore a large area in the \"mushroom\" phase are forced into the more ordered and conformationally restricted \"brush\" phase. This induced assembly of PEG bearing amphiphiles around proteins adsorbed to target silane head-groups builds binding pockets, while weakly adsorbed proteins (poor imprints) are squeezed out, improving binding site affinity and homogeneity. The PEG brush layer surrounding the in-plane imprints also reduces non-imprint mediated protein re-binding. The proposed collaborative research will help establish a nanoscience based partnership between the Biological Engineering department at Utah State University and the Bioengineering and Metallurgical Engineering departments at the University of Utah, leading to infrastructure enhancement and cooperative graduate and undergraduate student involvement from both universities\r\n",
