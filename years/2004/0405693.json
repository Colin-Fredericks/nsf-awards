 "awd_abstract_narration": "McClure proposes to build on prior work with Jeff Smith which allows several\r\nimportant operads and their actions to be investigated combinatorially\r\n(specifically, cosimplicially).  One direction, which is already partially\r\ncompleted, is to relate our work to that of Chas and Sullivan.  Expected\r\nresults in this direction are: the Chas-Sullivan operations are induced by a\r\nchain-level action of the framed little 2-disks operad (this is an analogue of\r\nDeligne's Hochschild cohomology conjecture) and the Eilenberg-Moore spectral\r\nsequence converging to the homology of the free loop space of a compact\r\noriented PL manifold is a spectral sequence of Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras.\r\nAnother problem which may be accessible by these methods is Kontsevich's \r\n``higher Deligne conjecture.''  A longer-term goal is to combine Mandell's \r\ntheorem that E-infinity chain algebras model topological spaces with our \r\ncombinatorial E-infinity chain operads to obtain explicit results.\r\n\r\nAn interesting development in theoretical physics during the last twenty years\r\nhas been the increasing significance of homotopy theory.  It seems to be\r\nuseful to create chain-complex models for quantum field theories, both as a \r\npreliminary step toward the full development of such theories and as a \r\npermanent computational device.  Operads have played an important role as an\r\norganizational tool for this kind of work.  Recently Chas and Sullivan have\r\nshown that the unbased loop space of any compact oriented PL manifold is a\r\nquantum field theory at the level of homology; this raises the question of\r\nwhether their work can be lifted to the chain-complex level and whether it is \r\nrelated to an operad action (specifically, to an action of the framed little \r\ndisks operad).  Techniques developed by McClure and Smith are well-adapted to\r\nthis question, and this is one of the directions that McClure intends to\r\npursue.\r\n",
