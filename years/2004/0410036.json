 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this collaborative project the investigators Sommese,\r\nWampler, and Verschelde construct and implement new algorithms to\r\nnumerically describe algebraic sets defined by systems of\r\nparameterized polynomial equations.  The scope of work goes\r\nbeyond conventional problems, where one seeks the solution set\r\nwhen the parameters are given, to include the determination of\r\nparameter sets that change the nature of solution components in a\r\nspecified manner.  Of special interest are solution sets whose\r\ndimension is exceptionally large.  Problems such as these, e.g.,\r\nthe discovery and classification of overconstrained mechanisms,\r\ncan be reduced to computing the irreducible decomposition of\r\ncertain exceptional loci of polynomial systems with parameters. \r\nThis is then reduced to finding the numerical irreducible\r\ndecomposition of a finite number of associated polynomial\r\nsystems.  As this leads to large systems, a new\r\nequation-by-equation approach to solving polynomial systems is\r\ndeveloped.  To tackle nontrivial problems, the algorithms is\r\nimplemented on parallel computers.\r\n\r\n     Solving a polynomial equation -- finding the roots of the\r\npolynomial -- is an old problem that occurs over and over in more\r\ncomplicated forms throughout science and engineering.  In\r\napplications involving mechanical design, finding the solution of\r\na system of polynomial equations is only one step in a larger\r\nscheme: to arrive at better designs by describing how the set of\r\nsolutions of a polynomial system depends on parameters of the\r\nsystem.  This problem arises in design of industrial robots, for\r\nexample.  The investigators develop new methods for describing\r\nthe solution sets of polynomial systems with parameters.  The\r\nmethods have the potential to become a standard tool in the\r\ndesign of robots and mechanisms.  Furthermore, the methods\r\npromise to have a wider impact on the research fields of\r\nnumerical analysis and computer algebra, especially in efforts\r\nseeking to provide the scientific community with software to\r\nsolve mathematical problems.  An important result of this work is\r\npublicly available software based on these new methods, with\r\ninterfaces facilitating use by the wider community.  By solving\r\nsome difficult polynomial systems that arise in science and\r\nengineering, the team stimulates interest in these advanced\r\nmethods and provides illustration of their usage for the\r\nnonspecialist.  The project includes collaboration with and\r\ntraining of students.\r\n",
