 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to study uniqueness for the dynamic \r\ninverse  problem for bounded, three-dimensional, anisotropic elastic \r\nmedia,  that is, to address the question: do displacement-traction \r\nmeasurements at the surface of an elastic  object uniquely determine \r\nthe density and elastic properties of the interior? In particular, \r\nthe aim is to study whether the theory predicts any ambiguities in \r\nthe sensing of the  internal properties from surface measurements, \r\nand, if so, if it is possible to characterize features of the elastic \r\nmedia that are ``hidden'' from the surface.   The PI plans (in joint \r\nwork with Anna Mazzucato) to present such an  ambiguity, an obstruction \r\nto uniqueness, by transforming the medium via diffeomorphisms that fix \r\nthe boundary to first order.   That is, the plan is to show that elastic \r\nmedia have the same  Dirichlet-to-Neumann map if they lie in the same  \r\norbit under the action of pullback via these diffeomorphisms.  \r\nA consequence of the obstruction to uniqueness is that the parameter \r\nidentification problem for large classes of anisotropic elastic  media \r\nmay be solved, in part, if it has been solved for simpler classes.  \r\nIn particular, the PI plans to extend uniqueness results  for isotropic \r\nelastodynamics to classes of (possibly composite) anisotropic elastic media. \r\nTo apply the partial uniqueness result, it is important to develop tools to \r\nidentify whether a given elastic medium is in the orbit of a certain class \r\nof elastic media (for example, isotropic). The PI plans to begin addressing \r\nthis problem by giving a pointwise  characterization of the orbits of general \r\nanisotropic elastic media under this  action. \r\n\r\nImaging technologies aid physicians in detecting and diagnosing abnormal tissue. \r\nTechniques using ultrasound, for example, have been developed recently for sensing \r\nhow the interior points of biological tissues respond when movement is initiated at the \r\nsurface. Information about how the tissue moves can be used to identify regions that \r\nare stiffer than their surroundings, and since tumors are often encapsulated in tissue \r\nwhich is stiffer than normal, this tool can have important medical applications. \r\nSince stiffness is an elastic feature, mathematicians can apply methods from the field \r\nof differential equations to contribute to this study of this inverse problem. \r\nThe PI plans to work with undergraduate and graduate students from the host  institution \r\nto present graphical results and instructive text on the internet for this inverse problem.  \r\nThis award is supported by the NSF ADVANCE Program. The overall mission of the ADVANCE \r\nProgram is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering \r\nworkforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic \r\nscience and engineering careers.",
