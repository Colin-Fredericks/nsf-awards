 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY2004. The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of scientific leadership in academia and industry. To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients.   It is expected that Fellows supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"How and why populations of Silene latifolia (white campion) differ for floral and leaf traits.\"  This study of selection mechanisms uses European populations of Silene latifolia, a native short-lived perennial, that are differentiated for floral and leaf traits.  These traits are negatively correlated across populations.  Estimates are being made of the relative importance of natural and sexual selection in driving the observed patterns.  Selection will be measured in populations that differ for water availability.  The research provides a greater understanding of the role of ecology and environment in shaping the evolution of plants. The training brings a broader perspective on the field of evolutionary ecology and career development opportunities to a young scientist early in her career.  \r\n",
