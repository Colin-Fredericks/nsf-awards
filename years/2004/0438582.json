The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-04556).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners include University of North Florida (Lead Institution), Armor Holdings, Dura Automotive, Florida Machine Works, Predator Products, The Ronco Group, Lorenz Surgical, Cornerstone Regional Development Partnership, Fresh Ministries, and First Coast Manufacturers Association.\r\n\r\nThe primary objectives are to establish a Manufacturing Innovation Partnership (MIP) Program with two primary goals: (1) to develop a shared design and manufacturing center providing resources for the local manufacturing and design companies to aid in the economic and technical development of the Northeast Florida Region, also referred to as Florida's First Coast, and (2) to improve the technical education and preparation of the future workforce in the region. The focus of the MIP Program with the shared design and manufacturing resource center is to create an environment that fosters innovations in current and new products, processes, and/or systems through project-centered manufacturing and design activities of mutual benefit to regional industry and academia.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\nThe activity will create a more competitive, prosperous company in the region in a stronger position to create high-technology jobs. In turn, the experiences gained by the student participants in the MIP Program create another broader impact of a more scientifically and technologically literate workforce trained with relevance to industry.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project will result from creating an environment that fosters innovations in current and new products, processes, and/or systems through project-centered manufacturing and design activities of mutual benefit to regional industry and academia. The outcomes of the project-centered activities are in the areas of design and manufacturing that increase the competitiveness of the partner company through innovation. Of primary significance is that the majority of the company sites that participate in areas of common interest are likely to be small with less than 50 employees. Small companies often lack the staff and resources to develop advanced design and manufacturing solutions.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the activity concentrate on catalyzing the growth and success of manufacturing companies in the region. Workforce development, including connections and mentorship programs at the high school level should help with workforce and diversity issues. The partnership seeks to attract and retain engineering students to serve the local economy, with particular focus on inner city high schools. The extensive assessment metrics are important and necessary for sustainability and for application of innovation transfer processes in other areas.\r\n",

The program has been developed to provide engineering undergraduate student opportunities in applied research and development engineering projects to create an experiential learning environment to complement their learning in the engineering programs. The MIP Program serves as a catalyst for advanced technology development and high-technology job creation in an area of the nation which has experienced rapid growth. The three primary goals of the MIP Program are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To stimulate transformation of knowledge in design and manufacturing occurring in the academic domain to the applied research and development in the industrial field through project-centered innovations developed using a shared design and manufacturing resource for technology transfer,</li>\n<li>To develop partnerships with the common goal of producing students whose education satisfies the needs of the regional workforce with a more scientifically and technologically literate workforce trained with relevance to industry including mentorship to attract and retain engineering students for the future, and</li>\n<li>To implement Florida&rsquo;s First Coast Manufacturing Innovation Partnership Program for long-term sustainability of technology transfer and creation of high-technology jobs in the engineering manufacturing and design professions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The students work in teams, primarily on-campus while also visiting the sponsoring organizations. The sponsoring organizations are primarily regional industry and biomedical interests. The students have been compensated by the resources made available from the MIP Program and the partnerships. A liaison engineer from the sponsoring organizations serves as a point of contact for project-driven requirements and information needed by the students on the MIP projects. The liaison engineers also periodically visit campus. A faculty advisor and mentor works with each team on the projects. Thus far 63 MIP students have been involved in 31 MIP projects. Note that this type of work experience is much different than the traditional engineering co-op or engineering internship experience. With a newly initiated Masters Program in engineering, opportunities for graduate students are emerging in the MIP Program. While most projects have remained well-grounded to serve in regional industry and industrial sponsorship, some projects have incorporated national and international outreach with federally funded sponsorship. The underlying characteristics remain consistent, to provide the engineering students experiential learning opportunities for applied research and development in teaming projects to supplement their academic education. Satisfying the goals above encompasses intellectual merit and broader impacts as discussed below.</p>\n<p>For goal number 1, partnerships have been created in the region with 21 total entities through project-centered innovations developed using a shared design and manufacturing resource at UNF. Of these, 12 are industry partnerships, 4 are government, 2 are academic, 2 are biomedical, and 1 is a service organization. Thirty-one innovative technical projects have been accomplished through the partnerships. Of these 31 projects, 18 are industry projects, 4 are biomedical, 2 are energy, 2 are educational, 2 are defense related, 2 are space applications, and 1 is service profession.</p>\n<p>For goal number 2, 63 MIP students have performed the 31 projects producing students whose education satisfies the needs of the regional workforce with a more scientifically and technologically literate workforce trained with relevance to industry through experiential learning. The MIP Program at UNF continues a focus on undergraduate students and research. Of the students, 55 have been undergraduate research assistants while 8 have been graduate research assistants. 48 are mechanical engineers (2 graduate students), 10 are electrical engineers (3 graduate students), 4 are computer science (3 graduate students) and one is a biology pre-med student. The MIP Program has additionally engaged in pre-college mentoring projects performed by MIP students.</p>\n<p>For goal number 3, the long-term sustainability of technology transfer and creation of high-technology jobs, of the 63 MIP students, 4 are current students. The rest have graduated with 23 pursuing careers in industry, primarily within the region, 8 went on to attend graduate school including UNF and elsewhere, 1 went to the biomedical field, 2 to the energy sector, 5 are active duty military, 2 are civilian federal employees, and 1 entered the service industry. Nine entered the private sector with 8 other unknown upon graduation. In addition to the student careers indicated above, the students received valuable experience in disseminating technical results through peer-reviewed publications. Sixty-one technical publications, including 5 journal publications, have had 31 undergraduate student co-authorships with 2 best paper awards authored by undergraduate research assistants. Seven graduate student co-authorships have also occurred. The initial manufacturing innovation line of research continues through sponsorship with regional industry while four additional lines of sponsored research in biomedical, bionics and robotics, space applications, and remote laboratory control have spun out of the MIP Program effort at UNF with collaborations extending from the region, to the nation, and internationally to experience German engineering practices.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/27/2011<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Daniel&nbsp;J&nbsp;Cox</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2011/0438582/0438582_10021306_1316967004291_mip--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2011/0438582/0438582_10021306_1316967004291_mip--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MIP\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2011/0438582/0438582_10021306_1316967004291_mip--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MIP\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Florida's First Coast Manufacturing Innovation Partnership</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">D Cox</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;J&nbsp;Cox</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MIP</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
