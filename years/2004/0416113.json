 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant to Purdue University seeks  two  years  of  NSF  funding  to  develop  a  novel  and  systematic  approach  to  better understand  the  direct  and  indirect  relationships  among  freshman  engineering  student  attributes  and outcomes. With this knowledge, the college will implement processes that: a) enable faculty and advisors to give more informed guidance to incoming freshmen about their course selections; b) foster the continuous improvement of first-year engineering experiences; c) provide a means to operationalize  the  definition  of  student  success  to  include  additional  features  (i.e., something more than simply looking at GPA and persistence in engineering); and d) facilitate our ability to investigate differences in a model of predictors and outcomes for underrepresented student groups (e.g., gender, and ethnicity), leading to more meaningful advising for these students. \r\n\r\nThis project  will develop a comprehensive evaluation process that will enable engineering faculty and advisors to better assess: the cognitive and noncognitive characteristics  of  incoming  freshman  to  more  accurately  place  students  into  the  most  appropriate introductory chemistry, engineering, mathematics, and physics courses. In addition, the project to use survey items (self-concepts and expectations), prior academic performance (high school academic record), and  student  assessment  of  their  achievement  to  understand  the  direct  and  indirect  relationships  among freshman student attributes and outcomes in order to provide the foundation for continuous improvement in our first-year engineering program, as well as provide a bases by which we can measure whether a student has had a successful first-year experience. \r\n\r\nThe current model for engineering accreditation calls for the development and implementation of a system of ongoing evaluation that demonstrates achievement of programs educational objectives, in part, through the assessment of program outcomes. However, to date, no effort has been made to relate these outcomes back to a student's starting point in the higher education system.  We believe the model proposed herein will serve in that capacity both at Purdue University and engineering institutions across the country.  \r\n\r\n",
