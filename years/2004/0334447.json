This workshop will convene April 8-10, 2004 in Serrambi, Pernambuco, Brazil.  Graduate students, early-career faculty, and senior faculty from the U.S., Brazil, Canada, and Europe will formulate research methods appropriate for studying human development in diverse sociocultural contexts.  The focus of this school will be on human development as culturally situated, both metatheoretically and in its implications for addressing developmental diversity.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will bring together young scholars from underrepresented groups in the early phases of developing research programs as well as young faculty who are in tenure-track positions at undergraduate institutions.  In addition to exposing these young researchers to scientific discussions in an international context, the workshops are expected to result in significant professional opportunities, including international joint projects and publications. \r\nThe students and faculty will work jointly on methodologies that are relevant to works in progress, particularly research programs of the young scholars, and substantive international research collaborations are expected to result.\r\n",
