 "awd_abstract_narration": "Optimization problems involving eigenvalues arise in many\r\napplications. In recent years, attention has focused on\r\nsemidefinite programs, which are linear optimization problems in\r\nthe space of real symmetric matrices, with positive semidefinite\r\nconstraints.  This project focuses on optimization problems in the\r\nlarger space of square matrices, not generally symmetric. In this\r\ncontext, it is well known that eigenvalues, which provide\r\ninformation about asymptotic behavior of dynamical systems, are\r\nnot as useful as pseudospectra, which provide a more robust\r\nmeasure of system behavior. This project focuses on the\r\ncomputation, analysis and, especially, numerical optimization of\r\npseudospectral functions. A secondary goal is to advance the\r\ndevelopment of algorithms for general nonsmooth, nonconvex\r\noptimization problems.\r\n\r\nApplications of this work arise in many contexts.  A good example\r\nthat we have used is a model of a Boeing 767 at a flutter condition.\r\nFlutter occurs when the plane flies so fast that the interaction\r\nof the aerodynamic (wind) forces with the structural forces in\r\nthe airplane combine to generate an instability which could be\r\ncatastrophic.  Normally, a plane like this does not fly so fast but\r\nit is important to know what would happen if it did, and whether a\r\nsimple controller could bring the plane under control.  Eigenvalues \r\ntell us about stability in the long term, but pseudospectra are far \r\nmore informative, telling us about stability in the short term.  \r\nOptimizing the pseudospectra over the parameters of the \r\ncontroller may result in the design of a controller that is simple \r\nyet effective in avoiding the instability and preventing catastrophe.\r\n",
