 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is providing scholarships to one cohort of 30 students to be known as Silicon Valley Scholars.  The scholarships are equally divided between majors in computer information systems and engineering. Funds to sustain scholarships for new cohorts of students would be sought from local industries in Silicon Valley. Strong support services are offered during the college years and are administered by the Financial Aid Office and the Student Academic Assistance Center.  The university's recruiters attract new students to the university from among those students participating in outreach programs.  In addition to Upward Bound and Educational Talent Search outreach programs, the university operates a charter high school for limited English speaking students who have fallen at least a year behind their classmates in reading achievement. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: Low-income students with the diverse ethnic backgrounds of the university's students have proven difficult to retain through to graduation in most universities.  The college has a track record of helping such students overcome the barriers to a full university education. The college uses a hands-on approach to teaching providing laboratory and workshop experiences for students in lower division classes and internship experiences in industry for upper division students.  This practical approach to education facilitates a high placement rate in industry for graduates. \r\n  \r\nBroader Impact:  Students who would not normally attend college and would be found rarely in computer science and engineering majors are afforded a rigorous education and support services sufficient to assure success.  Silicon Valley high technology industry receive access to a pool of well-trained potential employees to which they have heretofore lacked access. \r\n",
