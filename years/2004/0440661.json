 "awd_abstract_narration": "The North American Paleontological Convention (NAPC) is a quadrennial gathering of\r\npaleontologists from a variety of disciplines. The meeting planned for June 19 through\r\nJune 26, 2005 at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia will be the eighth NAPC. Each\r\nprevious convention has been judged an excellent opportunity for the presentation of the\r\nresults of new research and for discussions of current areas of paleontological research.\r\nOne aim of NAPC is to allow specialists who would not otherwise normally be in contact to\r\nmeet and exchange ideas. For example, micropaleontologists and vertebrate paleontologists\r\nhave different professional societies that meet at different times, yet some members of\r\nthese two groups work on fossils from the same rock units. Based on past experience, the\r\nOrganizing Committee for NAPC-2005 expects that more than 500 professionals will attend\r\nand interact during three days of meetings and on several field trips. NAPC provides an\r\noutstanding educational opportunity to obtain focused presentations of paleontological\r\ninformation from talks and poster presentations without the other distractions presented\r\nat a general geological meeting.\r\n\r\nThe Organizing Committee believes that the continued interest of students is critical to\r\nthe health of the field. Not only will students maintain the study of past life, they are\r\nthe ones who will provide fresh approaches and examine old fossils with new eyes. NAPC\r\nallows students the ready opportunity to meet with leaders in the field and to discuss\r\ntheir research in progress, both formally and informally, in a venue not provided by a\r\nnational or regional geologic meeting.",
