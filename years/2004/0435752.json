 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific and educational objectives of this Small Grant for Exploratory Research project are to: examine the horizontal and vertical distribution of grazing zooplankton in the Mackenzie River and at its freshwater/saltwater interface; examine the fate of zooplankton derived DOM and CDOM associated with the Mackenzie River; develop a website that features video and digital images from the field project; initiate a school pen pal program involving data exchange (on topics such as temperature, light, seasons, animals, etc.) between the Sir Alexander MacKenzie School in Inuvik, NWT Canada and the Helen Keller Elementary School in Franklin MA USA; create and present hands-on activities on Arctic life and processes to students at Helen Keller Elementary School and the James J Chittick School during the Excellence in Science, Technology and Mathematics Education (ESTME) week.\r\n\r\nThe Arctic is often viewed as a harsh, inhospitable place that is deserted and remote. In reality, it is a highly dynamic area that supports a large amount of marine life and is home to many indigenous people. While scientists need to study this region in order to understand, model and predict the effects of global warming on this fragile and important ecosystem, future scientists (elementary students) and the public need to become more aware of this region and to learn about Arctic life and processes in order to protect this ecosystem and understand its connection to the world. This project will initiate a new program on accessible Arctic education for the public and elementary students. \r\n\r\nLittle is known about zooplankton processes and inputs to dissolved organic matter  (DOM) in the near-coast environment. This project will provide the first information on fine-scale distribution of grazing zooplankton and zooplankton inputs to dissolved organic matter in coastal Arctic waters. The potential changes to Arctic shelves resulting from loss of ice coverage could change the dynamics of dissolve organic matter cycling, making this region sensitive to climate change. \r\n",
