 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Nelder-Mead ``simplex'' method, first published in 1965,\r\nis one of the world's most popular techniques for unconstrained\r\nminimization of nonlinear functions without using derivatives;\r\nNelder-Mead lies at the heart of hundreds, probably thousands,\r\nof scientific and engineering applications that involve\r\noptimization.\r\n\r\nThe virtues of the Nelder-Mead method include simplicity of\r\ndescription and implementation, and excellent ``best case''\r\nbehavior, especially in achieving rapid improvement with\r\na relatively small number of function values.  Its flaws\r\ninclude stagnation or failure, typically slow and painful.\r\nAnd, despite almost 40 years of widespread use, its\r\nfundamental nature remains unclear and even mysterious.\r\nThe proposed research aims to improve understanding of\r\nthe Nelder-Mead method in both theory and practice.\r\n\r\nNo theoretical convergence results for the original\r\nNelder-Mead method were obtained until 1998, and its\r\nknown theory today is limited (to dimensions one and\r\ntwo) as well as relatively, perhaps unavoidably, weak.\r\nIt is almost embarrassing that the mathematical and\r\nconvergence properties of this nearly ubiquitous, seemingly\r\nsimple method are not fully settled.  In attempting to\r\nproduce the needed theory, the proposed research will apply\r\ntools like discrete dynamical systems and characterization of\r\ngeometric properties, which are nonstandard in analysis of\r\nunconstrained optimization.\r\n\r\nSince non-derivative optimization methods have been\r\ndeveloped in the last 15 years that possess essentially\r\ncomplete theories, one might wonder why it is worthwhile\r\nto study the Nelder-Mead method.  The reason is that,\r\ndespite its lack of known theoretical underpinnings,\r\nNelder-Mead very often produces a good enough answer\r\nmore rapidly than its competitors.   But Nelder-Mead does\r\nnot consistently work well---its performance is sometimes\r\nexcellent, sometimes terrible---and the reasons for this\r\nvariation have not been examined in detail.  A second part\r\nof the proposed research is to explore what happens (and\r\nwhy) to the method on a large, carefully selected set of\r\ntest problems.  A hope is that ``Nelder-Mead-like'' methods\r\nwill emerge that retain the flavor and desirable properties\r\nof the original but overcome its worst flaws.\r\n\r\nGiven the popularity of the Nelder-Mead method, the result\r\nof the research should be improved non-derivative optimization\r\nmethods that are capable of reliably solving a variety of\r\nscientific and engineering problems.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator was one of the first to prove\r\ntheoretical results about the original Nelder-Mead method\r\nand to focus attention on the Nelder-Mead method, which\r\nwas scorned or ignored for many years by the mainstream\r\noptimization community.  While at Bell Labs, she gained\r\npractical experience by implementing the Nelder-Mead\r\nmethod in a successful product (the ``WISE'' tool for\r\nwireless system design).\r\n\r\nBecause the Nelder-Mead method is easy to visualize and\r\nexplain, it is an obvious candidate for Web-based dissemination\r\nof animations and explanatory material that can be used in\r\ngraduate and undergraduate education, as well as by\r\npractitioners, in science, engineering, and medicine.\r\n",
