SHARP\r\nINSTITUTION:\t\t\tPENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\n\r\nCAREER:  PARTICLE EFFECTS IN MICROFLUIDICS\r\n\r\nThe research program consists primarily of an experimental study of the consequences and science underlying a particular subset of particle effects and particle transport in pressure-driven and electrokinetic micro fluidic systems.  The specific flows of interest are those in which the particle diameter is of the same order of magnitude as the characteristic dimension of the characteristic micro fluidic device dimension.  This regime traditionally has not been encountered in macroscale particle-laden flows, but is expected to gain importance for particle-based assay or micro/nano-fabrication applications given the continued efforts at device miniaturization.  Over the longer term, the proposed research program will lay the groundwork for an expansion of scope, namely to include the study of nanoparticle transport in nanoscale systems.  Broad impacts of the work include significant educational and outreach components.  The proposed educational program aims to increase the participation of traditionally under-represented groups in science and engineering and, ultimately, related professions, by providing a unique environment for active discussion of the broader context of science and research.  This program, entitled Expanding View will initially be designed around the broader issues of Micro and Nanoscale Science and Engineering and will be offered as an annual Seminar Course with administrative assistance from the Women in Engineering Program Office at Penn State.  Through Expanding View, undergraduate students will have the opportunity to engage in team-oriented problem-solving coupled with effective mentoring and peer interactions, and participate in both on- and off-campus discussions of 'big-picture' topics such as the societal impact of research, the effects of public policy decisions on research directions, diversity in the workforce, and international competitiveness. \r\n\r\n\r\n*co-funded jointly by the Fluid Dynamics & Hydraulics, and Particulate and Multiphase Processes programs\r\n\r\n\r\n",
