 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award from the Chemistry Division supports an Undergraduate Research Center (URC) planning grant.  The PI is Thomas Wolosz.  The center will be based at SUNY Plattsburgh, Departments of Chemistry, Physics and the Lake Champlain Research Institute.  Collaborators are Clinton Community College, North Country Community College, Trudeau Institute, Brookhaven National Laboratory and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals (Rouses Point, NY).  The first goal of the planning program is to design a means of incorporating undergraduate research into the freshman level experience through modification of the introductory chemistry laboratory and lecture.  This will be approached through a series of meetings of representatives of all partner institutions.  These meetings will also explore faculty mentoring and facilities improvement issues.  Logistical and scheduling problems among widely dispersed partners will be investigated.  Planning efforts will be reviewed and evaluated at quarterly meetings rotating at different partner sites during the project period.",
