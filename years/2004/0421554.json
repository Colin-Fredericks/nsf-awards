 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, developing a Highly Interactive Parallelized Display Wall (HIPerWall) new visualization facility, aims at advancing the state of Earth Science modeling and visualization. HIPerWall is a high performance visualization system with a wall-sized ultra high-density tiled display that operates at the perception threshold of the human eye, allowing researchers to view and manipulate their data sets at resolutions commensurate with large-scale grids or dense sensor network data. The facility will be able to display extremely high-resolution datasets that will drive and provide focus for on-going research into management, transfer, and visualization of terabyte-scale data. By rapid, visual comparison of theory with experimental data, scientists should be able to swiftly validate and comprehend theory and practice. Although the proposed research is focused on Earth System Sciences, other research areas will benefit, including,\r\nComputational Fluid Dynamics \r\n\tDirect numerical simulation of turbulent chemically reacting and dispersed 2-phase flows,\r\nEngineering Mechanics \r\n                 System identification using 3D video tracking; \r\no\tMicrowave imaging for damage visualization; \r\no\tRemote system monitoring,\r\nStructural and Earthquake Engineering \r\no\tAdvanced scientific visualization of dynamics of systems; \r\no\tModel-based simulation of experimental data from large and medium scale earthquake testing;\r\no\t Analysis of large-scale earthquake field data,\r\nMaterials and Devices \r\no\tMolecular modeling and visualization; \r\no\tSynthesis of structural materials and composites; \r\no\tMathematical modeling of advanced materials and processes; \r\no\tMaterial characterization,\r\nEmbodied Interaction in Immersive Systems \r\no\tNovel sensor technologies and modes of interaction for cultural and technical applications,\r\nScientific Computing, \r\no\tLarge scale data visualization;\r\no\tStorage, compression and access of stored real time simulation data; \r\no\tImage based rendering; \r\no\t3D data reconstruction, and \r\nBiomedical Engineering \r\no\tComputer simulation and tissue engineering; \r\no\tImaging and image understanding.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  The facility, to be set in a large classroom, directly contributes to education through courses and recruiting efforts. The display wall benefits collaborations that have impact on areas such as homeland security and emergency response.\r\n",
