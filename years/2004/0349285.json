 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Phase 3 of the Model Institutions for Excellence (MIE) program, Xavier University will endeavor to complete the process of infrastructure development and institutionalization of key components of an institutional Model for preparing undergraduate Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students for graduate and professional school pursuits.\r\n\r\nThroughout the course of the MIE program, the University has employed metrics that have served as a guide in the development of program strategies and ensuring attainment of the overall goal of becoming a Model Institution for Excellence in graduate school placement.  Those metrics have included and remain a) achieving a STEM student retention rate of 75% through graduation (within a six-year period), and b) achieving and sustaining a STEM student graduate school enrollment rate of 50% of Xavier STEM graduates.\r\n\r\nDuring this final stage (Phase 3) of MIE the key objectives that will be pursued by the University will include the following items.\r\n\r\n                 Transitioning of NSF financial assistance for STEM Fellows to other non-NSF University assistance resources.\r\n\tTransforming the Xavier University Center for Undergraduate Research (XUCUR), which was initiated with NSF support (with a focus on STEM students), into an institutionalized, University-supported, centralized structure that will administer to all students (STEM and otherwise) in their preparation for graduate/professional school.\r\n\tDevelopment of a degree program in Electrical Engineering as a complement to the previously-established Computer Engineering degree.  \r\n\tCompleting the development of multi-media classrooms and conferencing centers in support of the continued University expansion in the use of technology in the instructional process.\r\n\tFinalizing the formation of a University structure that will optimize the number and availability of research faculty to serve as mentors for STEM undergraduate researchers.\r\n\r\nUpon accomplishment of these objectives, the University expects to realize successful completion of all major elements of its Model for achieving excellence in the graduate school placement of its alumni.\r\n",
