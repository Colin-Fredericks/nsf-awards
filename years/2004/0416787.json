 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program provides partial support to Wisconsin Lutheran College in the development of an ultrasonic imaging system for investigating Rayleigh-Benard convection in opaque, low Prandtl number liquids. The MRI program supports the acquisition of the major equipment the Basic Energy Sciences at the Department of Energy supports the manpower.   Successful operation of the ultrasonic imaging apparatus has the potential to develop into a much broader research program addressing problems in pattern formation in alloys, Ferro fluids, opaque gels, and liquid metals under thermal or magnetic stresses; such problems are of practical interest to both earth scientists and materials scientists. Aside from advancing fundamental knowledge and understanding, the project will serve as a vehicle for teaching scientific reasoning and technical skills to up to five undergraduate students over the course of four years. Finally, the project will strengthen the research and teaching infrastructure at a small liberal arts college by supporting the development of a major piece of scientific apparatus and the acquisition of auxiliary scientific hardware that can be used in undergraduate experimental physics courses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program provides partial support to Wisconsin Lutheran College in the development of an ultrasonic imaging system for investigating Rayleigh-Benard convection in opaque, low Prandtl number liquids.
