 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at Columbia University is to investigate mesoscopic thermal and thermoelectrical transport properties in nanoscale materials. In this research, innovative experimental techniques based on microfabrication, microelectromechanical systems techniques, and thermal imaging scanning probe microscopy will be employed to explore new physical phenomena in these materials at quantum transport limit. Specifically, electrical conductance, thermal conductance, and thermoelectric power will be measured in carbon nanotubes and various nanowires using specially designed submicron scale devices. This investigation will unveil the relationship between reversible and irreversible transport processes of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics at mesoscopic scales. In addition, the proposed research will help to search for thermoelectric applications of nanoscale materials in the quantum transport regime. The educational component of this proposal is intended to enhance synergetic effects in both research and education. In particular, an interactive physics demonstration laboratory for local high school science class with the aid of the web page based internet communications is planned. This activity is designed to foster interests of local underrepresented student group in science and technology.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the electrical transport in nanometer scaled systems has been studied extensively, the investigation of the thermal and thermoelectric transport has received much less attention. The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at Columbia University is to explore new thermal transport and thermoelectric phenomena in low-dimensional materials, particularly when the quantum mechanical coherence length of the energy-carrying particles is comparable to the sample dimensions. This investigation will unveil the relationship between reversible and irreversible transport processes of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics in nanometer scaled materials. Furthermore, the unique thermoelectric properties of the low-dimensional nanometer scaled materials make them potential candidates for replacing century old technologies of refrigeration and electricity generation. This proposal seeks to find applications of these materials for thermoelectric cooling and generation, which lays the bases for a clean future energy technology using nanoscience. The educational component of this proposal emphasizes interactively integrated educational/research programs for local high school and undergraduate science education. The proposed internet based program will promote understanding of science among students, and also will help to encourage the participation of underrepresented groups in science and technology progress.\r\n",
