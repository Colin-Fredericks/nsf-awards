 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lu, Yunfeng \r\nTulane University\r\n\r\n\"NER: Hydrogen Separation by Hierarchical Palladium/Inorganic Nanocomposite Membranes\"\r\n\r\nHydrogen separation is a key component of the future hydrogen energy economy. Hydrogen separation membranes constitute the forefront in this field because of their low cost and applicability to high temperature feedstreams in refineries. However, before wide-scale commercial implementation can occur, more durable and efficient membranes must be synthesized in an inexpensive and simple manner.\r\n\r\nThis experimental research directly addresses these challenges by developing nanostructured palladium alloy/ inorganic membrane assemblies with improved membrane mechanical stability, lower overall membrane costs, and significantly improved hydrogen permeability and selectivity. Devices will be fabricated using template-assisted electrodeposition inside surfactant templated mesoporous silica layers that have controllable, ordered pore structures. The electrodeposition of palladium and palladium alloys produces a thin, dense, nanocrystalline metal/ silica nanocomposite with hierarchical structural control on an alumina membrane support. The unique properties endowed by the nanoscale palladium structure will result in enhanced hydrogen transport properties due to new diffusion pathways. A molecular dynamics mathematical model will describe the hydrogen transport in the bulk, in the grain boundaries, and on the internal metal surface. This study will provide a fundamental understanding of the different routes and mechanisms for diffusion through a nanoscale material. The knowledge gained can be applied to other nanomaterial projects and future membrane applications.\r\n\r\nSuccess of this project will directly answer the current hydrogen separation challenges and prepare this field for the future hydrogen energy economy. All results from this research will be quickly disseminated to the general public in the form of peer reviewed journal articles and presentations at national scientific conferences. The educational plan is built on general teaching techniques and available education infrastructure in the area. Because of limited nanotechnology funding and education in the area, the PI will focus on improving education in this region through nanotechnology programs, courses, and conferences. The educational program will focus on the unique properties of nanomaterials, laboratory and industrial synthesis techniques, advanced device fabrication, and possible solutions to our energy needs through nanotechnology. This project will incorporate Nanoscale science and engineering (NSE) education into the current department curriculum in order to prepare students to become the future, as well as the present, technological workforce. \r\n\r\n",
