Burago proposes to continue his work on a number of long-term\r\nprojects in Riemannian and Finsler geometry, dynamical systems of\r\ngeometric origin, and geometric group theory. The projects\r\ninclude: geometry of periodic metrics, area-minimizing surfaces\r\nin normed spaces and minimal fillings, and ellipticity of surface\r\narea functionals; low dimensional partially hyperbolic\r\ndiffeomorphisms; unbounded bi-invariant quasi-semi-norms and\r\n\"large\" groups; manifolds without conjugate points; applications\r\nof singular geometry to dynamics of billiard systems and certain\r\nalgorithmic problems of geometric origin; and approximations by\r\nPL-isometries.  Among the problems the proposal is aimed at there\r\nare: Busemann's Conjecture that flats are area-minimizing\r\nsurfaces in normed spaces; styding the structure of the class of\r\npartially-hyperbolic systems; finding weak versions of Hofer's\r\nnorm (possibly on some groups of volume-preserving\r\nhomeomorphisms); various generalizations of E.Hopf's conjecture\r\non tori without conjugate points. This project continues the\r\nproposer's previous research, including a solution of the E. Hopf\r\nconjecture on tori without conjugate points posed by Hedlund and\r\nMorse in the 40s, a \"Boltzman-Sinaj\" problem on the existence of\r\nuniform estimates on the number of collisions in hard ball gas\r\nmodels, the two-dimensional case of H. Busemann's problem\r\nmentioned above, H. Furstenberg's problem on the existence of\r\nbi-Lipschits non-equivalent separated nets and J. Moser's problem\r\non the existence of a continuous function that is not a Jacobian\r\ndeterminant of a Lipschits homeomorphism (all from the 60s). The\r\nconjectures and directions of research suggested in the proposal\r\ngrew from ideas and methods developed by the proposer and his\r\ncollaborators while working on these problems.\r\n\r\nEven though most topics of the proposal belong to rather abstract\r\nareas of mathematics, their motivations lie in real-word\r\nproblems.  The physical analogs of large-scale invariants of\r\nperiodic metrics are macroscopic properties of periodic media\r\n(such as crystal substances: i.e., the rate of propagation of\r\nradiation etc), and one wants to relate these properties to\r\nmicroscopic characteristics. Hyperbolic dynamics is really well\r\nunderstood, and it forms the first and the simplest example of\r\nchaotic models; however, little is know about partially\r\nhyperbolic systems, which offer a much more realistic model; the\r\nproject is aimed in giving new insight into such systems with a\r\nsmall number of degrees of freedom. The \"Boltzman-Sinaj\" problem\r\non the existence of uniform estimates on the number of collisions\r\nin hard ball gas models originated from the most basic research\r\nin statistical physics. Study of the geodesic flows, billiard\r\nsystems, geometric complexity, and optimal strategies may result\r\nin better understanding of (stability) of certain models in\r\nthermodynamics, biology, sociology, and physics, especially when\r\ndealing with imprecise data, and perhaps result in new\r\ncomputational algorithms.\r\n",
