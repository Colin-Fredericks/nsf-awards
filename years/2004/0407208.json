 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to Case Western Reserve University supports Dr. Alexis Abramson, Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Case Western Reserve University to develop \"Nanoworlds\" - a durable, scalable, content-rich, multi-level, user-negotiable, web-facilitated seminar format for the learning of and discussion of nanotechnology. This undergraduate seminar to be offered at Case will present nanotechnology from the points of view of the scientific, technological, social and economic impact perspectives. Nanoworlds is an early years undergraduate course suitable for general audiences, which uses material in a co-developed digitally archived web encyclopedia resource known as the Nanopedia. The Nanoworlds seminar will enable learning of an elemental core of nanoscience and nanoengineering concepts. Additionally, class members will explore various paths in the Nanopedia (and beyond) according to their interests for general discussion and in-depth reporting. These electronic paths of the Nanopedia include the evolving business portfolio triggered by the nanoworld, public policy issues, nanotechnology in emerging everyday products, limits to technology's reach, the science and art museums of nanotechnology, etc. The encyclopedia functions as a highly interconnected resource for both core and elective topics. Nanopedia content will be multiply-authored and multiply-edited, and content contributions will sought from acknowledged experts in the field as well as from the course professors. Additionally, the Nanopedia, as further developed under this award, will be used as a complementary resource for the engineering core courses offered at Case to facilitate integration of concepts relating to nanoscience and nanoengineering into these more traditionally oriented courses.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education announcement, NSF 03-044, category NUE and was funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) in the Directorate for Engineering.\r\n\r\n",
