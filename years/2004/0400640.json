He has been investigating questions about certain\r\ninteresting subgroups, for example, arithmetic subgroups or other large\r\n(Zariski-dense) subgroups which arise in geometry or number theory. It\r\nwould be important to determine all normal subgroups of these groups. Over\r\ninteresting fields like local and global fields, there are conjectures of\r\nKneser-Tits and Margulis-Platonov which provide a description of normal\r\nsubgroups. These conjectures have been settled in the affirmative for many\r\nclass of groups. However, there still remain some very interesting groups\r\nfor which these conjectures are open.  Prasad plans to study these groups.\r\nFor arithmetic groups, the famous \"congruence subgroup problem\" is the\r\nquestion whether any normal subgroup of finite index contains a congruence\r\nsubgroup. The most successful approach to settling this problem has two\r\nparts: (1) Computation of the \"metapectic kernel\". (2) Centrality of the\r\ncongruence subgroup kernel.  A very precise computation of the metaplectic\r\nkernel for all groups has been done in Prasad's joint work with\r\nM.S.Raghunathan and A.S.Rapinchuk. On the other hand, the centrality of\r\nthe congruence subgroup kernel is still unknown for some important class\r\nof groups. Prasad's goal is to investigate these groups and also find a\r\nconceptually better proof of the centrality in the known cases. He will\r\ncontinue his collaboration with A.S. Rapinchuk on this project. Another\r\ntopic on which Prasad will work on is the representation theory of\r\nreductive p-adic groups. Prasad has been interested in classification of\r\nirreducible admissible representations where his goal is to obtain a\r\nclassification in terms of theory of \"types\". A begining in this\r\ndirection, for general reductive groups, was made in his joint work with\r\nAllen Moy--the geometric techniques which they introduced in\r\nrepresentation theory have turned out to be very useful. Prasad plans to\r\ncontinue his research towards classification of admissible\r\nrepresentations.\r\n\r\n The set of symmetries of many geometric and number theoretic objects form\r\na group. For studying these geometric and number theoretic objects, it is\r\nimportant to study their groups of symmetries. Prasad has been studying\r\nproblems related to these groups and their subgroups. These problems have\r\nnumber theoretic or geometric origins and therefore their solution will\r\nhave important applications to these areas. Prasad proposes to work on the\r\nKneser-Tits and Margulis-Platonov problems which provide conjectural\r\ndescription of normal subgroups; both the problems have been settled for a\r\nlarge class of groups but some challenging cases remain open. Prasad also\r\nproposes to continue his work on the famous congruence subgroup problem\r\nwhere he and his collaborators Raghunathan and Rapinchuk have made many\r\nimportant contributions. In another direction, Prasad proposes to work on\r\nthe representation theory of reductive p-adic groups. Representations of\r\nthese groups arise naturally in various contexts and their study is an\r\nimportant component of the Langlands program in modern number theory. The\r\ngeometric methods which Prasad and Allen Moy introduced in the area have\r\nturned out to be very useful. Prasad proposes to refine these methods to\r\ngive a complete classification of all admissible representations.\r\n",
