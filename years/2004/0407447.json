 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to California State University-Long Beach (CSULB) supports Dr. Tulin E. Mangir, Department of Electrical Engineering, Dr. Chuhee Kwon, Department of Physics and Astronomy, and Dr. Andrew Z. Mason, Department of Biological Sciences for their work to develop lower division classes at CSULB in the areas of nano-sciences and nano-technology.\r\n\r\nThis proposal requests funding to enable CSULB to pro-actively expand and develop curricula for both, undergraduate major and non-major students, and also to add a teacher training component to increase general awareness and promote career options to fill the vacant capacity in this rapidly growing discipline.\r\n\r\nThe proposal aims to accomplish the following goals: 1) development of an interdisciplinary survey course on nano-technology designed for engineering and science majors in their sophomore and/junior year; 2) development of a junior/senior course with a combination of lecture and laboratory that provides students with an in-depth understanding of the techniques used in nanoscale science and engineering; and 3) generation of web-based resources and interaction modules designed for distance learning aimed specifically for science and engineering teacher preparation classes. The courses will cover specific application examples in life sciences, biotechnology and medicine, physics, materials electronics environmental monitoring, and expose students to use of instrumentation such as AFM, SEM, X-Ray Microscopes, Remote Monitoring of Robots (Tele-robotoics) and Nano-robots, web-based laboratory modules.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education (NSEE) announcement, NSF 03-044, category NUE and was jointly funded by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) in the Directorate for Engineering (ENG)and the Division of Materials Research (DMR) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS).",
