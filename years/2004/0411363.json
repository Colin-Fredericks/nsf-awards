 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manna - Abstract: \r\n\r\nStatic analysis methods play two vital roles in the design of embedded\r\nsystems: validation and optimization.  A static analysis technique\r\ndeduces properties of a given system by analyzing its description.\r\nIts applicability to a particular system hinges upon its ability to\r\ndeduce interesting properties while balancing the computational cost.\r\nThis research studies a novel class of techniques for\r\nstatic analysis that has the potential to significantly increase the\r\nscope of static analysis. \r\n\r\nThe methodology, called constraint-based static analysis, diverges\r\nfrom previous work on static analysis. Whereas traditional\r\npropagation-based static analysis methods concentrate on iteratively\r\nconstructing better approximations to the desired properties, the\r\nproposed approach directly solves for the properties.  Given a class\r\nof assertions represented parametrically by a template property, a\r\nconstraint-based method generates and solves constraints on the\r\nunknown parameters.  This shift in strategy seeks the following\r\nadvantages:\r\n\r\n* It replaces heuristic guesses with a precise and predictable\r\n  approach to approximation. Traditional approaches frequently \r\n  require the use of heuristic guesses via widening and narrowing\r\n  operators, which has limited their applicability.\r\n* In contrast to propagation-based methods, the new methods can be \r\n  readily optimized to handle special cases effectively.\r\n* It enables a natural extension to the analysis of nonlinear\r\n  discrete and hybrid systems. \r\n* The constraint-based methods for real-time and hybrid systems avoid \r\n  explicitly solving differential equations, making them applicable\r\n  to a larger class of systems.\r\n\r\nThe expected benefits of this research are many. Static analysis has not seen a major breakthrough in a decade. The project hopes to revive interest in static analysis and encourage the use of mathematical techniques such as Groebner bases. This research also links constraint solving technology to verification, thus opening\r\nopportunities for involvement of the constraint solving community\r\nin problems pertinent to the design of embedded systems.  Finally, the\r\nresults of this research bring closer the feasibility of using formal proof of safety properties in certifying software for safety-critical devices.\r\n",
