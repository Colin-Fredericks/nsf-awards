The objective of the Conference is to bring together international researchers and industrial practitioners to present and discuss their results on the science and technology of inorganic membranes and to gain better understanding of the synthesis, characterization and application of inorganic membranes.   The previous three conferences of this series were held overseas in China, France, and Japan.  The ICIM8 Conference will cover both theoretical and experimental aspects of inorganic membranes relating to separation and membrane reactor technology.  The total number of participants is expected to be about 300 with approximately 120-160 from the U.S., 60-80 from Europe, and 80-120 from Japan, China, Austria and other Asia countries.   The NSF funds will support about 30 U.S. students and young researchers to participate in this conference.  In terms of the broader impacts, participation in the ICIM8 Conference by U.S. students and young researchers will provide training for the workforce in inorganic membrane science and engineering.   Their exposure to the international community of membrane scientists and researchers will greatly enhance the U.S. competitiveness in the emerging area of inorganic membrane technology.\r\n",
