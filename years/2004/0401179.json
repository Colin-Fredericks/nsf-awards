More specifically, the PI proposes to study the\r\nfollowing questions that will help to understand the essence of the\r\nnew difficulties and the possible ways of their resolution:\r\n1) the continuity of the derivatives in the obstacle problem for the\r\nsub-Laplacian in the  Heisenberg group; 2) the classification of\r\nhomogeneous global solutions of the obstacle problem for the\r\np-Laplacian in the plane; 3) uniform convergence of the level sets\r\nin a degenerate phase-transition model; 4) smoothness of the free\r\nboundary in a degenerate Bernoulli-type problem in the plane; and 5)\r\none-phase obstacle and Stefan type problems with no sign restrictions\r\non solutions. Some of the problems can be attacked by using recently\r\ndeveloped methods, while a revitalization of some older methods might\r\nprove successful in other cases. Partial results as well as\r\nempirical evidence (in some cases) are provided to support the expected\r\nand conjectured results.\r\n\r\nFree boundaries are apriori unknown sets, coming up in solutions of\r\npartial differential equations and variational problems. Typical\r\nexamples are the interfaces and moving boundaries in problems on phase\r\ntransitions and fluid mechanics. Main questions of interest are the\r\nregularity (smoothness) of free boundaries and their structure. Thanks\r\nto the contributions by many mathematicians the theory of free\r\nboundaries has developed over the last decades to a very deep and\r\nbeautiful part of mathematics. However, in a number of free\r\nboundary problems that arise in applications, ranging from geometry\r\nand optimal control to robotics and superconductivity, certain\r\ntraditional assumptions may break down. The aim of this\r\nproposal is to understand which results could be carried over from the\r\nclassical theory of free boundaries to the case of those problems.\r\n\r\n",
