 "awd_abstract_narration": "0348501\r\nRana\r\n\r\nThe research proposed here for the NSF CAREER award endeavors to develop radically new technologies that will enable semiconductor lasers to generate ultrashort optical pulses. The goals of the proposed research are to develop semiconductor modelocked lasers that can produce stable optical pulses shorter than 50 fs with pulse energies larger than 100 pJs. These goals will be accomplished through a synthesis of ideas from nanotechnology, ultrafast optics, material science, and device physics, such as a) quantum dot gain mediums to achieve wide gain bandwidth, zero chirp, and zero group velocity dispersion all at the same time, b) ultrafast devices based on intersubband transitions in nanostructures for generating stable ultrashort pulses with high pulse energies, and c) soliton-like pulse shaping mechanisms using artificially created Kerr nonlinearities in semiconductor nanostructures. In addition, fundamental aspects of ultrashort pulse generation in semiconductor lasers will be explored both theoretically and experimentally including issues related to pulse stability and noise, ultrafast carrier dynamics in semiconductor nanostructures, and pulse shaping mechanisms in the sub-100 fs regime where pulse widths are of the same order as the carrier intraband relaxation times in semiconductors. \r\n\r\nA successful demonstration of electrically pumped semiconductor laser sources that are compact, produce high energy stable ultrashort pulses, and cost 100 times less than solid state lasers will have a significant impact in many different areas including nanotechnology and materials research, biomedical research, healthcare and medical research, chemical and reaction kinetics, detection, sensing, diagnostics, imaging, and optical communication systems. \r\n\r\nThe impact on education of the proposed career plan will be in the development of course curricula for the Electrical Engineering Department at Cornell University that will synthesize various perspectives of electrical engineering, semiconductor optoelectronics, ultrafast optics, nanotechnology, and device physics at the undergraduate and graduate levels. In addition, summer workshops for high school students and lectures and demonstrations for middle school students will be organized. A program will be initiated to promote interest in sciences among middle school students from a local native Indian school through hands on experiments.\r\n\r\n",
