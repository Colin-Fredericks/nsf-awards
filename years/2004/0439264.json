The investigators\r\npropose to study the Iwasawa theory of modular forms with supersingular\r\nreduction.  A primary focus of this work is the behavior of Iwasawa\r\ninvariants in p-adic analytic families of modular forms such as the\r\neigencurve of Coleman and Mazur.  In fact, the definitions of these\r\ninvariants, well known in the ordinary case, are not yet known in general\r\nin the supersingular case.  In order to define and study the algebraic\r\nIwasawa invariants the PI's intend to use the p-adic Hodge theory of\r\nFontaine to study the growth of Selmer groups of modular forms over\r\ncyclotomic fields.  The definitions of the analytic invariants should be\r\nrelated to special values of modular L-functions; exhibiting the desired\r\nbehavior in families will involve a study of congruences of special values\r\nof modular L-functions, a recurring theme in much recent work.  An\r\neventual goal of this project is to show that the main conjecture of\r\nIwasawa theory can be checked for an entire family by checking it for a\r\nsingle form in the family.  The investigators also intend to study the\r\ngeneralization of the Riemann-Hurwitz type formula of Kida, Hachimori and\r\nMatsuno, which describe the change in p-adic Iwasawa invariants over\r\np-extensions of number fields, to modular forms of higher weight.\r\n\r\nNumber theory, often considered the oldest mathematical discipline, has in\r\nrecent times developed remarkable applications to cryptography. Many of\r\nthese applications involve arithmetic geometric objects known as elliptic\r\ncurves.  Modular forms, the primary object of study in this proposal, are\r\ngeneralizations of elliptic curves which play a fundamental role in modern\r\nnumber theory.  The questions investigated in this proposal deal with\r\ninvariants which are closely related to those of interest in cryptography\r\nand may perhaps yield some insight into them. \r\n\r\n",
