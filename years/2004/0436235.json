 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) proposes to hold a \r\nworkshop addressing the issues surrounding graduate student and postdoctoral support.  This \r\nevent is part of a series of events co-sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the \r\nCouncil of Graduate Schools (CGS), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) designed to \r\nexamine and improve knowledge and practice in graduate education and research training.     \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThere are many who believe that the US is facing a critical shortage of citizens trained in \r\nscience, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. This workshop will address \r\nthis issue by examining the factors that lead students to pursue graduate education and \r\npostdoctoral training in STEM areas, focusing especially on the critical role that financial \r\nsupport and benefits play in preparing a technological workforce.   \r\n \r\nAAAS will work cooperatively with the NSF Division of Graduate Education to organize a two-\r\nday workshop to be held at AAAS headquarters in Washington, DC on June 17-18, 2004.  The \r\nworkshop will consider the role and impact of student financial support in promoting the \r\nproduction of more and better prepared US citizens in STEM fields.  The conference will \r\nexamine the interplay between components of graduates student support such as mode, duration \r\nand amount of stipend, as well as health care and other benefits.  These elements will be \r\nconsidered in relationship to indicators of student progress such as completion rate, time to \r\ndegree and time to first position.  The meeting will also explore the economic impacts of \r\ngraduate and postdoctoral compensation on the research enterprise and on the domestic scientific \r\nlabor market overall.   \r\n \r\nThe meeting will involve one hundred participants including graduate students; postdoctoral \r\nresearchers; STEM faculty and deans; labor economists; and representatives from industry and \r\nresearch funding organizations.  It will be held at AAAS Headquarters in downtown \r\nWashington, DC, for convenient access.  The information shared at this meeting, combined with \r\nthe policy recommendations developed, will significantly advance knowledge and practice in \r\ngraduate education.  A crucial group of stakeholders will be empowered to create and \r\ndisseminate a set of best practices surrounding mode, duration and amount of student support. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe outcome of the workshop will be a set of best-practices and identification of knowledge gaps \r\nto be addressed by future research on these topics.  It will also help to build a community of \r\nresearchers, educators, and stakeholders who will maintain an ongoing dialogue in this critical \r\narea.  AAAS will work with NSF to disseminate these findings broadly.   \r\n \r\nThis meeting will advance our understanding of how the many facets of graduate student support \r\ncontribute to creating the US STEM workforce, and it will promote the leadership of a more \r\nknowledgeable and invested set of stakeholders.  The best practices guidelines developed at this \r\nmeeting will be disseminated widely by the meeting organizers and participants, and will lead to \r\ninfrastructure changes that will enhance graduate education nationwide.  The meeting will also \r\naddress how changes in mode and amount of support may differentially affect underrepresented \r\ngroups along racial, gender or socioeconomic lines.",
