 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software correctness is essential to avoid costly or catastrophic\r\nfailures in modern safety-critical systems, such as the ones relied\r\nupon by NASA.  Model checking is a verification technique that checks\r\nthe correctness of a system by exhaustively exploring all of its\r\npossible behaviors.  It has proven successful in the development of\r\nhardware designs and is used by Intel and other major hardware\r\ncompanies. Before model checking can significantly improve the\r\nreliability of mission critical software, a number of basic research\r\nproblems must be addressed. The extraordinary complexity of real\r\nsystems results in an explosion in the possible behaviors that need to\r\nbe checked.  The techniques devised to mitigate this problem for\r\nhardware can also be applied to software; however, some of the most\r\nsuccessful ones, such as symbolic model checking, have proven\r\ndifficult to apply in this new domain. \r\n\r\nThe primary direction of this research is to adapt these techniques to\r\nthe task of checking concurrent software.  Fundamental changes to the\r\nalgorithms are required due to the different characteristics of\r\nhardware and software systems. Modern software systems are often\r\ndeveloped using object-oriented languages, such as C++ and Java. While\r\nobject-oriented languages ease the design phase, they introduce\r\nadditional challenges for verification. One important characteristic\r\nof modern object-oriented software designs is the dynamic creation of\r\nthreads and objects. This research aims at leveraging existing\r\ntechniques, such as the partial-order reduction and symbolic model\r\nchecking, by extending them to address this challenge.",
