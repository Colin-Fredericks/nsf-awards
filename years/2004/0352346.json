 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports development of a novel, time-resolved fluorescence (luminescence) flatbed scanner designed for highly sensitive detection of individual proteins following separation on electrophoresis gels or after binding to protein microarrays.  Such gels and microarrays are important analytical tools for modern biological research, but are limited by the need to use radioactive labeling for detection of small amounts of protein.  While staining or non-radioactive labeling can be used for proteins in larger amounts, the use of fluorescent labels can be hampered by background fluorescence.  This problem can be avoided by use of lanthanide complexes as the labeling agent.  The long-lived fluorescence, or luminescence, of lanthanide complexes permits measurements to be made after the background fluorescence, which is short-lived, has decayed.  A time-resolved detector is required for such measurements.  The proposed instrument, which will be built by modifying a commercial flatbed optical scanner, is expected to be inexpensive, putting it within reach of researchers and educators in a variety of areas.  Currently, there are no similar instruments available with time-resolved capability, preventing scientists from taking full advantage of the luminescence properties of lanthanide complexes.  Both undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the development of the scanner and, in the process, be exposed to advanced proteomics problems.  The combination of a moderate price with the sensitive detection of the proposed instrument will permit the spread of this instrument, and the corresponding luminescent lanthanide reagents, to a broad range of life scientists.",
