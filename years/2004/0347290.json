 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lewis, Christopher\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvia\r\nCCF-0347290\r\n\r\nParallel programs are notoriously difficult to write and growing\r\napplication requirements (e.g, ease of development, reliability,\r\nsecurity, etc.) are only exacerbating the problem.  Ad hoc dynamic\r\ntechniques that observe, limit, or otherwise control running\r\napplications (e.g., array bounds checks, assertions, bug isolation) have\r\nhelped satisfy some of these requirements in sequential programs, but\r\nperformance overhead and implementation challenges have limited their\r\ngeneral utility.  This research develops and evaluates\r\nsupplement-oriented programming as a programming paradigm for\r\nconveniently and efficiently enhancing parallel systems with dynamic\r\nchecks and monitors.  Supplement-oriented programming is a style of\r\nprogramming in which abstract computations (called supplements)\r\nimplement supplemental behaviors that are added to a running application\r\nin order to dynamically observe, limit, or control it without changing\r\nits core functional behavior.  Supplement-oriented programming\r\ntransforms the use of supplemental behaviors from an awkward, ad hoc art\r\nto a well-supported programming paradigm.  The logical separation of\r\nfunctional and supplemental behaviors allows for simpler\r\nsupplement-enabled programs, plug-and-play supplement libraries,\r\nlanguage and tool-based support, and (ultimately) higher quality, easier\r\nto build parallel programs.  This work also explores novel\r\nimplementation techniques, such as backfill processing, that efficiently\r\nimplement supplements using the often underutilized parallel resources\r\nof typical systems.\r\n\r\nSupplement-oriented programming is an enabling technology.  It will not\r\nonly improve the robustness of parallel software, it will allow people\r\nwith broader abilities, interests, and backgrounds to use parallel\r\nsystems, magnifying their creative power so that they may find new and\r\nimportant uses for these machines.\r\n\r\n",
