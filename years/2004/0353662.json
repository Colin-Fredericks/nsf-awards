 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry Education Program supports the continuation of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Harvey Mudd College (HMC).  Shenda Baker is the site's Program Director. Eight HMC faculty will serve as REU student mentors. Eight students will be supported for a ten-weak research program. Additional students will be supported by institutional funds and faculty research grants. The REU site at Harvey Mudd focuses on recruiting female undergraduate students interested in careers in chemistry. The research projects offered are in the areas of analytical, biological, inorganic, organic, physical, and theoretical chemistry. Summer research activities will be supplemented with workshops on careers in chemistry and scientific ethics, seminars, and a plant tour to an operating chemical facility.  Program assessment will include tracking the students' major upon graduation, publications, career path and eventual degree obtained. An anonymous program evaluation form will also be used to provide feedback on ways to improve the students' summer research experience. This REU site also provides extensive training in technical communication to both scientists and non-scientists.",
