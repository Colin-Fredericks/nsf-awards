 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Project summary \r\nThe physics of hadron excitations, such as the N* resonances, hybrid mesons and baryons \r\nin which the valence quarks are bound by an excited gluon ?eld, glueballs, doubly-charmed \r\nbaryons, and the recently-discovered pentaquark systems, will be studied using computer simulations \r\nof quarks and gluons on a space-time lattice. Such systems should provide a wealth of \r\ninformation to help us understand the physics of con?nement and hadron formation in quantum \r\nchromodynamics, the theory of the strong interactions and one of the fundamental forces of \r\nNature. These states are also currently of great interest to experimentalists, exempli?ed by the \r\nHall B N* program and the GlueX experiment in the proposed Hall D at the Thomas Je?erson \r\nNational Accelerator Facility, as well as the CLEO-c project at Cornell. Understanding the \r\nphysics of con?ning gluons is an important intellectual challenge; in fact, it is one of the seven \r\nso-called Millenium Prize problems announced by the Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, \r\nMassachusetts. \r\nOne of the most reliable means of investigating such systems is using computer simulations \r\nof quarks and gluons on a space-time lattice. Until recently, these states were di?cult to simulate \r\nand hence, received little attention. Advances in lattice simulation technology (the use of \r\nbetter gauge and fermion actions on anisotropic lattices, the application of variational techniques \r\nwith large correlation matrices, constrained curve ?tting using Bayesian priors) and computing \r\ntechnology (clusters, dramatically faster processors) make it possible not only to determine the \r\nspectra of such excitations, but also to probe their internal structures for the ?rst time. Commodity \r\ncomputing clusters at Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Maryland at College \r\nPark, the University of California at San Diego, and Je?erson Laboratory will be used to carry \r\nout these simulations. \r\nA major objective of this proposal is to calculate the mass spectrum of light-quark hybrid \r\nmesons and baryons, the N* excitations, doubly-charmed baryons, and pentaquark states using \r\nMonte Carlo methods with large sets of well-designed operators. Another key goal is to study the \r\nexcitation spectrum and structures of the stationary states of gluons in the presence of a static \r\nquark-antiquark pair and three static quarks. The proposal also includes plans to determine the \r\nspatial sizes and internal structures of the low-lying pure-gauge glueballs, and to test various \r\nmodels of con?nement using the glueball spectrum. \r\nThe proposed research incorporates the participation of three graduate students, and possibly \r\none or more undergraduate students, whose educations will be enhanced not only by involvement \r\nin scienti?c projects at the forefront of nuclear theory, but also with high-technology \r\ntraining in the use of state-of-the-art parallel computing resources. The broader impacts of the \r\nproposed activities will be strengthened by posting results with simpli?ed background information \r\non publicly accessible web pages.\r\n",
