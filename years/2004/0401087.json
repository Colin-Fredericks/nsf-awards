 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the project is to develop and test wavelength-selective widely tunable (1250-1650 nm) resonant microcavity filters and switches by on-chip electrostatic micro-electro-mechanical actuation of indium phosphide (InP) waveguides and highly reflective monolithic horizontal mirrors, for broadband optical networks. The work builds upon experimental research initiated by the PI to establish InP as a suitable material for micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems (MOEMS), permitting a new level of monolithic integration of active and passive optoelectronic devices, impossible in traditional silicon-based MEMS.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merits:\r\n MEMS provide a simple and useful broad wavelength-tuning mechanism, often superior to the corresponding static configuration, by realizing variable-length microcavities bound by two highly reflective mirrors in waveguide-based low-power Photonic Integrated Circuits (PIC).\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nIntegrated MOEMS devices are inherently miniaturized and mass-producible; a fact that helps in accelerating the penetration of intelligent optical networks closer to the consumers for faster and easier access to information, leading to sweeping impact in all fields including education, healthcare, and commerce. The integration of e-beam-lithographically defined deep-etched sub-micron composite mirror structures would boost the integration of MEMS with nanotechnology. The proposed research will strengthen an ongoing InP-based Optical MEMS program in the PI's group. The PI supervises a number of undergraduate and graduate students, majority of whom are US citizens. MSAL has also hosted international exchange students and senior research scientists for short-term collaborative research projects. The co-PI is a member of the Women in Engineering program at the UMD, and regularly mentors students of all levels (from middle school to graduate school). These activities will directly impact the nature of system integration curriculum development at UMD, recruitment of outstanding students (already evident), creation of internship opportunities for students in industry, and dissemination of knowledge to a much larger community through the regional MEMS Alliance workshops and eventually, refereed journal publications.\r\n",
