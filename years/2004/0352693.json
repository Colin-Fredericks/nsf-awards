 "awd_abstract_narration": "This institute will be operated under the auspices of the Department of Mathematical Sciences and the Center for Nonlinear Analysis at Carnegie Mellon University. The institute is a seven-week summer program for\r\nundergraduate students. Minority and female students are targeted for recruitment into the institute. The primary goal of the institute is to prepare students for and interest them in pursuing graduate work in applied mathematics. Secondary goals are to acquaint students with modern application areas of mathematics and to give them some understanding of the work involved in studying in these areas at the graduate level. The\r\ninstitute has operated successfully since 1994 under this format.\r\n\r\nUS citizens this year constitute a minority among Mathematics doctoral recipients, continuing a long-term downward trend. Numbers of women among these are low and the numbers for African-Americans and Hispanics and Latinos are extremely low compared to population numbers. Programs such as this may serve to help enhance these numbers by attracting more students into graduate programs.",
