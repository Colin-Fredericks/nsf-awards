 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nFunding is requested to help offset travel expenses for undergraduate and graduate\r\nstudents attending the 24th Annual Crown Gall Conference. This conference will take place\r\nNovember 22-23, 2003 at Cornell University, and will be attended by approximately 75\r\nnational and international scientists that study Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Of these,\r\napproximately half will be students working in US labs, who will be the sole beneficiaries\r\nof financial assistance from NSF. Several of these students study at undergraduate\r\ncolleges, and their advisors do not have adequate funding for travel of this sort.\r\nStudies of A. tumefaciens continue to provide an ongoing intellectual feast. This\r\norganism is one of the best developed model pathogens available. It provided the first\r\nmodel for translocation of macromolecules from pathogen to host, a phenomenon that is now\r\nknown to be quite widespread. The A. tumefaciens transfer system continues to be the best\r\ncharacterized member of its family. This bacterium provided the first model for the\r\ndetection of host-released diffusible chemical signals, and this system continues to lead\r\nthe way in host detection. This organism has also provided an excellent model for the\r\nphenomenon of cell-cell communication, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as quorum\r\nsensing. Students of A. tumefaciens will continue to provide leadership in fundamental\r\naspects of host-microbe interactions. This conference therefore focuses on an important\r\nmodel patho-system.\r\nThese studies also impact the scientific infrastructure in many ways. One area has to do\r\nwith the creation of transgenic plants. Although A. tumefaciens is routinely used to\r\nintroduce transgenes into many species of plants, there is a great deal of room for\r\nimprovement, particularly in transformation of monocots, the introduction of extremely\r\nlong T-DNAs, in the regeneration of plants from transformed cells, and in the removal of\r\nantibiotic resistance markers from transgenic crops. The fundamental studies presenting\r\nin this conference will surely impact upon plant molecular genetics and agriculture.\r\nA. tumefaciens also provides an excellent model for learning how to do good science. The\r\norganism is readily culturable and readily manipulated genetically. Therefore, this\r\norganism and its hosts provide many opportunities for learning how to do highly\r\ncontrolled, reproducible, hypothesis-based experiments. In short, students of A.\r\ntumefaciens learn how to be good scientists, and will carry these skills with them\r\nthroughout their scientific careers.",
