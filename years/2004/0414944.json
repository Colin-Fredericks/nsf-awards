 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose the  development of a  variable temperature, variable magnetic field ultrahigh  vacuum  scanning  force  microscope  that enables the local measurement of frictional, magnetostatic, and electrostatic forces as a function of  temperature  (10  K <  T <  300  K)  and magnetic field (B < 0.1 T). The new instrument will combine well-tested  elements  together  with  new design  elements  that  have  not  been  applied  to SFM before. The attributes of extremely high resolution and stability, ultrahigh vacuum with in-situ tip and sample preparation, flexibility in temperature from 10 K to room temperature, and magnetic fields up to more than 0.1 T would be unique in the US.  Friction has been explored at the nanoscale in the past as a function of the applied load or the sliding velocity, but very little has been  done  as  a  function  of  the temperature due to a lack of suitable equipment. Such experiments will be useful to test current theoretical models of friction, which describe friction as a thermally activated process. To address these questions, we  will  investigate  friction  as  a  function  of  the  temperature,  and also measure friction at phase transitions in order to separate phononic and electronic contributions to friction. In this project, we will carry out local imaging of the phase separation between ferromagnetic metallic and charge-ordered insulating clusters that coexist in colossal magnetoresistive (CMR) manganites using electrostatic force microscopy and magnetic force  microscopy  at  variable  temperatures  and  magnetic  fields.  We  will  also  examine  the  low field manipulation of phase percolation of epitaxial ferroelectric/CMR heterostructures using an electric  field  effect  approach.  In this experiment, we will look to induce metallic conduction at low magnetic fields (hundreds of gauss) by applying small voltages (a few volts). \r\n%%%\r\nWe propose the  development of a  variable temperature, variable magnetic field ultrahigh  vacuum  scanning  force  microscope  that enables the local measurement of frictional, magnetostatic, and electrostatic forces as a function of  temperature  and magnetic field.
