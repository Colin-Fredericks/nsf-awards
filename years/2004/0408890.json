 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences Minority Post-Doctoral Research and Training Fellowship is a comparative examination of the cultural and economic impacts and implications of recent innovations in computer technologies on youths and young adults in Salvador (Bahia, Brazil) and New York City.  Using a combination of ethnographic, historical, and discursive approaches to examine differences  between  Brazilian  and  American  perceptions  and  uses  of  digital  sampling  and  computer networking technologies in music making practices, the researcher will explore how differences in culture and  access  to  computers  inform  the  ways  technologies  are  viewed  and  appropriated,  and  how technologies and music participate in the rearticulation of cultural boundaries. A better understanding of the complexities of cross-cultural differences in access to and use of computer technologies is essential for  the  development  of  more  appropriate  discussions,  initiatives,  and  policies  aimed  at  minimizing  the role of technologies as agents of social exclusion.   Music  technologies  provide  a  particularly  apt  vehicle  for  developing  a  more  nuanced understanding  of  the  cultural  impacts  and  implications  of  globalizing  technologies.  Music  is  both formative  and  indicative  of  cultural  and  political  identity  among  youths  and  young  adults,  the  groups most engaged with computer and computer-networking technologies.  Music also plays a primary role in shaping  perceptions  of  other  cultures,  serving  as  a  means  to  both  reproduce  and  transcend  cultural boundaries and prejudices. With recent innovations in computer and computer networking technologies, music has become one of the most salient, mobile, and widely circulated forms of cultural exchange, thus, reinforcing its role as a prime mediator of cross-cultural perceptions.   \r\nRecent innovations in computer and computer-networking technologies have profoundly altered the  way music  is  produced  in  several  ways:  (1)  It  is  possible  to  cheaply  produce  professional-quality music  with  home  computers;  (2)  Computer-based  digital  sampling  technologies  have  blurred  the conventional lines between musical production and consumption, allowing composers to appropriate and re-contextualize  any  existing  sound  source  (both  foreign  and  domestic);  (3)  Internet  technologies have  allowed  for  the  development  of  transnational  computer  music  technology  fora  through  which geographically-dispersed  communities  exchange  technical  knowledge  and  circulate music  and  software for  music  production.  Together, the relative ease and lower costs  of music  production,  the  increased accessibility of and use of preexisting sounds in music production, and the increased role of transnational communication  and  exchange  in  mediating  the  use  of  technology  have  fostered  the  emergence  of  subcultures  oriented  around  novel  musical  forms  that  synthesize  disparate  cultural  elements.  Included among  these,  are  culturally hybrid musics  that  employ  digital  sampling  technologies  to  synthesize North American and European urban dance music with traditional Brazilian musical elements. This study argues that musicians in Salvador and New York City view themselves as participating in  a  cosmopolitan  technoculture  forged  around  computer  music  technologies  and  culturally  hybrid musics.  Despite this shared  participation  in  social  processes,  different  cultural,  linguistic,  political, economic, and technological contexts yield disparate ways in which people symbolically and practically engage  in  this  community  and  in  the  technologies  and  music  around  which  it  is  oriented.   Although Brazilian sampling practices can often bear similar meanings to those of North American artists, the uses of computer music technologies have distinct meanings that address, react to, and seek to transform local contexts. These contexts not only inform the meanings of samples and sampling, but the particular ways in which technological tools are used to manipulate sounds. This study argues that the different ways in which  technologies  and  music  are  appropriated  and  re-contextualized,  are  indicative  and  formative  of perceived cultural differences and changing relations between Brazilian and American youth.   Extensive interviews will be conducted with computer music technology users to understand the different ways  in which  computer  technologies  are  socialized and their role in mediating  interviewees' relationships to music and other cultures. \r\n\r\n",
