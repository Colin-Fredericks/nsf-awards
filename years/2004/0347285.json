 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Distributed Coordination Strategies for Mobile Autonomous Agents\r\n\r\nDepartment of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania\r\nThis proposal is aimed at developing tools for analysis and design of distributed algorithms for co-ordination\r\nof groups of mobile autonomous agents. Such coordination algorithms have appeared in\r\nvarious disciplines in different contexts, ranging from biological sciences (aggregation and social\r\ncohesion in animal species) to systems and control theory and collective robotics (cooperative con-trol\r\nof multi-vehicle systems), and from statistical physics (non-equilibrium phenomena in many\r\ndegree-of-freedom dynamical systems) to computer graphics (artificial life, simulated flocking).\r\nWe plan to develop a unified theory which provides a provably correct analysis and synthesis of\r\ndistributed coordination and collective synchronization among a network of mobile agents with a\r\nchanging topology. Several key problems are formulated and road-maps for obtaining efficient and\r\nscalable solutions to the problems are discussed. The proposed research plan utilizes tools from\r\nalgebraic and spectral theory of graphs, control theory and theory of dynamical systems.\r\nIntellectual Merit: Distributed coordination problems such as collective synchronization and\r\nflocking are ubiquitous in complex biological, engineering, and physical systems. Such prob-lems\r\narise in control theory, physics, biology, social sciences, power system networks and in time\r\nsynchronization in sensor networks. The common feature of all of the above problems is that a set\r\nof (possibly mobile) agents are interconnected using simple nearest neighbor rules in a network\r\nwith a topology that is time varying. We plan to develop a unified framework which allows us\r\nto study these problems and synthesize coordinated and cooperative systems of multiple agents.\r\nMoreover, this study will provide a justification for the so called emergence of collective behavior\r\nfrom simple local interactions, a phenomenon which has been observed across complex engineer-ing\r\nand natural systems.\r\nBroader Impacts: The proposed research will impact the study of complex engineering systems,\r\nranging from operation and joint coordination of unmanned air, ground, and underwater vehicles\r\nas well as coordination of a network of unmanned robots to perform search and rescue operations.\r\nThe research will also impact other emerging applications in homeland security, defense, trans-portation,\r\nwireless communication, and electric power networks, which require networks of agents\r\nto be capable of multi-user communication, collaborative information processing, and distributed\r\ncomputation, actuation, and control. The research plan is also accompanied by an active educa-tion\r\nplan consisting of undergraduate and graduate level course development, which will provide a\r\nframework for studying problems involving dynamic systems over networks. The plan is designed\r\nto involve undergraduate students in research and provide them with a well-defined plan of study\r\nto help motivate them to pursue an advanced degree. It would also bring research across several\r\nareas of science and systems theory together in a single unifying framework.",
