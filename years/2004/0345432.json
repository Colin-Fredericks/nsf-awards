 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Janis Louie is exploring new transition metal catalyzed routes for the  use of carbon dioxide as a reagent in organic synthesis. Mechanistic details of the nickel catalyzed [2+2+2] cycloaddition of diynes with carbon dioxide will be elucidated, providing input for the design and synthesis of second generation catalysts with higher reactivities and expanded substrate scope. Cycloaddition regioselectivity will be evaluated with a variety of differentially substituted asymmetric diynes, and the general methodology will be applied to the synthesis of a representative pyrone natural product, tetillapyrone. Professor Louie will develop an undergraduate honors organic chemistry program, designed to enhance the quality of the undergraduate experience for highly motivated students, and will also implement an outreach program within the University of Utah's ACCESS program, enhancing the opportunities afforded young women scientists through this scholarship and mentoring program.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the teaching and research program of Professor Janis Louie, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah. Professor Louie is developing novel methods for using carbon dioxide, an inexpensive, safe (except with respect to its role as a greenhouse gas) and abundantly available compound, for the synthesis of complex organic molecules. Her studies are leading to the development of unique reaction chemistry that will be of general applicability in the construction of organic molecules displaying important chemical or biological properties. Professor Louie is also developing an undergraduate honors organic chemistry program, designed to enhance the quality of the undergraduate experience for highly motivated students, and will also implement an outreach program within the University of Utah's ACCESS program, enhancing the opportunities afforded young women scientists through this scholarship and mentoring program.",
