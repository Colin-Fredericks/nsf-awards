 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the acquisition of confocal fluorescence microscope.  This sophisticated microscope uses laser illumination and computer analysis to produce three-dimensional images of microscopic specimens, including live cells.  It will be used as a research tool by at least five different investigators in at least three academic departments. The microscope will constitute a significant addition to the infrastructure supporting both faculty and undergraduate research in the life sciences at the College. Using it, members of the Biology Department will identify the location of specific molecules in living cells from both vertebrates and invertebrates.  Others will be able to investigate the formation of the nuclear membrane in test tube extracts from fertilized sea urchin eggs. In the Neuroscience Department, the microscope will make it possible to investigate specific neural circuits in the brainstem. The instrument will be used in environmental research to visualize bacterial communities from sedimentary basins.  In addition to enhancing research programs, the confocal fluorescence microscope will be used by at least 10 senior honors students as part of their independent research projects each year, and will contribute to the work of at least 5 rising sophomores and juniors in intensive research experiences on campus each summer. This program has played a key role in efforts to engage and retain students from traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences, and represents one of several institution wide strategies to address the \"leaky\" educational pipeline for women and minorities interested in careers in the sciences. The confocal fluorescence microscope will also enable faculty to supplement life sciences and environmental science curriculum with new laboratory experiments and modules that will expose a wider group of undergraduates to an instrument they are likely to encounter in graduate programs in the life sciences.",
