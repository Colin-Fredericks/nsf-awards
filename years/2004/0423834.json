 "awd_abstract_narration": "Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) were among the first animals to fly, and their wings are unique.  Their distribution is world-wide, yet many taxa are environmentally confined, making them valuable indicators of areas of priority for conservation.  We will analyze evolutionary relationships among as many subfamilies of Odonata as possible, as a foundation for biological work on the group. We will collect DNA sequence data from 28S rRNA, EF-1alpha, and mitochondrial genes as well as morphology. Data will be analyzed using parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. The project will integrate a variety of differing backgrounds among its participants. Kjer's expertise is in molecular phylogenetics, and seeks to utilize the expertise of morphological systematists and introduce them to molecular methods.  Frank Carle is an organismal odonatologist, stressing the value of concordance between independent morphological characters.  May has experience studying the ecology and behavior of Odonata. \r\n\r\nThe study will train an African-American doctoral student, Jessica Ware, and a postdoctoral associate.  In addition to her scientific training, Ms. Ware is actively working in the Newark and Camden School systems to help recruit students from groups historically underrepresented in science to attend Rutgers. Like dinosaurs and birds, dragonflies and their evolutionary history appeal to the public.  This phylogeny will provide a framework for discussing these organisms with the public and give us an example of what the first animal on earth to fly might have looked like.  As integral components of freshwater ecosystems, Odonata are important as indicators of water quality.\r\n",
