Mackay\r\nInstitution:\t\t\tMichigan State University\r\n\r\nIn this project, the flow and physical properties of a suspension or slurry is being \r\ninvestigated. However, the particles are smaller than the fluids molecules in which they \r\nare dispersed and this produces unusual effects. We have found that nanoparticles with a \r\nsize of order 5-10 nm suspended in a polymeric liquid with molecules of size 15-40 nm \r\nproduce a liquid that has a viscosity lower than the neat polymeric liquid itself. A \r\nviscosity reduction is at odds with Einsteins century old prediction that Brownian \r\nparticles increase the viscosity of liquids. Indeed all observations suggest that a viscosity \r\nincrease is always present in particulate suspensions. A recent publication on this effect is \r\nin press in the journal Nature Materials. \r\n\r\nSince the particles are so small it is believed they influence the dynamics of the \r\npolymeric liquid on a local scale. The nanoparticles apparently increase the free volume \r\nin the polymeric liquid as well as confine the polymer molecules to produce the viscosity \r\ndecrease. Further, contemporary methods to quantify entanglements suggest no change in \r\nthe entanglement density. It is the purpose of this work to further elucidate the \r\nphenomenon and resolve this quandary. \r\n\r\nA recent discovery, included in the preliminary results, is that very chemically \r\ndifferent nanoparticle (polyethylene). polymer (polystyrene) systems can be molecularly \r\ndispersed as long as the particle is smaller than the polymer. The polyethylene. \r\npolystyrene system is a model phase separating system and it has been discovered that \r\nchanging the molecular topology of one component into a particle-like conformation \r\naffects its solubility and stability in a polymeric liquid. This is a unique result, not fully \r\nunderstood at present and represents one aspect of the proposed research. This could \r\ncreate a new class of molecular alloys. Further research will be conducted with \r\nfullerenes, as a model system whose size is much smaller than available nanoparticles, \r\nand single wall carbon nanotubes, as a model system to introduce a new particulate \r\ngeometry. These systems will be utilized to generalize the viscosity reduction effect. \r\nWe will use a variety of techniques in the proposed work to measure the dispersion \r\nof the nanoparticles as well the state of the suspending fluids. chain-like molecules. \r\nThese techniques include: rheological characterization, thermal analysis, mechanical \r\ntesting, electron optics evaluation and small angle neutron scattering. All this \r\ninstrumentation exists in the group, is on campus or is available at Argonne National \r\nLaboratory. Graduate and undergraduate students in the research group will be exposed \r\nto these results and in some cases will gather results together as we have done when \r\nperforming neutron scattering. There are three females and three males in the research \r\ngroup and through teamwork participation of an underrepresented group will broaden \r\ntheir learning experience. \r\n\r\nDissemination of these results will be presented through the scientific literature and \r\nconferences as well as through undergraduate and graduate level lectures. The principal \r\ninvestigator sets aside one lecture every semester in the introductory (sophomore) course \r\nhe teaches to introduce his research to the students. This lecture is well received and \r\ngives students an introduction to the research process as well as the results of research. \r\nThe proposed research is unique and is at odds to contemporary observations. Inclusion \r\nof this topic in the research lecture will demonstrate how science and engineering is \r\ncontinuously evolving and not stagnant. Many underrepresented students attend this \r\nlecture and immediately after, as well as for many months thereafter, they show interest \r\nin research and wish to undertake research with the principal investigator or other \r\nprofessors. \r\n",
