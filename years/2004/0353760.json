The objective of the SURAP REU program is to offer undergraduates across the nation its tutorial program in astronomical research.  Specific goals include:\r\nIntroducing undergraduates to a realistic and fulfilling experience in astrophysics research, including current concerns about science ethics.\r\n\r\nAcquainting undergraduates with the diverse research fields in modern astrophysics, and provide opportunities to work directly with active professionals.  The students will be given the responsibility to become independent, creative researchers.\r\nOffering undergraduates valuable observing experience.\r\nPlacing undergraduates in a socially diverse environment with student colleagues from diverse cultural, geographical and educational backgrounds.\r\nEncouraging undergraduates to disseminate their research results in publications and at professional meetings.\r\nExposing undergraduates to a wide variety of additional scientific and outdoor endeavors unique to the Wyoming and Rocky Mountain region.\r\n\r\nIn each of the five years of the grant, seven undergraduate students will be chosen from colleges and universities throughout the nation.  Special emphasis will be placed on meeting the SURAP goal of selecting students from diverse backgrounds by concentrating on freshman and sophomore undergraduates, women and under-represented minority students from liberal arts colleges and small universities with limited research facilities. A concurrent academic/laboratory course and research seminar will be undertaken, as will dedicated seminars designed to address issues related to science ethics.  A Research Experience for Teachers (RET) component will also be included, which will allow two K-12 teachers to participate fully in the research activities.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is co-funded by the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, and the Division of Ethics and Values Studies in the Social, Behavioral and Economical Sciences Directorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
