 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is awarding thirty scholarships per year for four years to students enrolled in a computer, electronic engineering or civil engineering technologies associate degree program. The project is supporting the Scholars with peer and faculty mentoring, engaging them in an active student chapter of the Association of Information Technology, providing child care for students with children at a child development center, supporting their academic progress in academic achievement centers, and developing partnerships and support systems with technology employers within their own discipline. The project is building upon the lessons learned from a previously awarded CSEMS project. Previous recipients, who are working in industry, are becoming role models by giving presentations and supporting current CSEMS recipients. \r\n\r\nDepartmental faculty within each of the three programs are providing an identification and referral process to improve retention, graduation and transfer rates of the scholars. Recruitment and retention efforts are specifically targeting underrepresented and non-traditional students through a federally funded Educational Talent Search program, TRIO programs that include an Upward Bound program, and a Program for Accelerated College Enrollment. \r\n",
