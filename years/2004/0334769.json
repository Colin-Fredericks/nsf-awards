The project is directed by Edward Saff at Vanderbilt University's Center for Constructive Approximation and Laurent Baratchart at INRIA-Sophia-Antipolis.  An average of three Vanderbilt graduate students per year will spend five months in team research at INRIA and INRIA graduate students and/or postdoctoral fellows will be hosted by the Department of Mathematics at Vanderbilt, where they will cooperate with researchers and attend graduate level mathematics courses.  Research topics include:  (1) scientific computing, modeling and numerical analysis; (2) modeling and control of renewable resources; (3) medical imaging and robotics; (4) geometry, algebra, algorithms, and mathematics; and (5) computing in automatic control and optimization.  The benefits are increased international visibility for research activities at Vanderbilt,  increased opportunities for U.S. students to participate in international research and to establish cooperative research links.\r\n\r\nThe National Science Foundation will cover the costs of the visits by U.S. graduate students to INRIA and INRIA will provide support to French graduates and postdoctoral researchers for their visits to Vanderbilt University.\r\n",
