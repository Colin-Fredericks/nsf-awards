 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Distributed Quantum Information Project will explore quantum architectures that allow for distributed quantum resources, i.e. a network of quantum nodes connected with quantum channels. The project centers on the realization of a Matter-light interconnect with Cavity QED where neutral atoms and ensembles of atoms will provide the quantum nodes and qubits while the quantum channel will be done by optical means or a quantum bus of coherently transported atoms. This quantum network architecture will allow the generation of entanglement between atoms and photons, and entanglement between distant nodes, a critical part of the interface necessary for quantum computing . Investigations of quantum coherence and entanglement over macroscopic distances will also enhance our understanding of the sources of decoherence and their effects on the fidelity of the transmitted information, and the effects of quantum measurement, quantum feedback, and back-action. The prototype quantum bus will include quantum control in its operation, an innovative approach in quantum computing (dmc). \r\n\r\nThis research effort is a collaboration between experimentalists and theorists, and between academic and government scientists. Graduate students and post-doctoral associates will be trained in quantum information science through the establishment of information science pre- and post-doctoral fellowships. The proposed in-house rotation and world-wide scientist exchange program will not only give Fellows exposure to all aspects of the field and valuable interaction with world leaders, it will also ensure a constant infusion of new ideas. Special forums for undergraduate students will be held in the evenings during the academic year and research projects will be arranged for them in the summer. Participating students will be recruited not only from existing programs, but from the rich source of Historically Black Colleges and Universities in Maryland, Washington, DC and Virginia. A dynamic web page, an active seminar series and an annual open house will be key channels through which we will disseminate our findings to both the scientific and non-technical communities.\r\n\r\nFunding for this project is provided by the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and by the Division of Computing and Communication Foundations in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.  \r\n",
