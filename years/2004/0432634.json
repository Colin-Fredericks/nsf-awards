 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Householder Symposium gathers the world's most active researchers in numerical linear algebra once every three years to review advances in the field,  present recent theoretical and practical results, assess where the field is headed in the near future, and to provide an intimate atmosphere to foster close personal  interaction and exchange of ideas.  Key subjects that will be emphasized at the symposium include the solution of large systems of linear equations, eigenvalue problems, preconditioning, perturbation theory, least squares, integral equations, and applications in many  different aspects of scientific and engineering computation,  including control, systems and signal processing, data-mining,  data compression, and bio-engineering. Many reseachers in numerical linear algebra consider the Householder Symposium to be the most important and influential meeting in the field.\r\n\r\nThis project supports the travel of junior U.S. researchers to the 16th Householder Symposium  on Numerical Linear Algebra to be held May 23--27, 2005  in Champion, Pennsylvania.  The funds are for travel expenses  for U.S. graduate students and recent Ph.D.s who would otherwise  be unable to attend.  The NSF funds will permit full participation by the most promising junior members of the  U.S. numerical linear algebra community.  As the Householder Symposium is traditionally a gateway conference into the field, participation of junior scientists is essential. U.S. participation in the Symposium will have a positive impact on the  continued strong competitiveness of the U.S. in the crucial discipline  of numerical linear algebra. Advances in numerical linear algebra have had an  enormous impact on a number of scientific fields that are important in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in science and technology. Some recent examples  include the development of web search engines such as those for Google and Yahoo, algorithms used in the development of the global positioning system, eigenvalue based algorithms for face recognition that can be used in airport security, and the development of algorithms for high speed supercomputers.",
