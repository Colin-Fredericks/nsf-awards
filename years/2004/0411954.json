 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves laboratory studies of processes related to acid and salt dissolution in atmospherically relevant aqueous systems, namely cloud droplets, hydrated aerosols, and ice crystals.  The activities include detailed studies of the solvation of acids and salts, qualifying the influence of acids on the partitioning of halides between the condensed and gas phases, and examination of ion-induced nucleation.  All of these activities have significant current relevance as there is need for increased fundamental understanding of aerosol-gas interactions and the possible role of halogens in tropospheric chemistry.  In addition, speculations on the possible importance of ion-induced nucleation have been published, but the basic thermochemical data needed to assess it quantitatively are lacking.  This study seeks to address current gaps in our understanding in these areas.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of this project include providing high quality training of graduate students in these important and topical research areas.  In addition, the results of this work are likely to significantly impact understanding of basic aerosol-related processes, thus leading to improved numerical models, and likely better ability to predict changes in related atmospheric processes due to global changes.",
