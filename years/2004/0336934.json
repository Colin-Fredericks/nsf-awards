 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: Rural Alliance for Improving Science Education (RAISE) \r\nInstitution: Oklahoma State University \r\nPI/Co-PIs:  Thomas A. Wikle (PI), Joel W. Helmer and John E. Steinbrink (Co-PIs) \r\nFellow/Year: 10 (graduate) \r\nSchool Partners: Perkins/Tryon, Morrison, and Hennessey Public Schools \r\nTarget:  6 through 12th grades \r\nSetting:  rural \r\nDisciplines:  interdisciplinary (Earth sciences, life sciences, general sciences) \r\n \r\nBackground:  Despite recent implementation of statewide science education standards, \r\nstudents from rural Oklahoma communities lag behind the nation in math and science \r\nability.  Compounding the problem is a shortage of math and science teachers making it \r\nnecessary for teachers to offer subjects outside of their primary science teaching area.   \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit of the Proposed Activity:  The Rural Alliance for Improving Science \r\nEducation (RAISE) places outstanding graduate students (fellows) in 6-12 grade \r\nclassrooms to work one-on-one with public school teachers in three rural school districts.  \r\nSupervised by a committee of science teachers and faculty from Oklahoma State \r\nUniversity (OSU), RAISE builds on existing relationships among OSU faculty and K-\r\n12 teachers established through POLARIS, a Department of Education sponsored project \r\nfor improving middle and junior high science instruction.  The interdisciplinary area of \r\nGeographic Information Science (GISci) serves as the focus for the development of \r\ninnovative science curricula with the goals of:  1) strengthening curricular ties among \r\necology, biology, Earth science and environmental science, and 2) providing measurable \r\nimprovement in student performance on state-mandated science tests.    \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts of the Proposed Activity:  RAISE targets rural school districts with \r\nsignificant numbers of Native American students and high poverty rates.  Fellows from \r\nthe Departments of Botany, Zoology, Microbiology, Geography, Geology, and \r\nEnvironmental Science are completing their OSU degree with stronger communication \r\nskills, an improved understanding of science pedagogy, and a greater appreciation for the \r\nneeds of both teachers and diverse learners.  Lesson plans and other materials developed \r\nby fellow/teacher teams will be disseminated regionally through summer institutes and \r\nnationally through a project web site promoted via science education journals and teacher \r\nconferences.  The principal benchmarks for project success are:  1) student \r\nimprovement on science sections of the state-mandated Oklahoma Core Curriculum Test \r\nand, 2) the number of teachers/schools throughout the state and nation that integrate \r\nRAISE materials into 6-10th grade science instruction. \r\n",
