 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program in the Division of Chemistry makes this Career award to Northwestern University to investigate the synthesis and properties of nanoscale transition metal dichalcogenide materials.  With this award, Professor Teri Odom will explore routes to inorganic, fullerene-like MX2 (M = Nb, Ta; X = S, Se) materials and strategies for varying the electronic properties through control of size, structure and intercalation chemistry.  Of primary interest is how the surface and bulk structure and finite size of a system can influence the properties of collective phenomena, such as charge density waves and superconductivity.  Variable temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and conducting atomic force microscopy (AFM) will be used for electronic characterization.  Professor Odom will also integrate nanoscale technology into classroom activities and enable participation of high school science teachers in research projects.  She is developing curriculum in nanoscience that includes access to cutting-edge instrumentation and early exposure of undergraduate students to research.   \r\n\r\nProfessor Teri Odom will develop methods for the preparation of fullerene-like, nanoscale materials based on transition metal dichalcogenide compounds and investigate the electronic properties through the use of atomic and high spectroscopic resolution techniques.  The results of these studies provide fundamental information about materials properties that control superconductivity and electronic charge trapping by surface states.  The education component will broaden awareness of research and nanoscale science and open new learning opportunities for high school science teachers.\r\n",
