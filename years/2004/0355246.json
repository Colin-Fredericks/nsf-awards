 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the early years of their development, federal cybersecurity initiatives have primarily targeted four-year colleges and universities, largely ignoring two-year colleges. Yet, two-year colleges educate 44% of U.S. undergraduates and serve millions of high school students. Furthermore, they provide continuing education and skill-upgrading opportunities to a large percentage of America's workforce.\r\n\r\nThis ATE Regional Center of Excellence addresses the need to build viable programs at two-year colleges. It incorporates six key entities: Oklahoma's Career and Technology Education (CareerTech) System; four of Oklahoma's largest two-year colleges (Oklahoma City Community College, Oklahoma State University-Okmulgee, Rose State College, and Tulsa Community College); and the University of Tulsa, an NSA-designated national faculty development center, which serves as the principal training provider and mentor to the two-year institutions. These six entities cover almost 60% of Oklahoma's population and more than 70% of its IT workforce. By leveraging partnerships with other universities and two-year colleges, the center aims to provide education and training opportunities throughout Oklahoma and in major population centers in neighboring states.\r\n\r\nThe center is developing and disseminating information assurance and forensics curricula to two-year colleges, both regionally and nationally; offering professional development opportunities to instructors from two-year colleges and assisting them in building programs at their own institutions; and designing and implementing workforce development programs in information assurance and forensics, which contribute to economic development and the national homeland security effort.\r\n\r\nThe center's curriculum has five core areas: (1) information assurance, (2) secure electronic commerce, (3) network security, (4) enterprise security management, and (5) forensics. This curriculum covers the breadth of the discipline, including its technical, operational, and managerial dimensions, and related legal and ethical issues. The curriculum and its intense laboratory component have been incorporated into associate degree and certificate programs in cybersecurity and are mapped to industry (Cisco, Microsoft) and vendor-neutral (CompTIA, SCP, CIW) certifications and federal (CNSS) standards. The curriculum is continuously refined and upgraded. Traditional curriculum dissemination and delivery efforts are enhanced by an e-learning network, a Web-based repository, and mobile laboratories.\r\n\r\nThe instructor training and program building efforts employ a tiered \"train-the-trainer\" model designed for scalability and self-sustaining growth. The model is complemented by curriculum working group meetings, faculty development workshops, and residency opportunities. From its beginning with 13 instructors at 8 sites, the center aims to incorporate 84 expert instructors teaching courses at 10 CareerTech centers and 18 two-year colleges in Oklahoma and 5 neighboring states (Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, and Texas).\r\n\r\nThe center has strong mechanisms for recruiting, retaining, and placing members of underrepresented groups and underprivileged individuals. Minority students and females constitute, respectively, 30% and 50% of the participating institutions' enrollments. Moreover, first-generation college students constitute more than 50% of enrollments.\r\n\r\nFinally, broad participation by industry, government, and the military and strong support from Oklahoma's Governor, Secretary of Commerce, and Chancellor of Higher Education ensure that the center is contributing to homeland security initiatives, workforce creation, and economic development, as well as to academic programs at two-year institutions in Oklahoma and in neighboring states.",
