However, a unique class of such materials, which exhibit thermally driven phase transitions, offers the unprecedented ability to manipulate interfacial properties on demand with a temperature switch. This research focuses on the design of \"smart\" biomaterial coatings based on one of the most widely used temperature sensitive polymers, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM). The specific objectives of this research are: (1) characterize the properties and phase behavior of PNIPAM films by employing direct molecular force measurements, light scattering, and spectroscopy, and (2) to define molecular level design rules for thermally responsive coatings with defined properties. The technical significance of this work lies in this unique approach to defining engineering design rules for biomaterial coatings. The potential uses of PNIPAM range from drug delivery coatings to chromatographic supports. These studies will therefore have broad impact in a number of areas of biotechnology. Furthermore, PNIPAM is one of a larger class of water-soluble polymers that exhibit similar phase behavior. Finally, this research will support the training of students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering.\r\n",
