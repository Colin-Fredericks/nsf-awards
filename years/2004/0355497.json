 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project covers several important topics in Extremal and\r\nProbabilistic Combinatorics. The first group of questions concerns the\r\nRamsey and Turan numbers of sparse graphs. More precisely, the author\r\nwants to study degenerate graphs, i.e., graphs in which every subgraph has\r\nbounded average degree. Here one goal is to show that such graphs have\r\nRamsey numbers which grow linearly in the size of the graph. An additional\r\ngoal is to obtain tight estimates for the Turan numbers of degenerate\r\nbipartite graphs. Both problems were posed many years ago by Erdos, and\r\ndespite all efforts are still open. Another set of questions deals mainly\r\nwith the study of the chromatic and choice numbers of graphs. The author\r\nplans to study two conjectures about graphs whose choice number is equal\r\nto their chromatic number. Since usually there is a huge gap between these\r\ntwo parameters, cases in which equality holds are extremely interesting.\r\nAnother set of questions is about asymptotic properties of random graphs.\r\nHere investigators goal is to understand the distribution of independent\r\nsets of nearly optimal size in sparse random graphs, and use this to\r\ndetermine the asymptotic behavior of its choice number. It is sometimes\r\nthe case that an existence proof, supplied by the probabilistic method, is\r\nnot sufficient and it is better to have an explicit construction. One of\r\nthe major open problems in this field is to construct exponentially large\r\ngraphs, without a clique or an independent set of size k. In this project\r\ninvestigator intends to consider this problem together with its bipartite\r\nversion.\r\n\r\nLeave nothing to chance. This cliche embodies the common belief that\r\nrandomness has no place in carefully planned methodologies. In modern\r\nCombinatorics at least, nothing can be further from the truth. Here the\r\nProbabilistic Method has been developed intensively and become one of the\r\nmost powerful and widely used tools. Use of probability proved to be\r\nhelpful in tackling many long standing open problems. Another major reason\r\nfor the development of this method is the important role of randomness in\r\nTheoretical Computer Science. Here algorithm which make random choices\r\nduring its execution proved to be simplest and fastest for many\r\napplications. The PI plans to develop new probabilistic tools and\r\ntechniques and apply them to various combinatorial problems. Some of these\r\nproblems and conjectures have been open for few decades.\r\n\r\n",
