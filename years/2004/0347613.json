 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to develop a comprehensive structured video representation via advanced statistical modeling approaches. The goal of research is to enhance interpretability and manipulability of visual data, leading to effective visual communications and innovative multimedia applications. The approach consists of four major research components: (1) joint frame and object video segmentation that applies advanced statistical clustering methods; (2) object-oriented structured video representation that integrates extended HMMs and is able to capture important structures in space and time; (3) the application in visual communications; (4) the application in the MPEG-7 Multimedia standard. This research addresses fundamental issues in visual information processing, with widespread applications in diverse areas, including multimedia, digital library, security surveillance, entertainment, biomedical imaging, and human-computer interface, etc. Moreover, the proposed research has significant contribution to industry standards (MPEG-7). The results of the project will be disseminated by scientific papers, software, online demos, and prototype video databases, which can be accessed from the project's website http://www.vcipl.okstate.edu.\r\n\r\nThe education al component includes the development of a unique Multidisciplinary Imaging Science & Technology Program (MISTP). The MISTP will provide students, particularly, minority and women students, with practical, ``hands-on'', research and experimental skills to help them succeed in a culturally diverse, cross-disciplinary research and work environment. The MISTP will impact students at all levels in multiple Science and Engineering disciplines. Dissemination of educational components will be implemented in a web-based format and by more traditional means. Program descriptions and educational materials will be distributed in professional conferences and made publicly available.\r\n",
