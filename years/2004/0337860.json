Project Summary\r\nTitle: Groundwork Education in Mathematics & Science (GEMS)\r\nInstitution: University of Louisville\r\nPI/co-PIs: Christine Rich (PI), Wiley Williams (Co-PI), LeeAnn Nickerson (Co-PI), Linda\r\nJewell (Co-PI)\r\nNumber of Fellows per year: 9-graduate/3 undergraduates\r\nSetting: Urban\r\nNSF Supported Disciplines Involved: Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, and Geosciences\r\n\r\nNarrative Summary: The University of Louisville GEMS program is exploring strategies for improving the quality of science and mathematics education at six Title I elementary schools in\r\nthe Jefferson County Public Schools (JCPS) by instituting a job-embedded professional development program that partners elementary teachers and STEM graduate or undergraduate students in the classroom. Fellows, teachers, university faculty, and JCPS specialists in mathematics and science form an inclusive learning community committed to the development and implementation of inquiry-based teaching methods aligned with state and national standards. Twelve Fellows and twenty-four teachers, assembled into 6-member School Teams, use NSF-supported curricula in science (FOSS, DSM II, and STC) and Investigations in Number, Data, and Space as the primary focus for laying a scientifically and pedagogically sound groundwork for presentation of STEM concepts to students in grades 3-5. Fellows receive preparatory training to familiarize them with state and national standards, current mathematics and science methods, and state assessments. School teams train together in hands-on summer workshops that emphasize cooperative strategies for melding curricular content with teaching practices that best foster student learning. Biweekly seminars and mentoring support provide new learning opportunities and sustained professional development throughout the academic year.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of GEMS resides in its research-based approach to integrating into the JCPS elementary schools an effective model for professional development that increases student interest and learning in mathematics and science. Fellows improve their communication skills as they devise level-appropriate methods for effectively conveying content to both teachers and their students. Benefits to elementary teachers include content resource support from both the Fellows and the university faculty, an improved ability to teach using inquiry-based learning and, the opportunity to make presentations and assume PD leadership roles in their school. Elementary students in the chosen schools benefit from content-enriched, inquiry-based instruction aimed at improving their performance on Kentucky's high-stakes assessments.\r\n\r\nA broader impact is that the university, and in particular science and mathematics faculty\r\nin the College of Arts and Sciences, benefit by expanding partnerships with local school districts. Another broader impact is potentially far-reaching: GEMS proposes a model of collaboration among STEM researchers and STEM educators at both the institutional and school level to advance the teaching and learning of science and mathematics. That collaborative and diverse partnership is already reflected by the composition of GEMS leadership. The recruitment and selection strategies for Fellows and teachers are aimed at ensuring that School Team composition is equally inclusive and diverse. Finally, GEMS is structured such that participants at every level can be actively engaged in GEMS research and educational activities including training, classroom teaching, project evaluation and outcome dissemination.  This project is partially supported by funds from the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n",
