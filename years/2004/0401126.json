Its main goal is to develop new techniques to\r\nestablish the optimal regularity  in fully-nonlinear\r\ndegenerate elliptic equations.  The proposed work  is also  motivated by\r\nthe well known  Weyl problem with nonnegative Gaussian curvature.\r\nThe aim of  the third part of the  project  is to study the connection\r\nbetween the geometry and  the  regularity  as well as  the  formation of\r\nsingularities  in  Stefan type free-boundary problems including also  the\r\nHele-Shaw flow  and free-boundary problem in  flame propagation. The use\r\nof  the geometric aspects of the problems is crucial in the proposed\r\napproach. The last part of the proposed activity   will study  the asymptotic\r\nbehavior of solutions  of variousmodels of  singular diffusion.  In particular, \r\nit  will deal  with the type II blow up behavior of   maximal solutions of the two \r\ndimensionalRicci Flow. These solutions  correspond  to complete Riemannian conformal\r\nmetrics  on a non-compact surface.\r\n\r\nThis  project links  a wide range of active fields of mathematics,  in\r\nparticular  nonlinear partial differential equations, geometry and\r\nclassical analysis.The proposed research activity  on the geometry and regularity of\r\ndegenerate nonlinear parabolic equations and free-boundary problems may\r\nresult to  significant geometric and even topological applications. The\r\nproposed research activity  on Stefan type free-boundary problems is\r\nclosely relatedto various important physical models,  including  the propagation of the\r\npremixed equi-diffusional flames in the limit of high activation energy.\r\nThe models of singular diffusion which will be studied\r\nin this project   arise  in various\r\nphysical  applications such as  population dynamics, the kinetic theory of\r\ngases and thin liquid film dynamics.\r\nStudents and postdocs will be trained as part of this project. \r\n Special emphasis will be given to the\r\nencouragement of talented femaleundergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs\r\nto pursue a successfulcareer in mathematics or related sciences.   New courses linking  \r\nPartialDifferential Equations and Geometric Analysis  for graduate students will be designed\r\nand implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
