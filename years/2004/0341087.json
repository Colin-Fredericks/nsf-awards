 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Darin Ulness of Concordia College at Moorhead will conduct experimental and theoretical research on the development of noisy light spectroscopy as a tool for investigations of ultrafast dynamics in liquids.  The interaction of noisy light with liquids in Raman-based nonlinear optical processes will be studied.  The results of this investigation will be used to develop Raman-enhanced Kerr effect spectroscopy [I(3) RIKES)] into an analytical tool for probing ultrafast liquid dynamics.  \r\n\r\nThis research project will make a positive impact on the science program of Concordia College in that it is suitable for participation not only by chemistry, but also by physics and biology students and faculty.  The work will be conducted with the assistance of postdoctoral research associates and undergraduate students.  These associates and students will receive training and exposure in a forefront area of contemporary physical chemistry that will prepare them for advanced study or entry into the scientific/technological workforce. \r\n",
