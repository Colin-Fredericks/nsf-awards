 "awd_abstract_narration": "This GK-12 project develops a partnership between Polytechnic University and 3 New York City high schools to enhance student achievement in the Regents Exam of Living Environment, Physics, and Math--A.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposal includes, raising academic achievement of students in STEM disciplines; stimulating students' interest in science and math by integrating \"high-tech\" sensing and data collection technologies in high school STEM curriculum, instruction, and laboratory; giving professional development opportunities to teachers; and encouraging cross-pollination of education research and technical concepts among the university and school faculty.   \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impacts of the proposal include reinforcing STEM training and educational experience of a socially diverse and economically disadvantaged inner-city student body; building the laboratory infrastructure for sensor-based STEM curriculum and instruction; and broadening the ties of Polytechnic's Packard Center with local school districts and local businesses to sustain and grow its outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThis proposal is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Engineering \r\n\r\n \r\nTitle: Track 1, GK-12:  Revitalizing Achievement by using Instrumentation in Science and Engineering (RAISE)\r\nInstitution: Polytechnic University\r\nPI/Co-PI: Vikram Kapila, Magued Iskander, and Noel Kriftcher\r\nPartner School Districts: George Westinghouse, Paul Robeson, and Seward Park\r\nNumber of Fellows per Year: 6 graduate students, 6 undergraduate  \"RAISE Fellows\"\r\nTarget Audience: Grades 9-12 (High School), 900 students per year\r\nSetting: Urban\r\nNSF Supported Disciplines: Science, math, and technology\r\n",
