 "awd_abstract_narration": "Terrestrial-Aquatic Biological Systems (TABS) such as headwater catchments and flood-plain rivers are integrated by hydrologic linkages between system components. TABS can be viewed as dynamic and adaptive \"microbiological networks\" that exchange genes, cells, nutrients, and electron donors/acceptors along hydrologic flow paths.  This planning project focuses on development of a research plan to address the following questions: 1) How do microbial assemblages within TABS interact with dynamic hydrologic processes to form microbiological networks and how does the emergence of these networks influence phylogenetic and functional diversity within microbial assemblages? and 2) How do microbiological networks influence coarser-scale biological processes and patterns within TABS (e.g., patterns in biogeochemistry and the distribution of macroscopic organisms)? A workshop will be held to gather experts in microbiology, biogeochemistry, landscape ecology, geosciences, simulation modeling, and network theory to develop a synthesis paper describing the concept of microbiological networks and craft a research proposal to study them. \r\nIntellectual Merit: The concept of microbiological networks provides a framework for integrating microbiology with hydrologic and ecosystem science. Specifically, the concept will yield improved understanding of: 1) geo-hydrologic controls on microbial diversity, leading to better understanding of biological responses to perturbations such as climate change, land use actions, and hydrologic flow regulation; and 2) the mechanisms by which linked microbial assemblages influence biogeochemical cycling within TABS, thereby creating a formal framework for studying the importance of microbial diversity in landscapes. \r\nBroader Impacts: This project focuses on the Baltimore LTER site (Maryland) and Umatilla River Flood Plain (Oregon) and includes a strategy to incorporate undergraduate education programs at Howard University (serving African Americans near the Baltimore LTER site) and Blue Mountain Community College (serving Native Americans on the Umatilla Indian Reservation). Further, project activities provide substantive opportunities for early-career scientists to take leadership roles and to interact with well established scientists in the development of new scientific integration. \r\n",
