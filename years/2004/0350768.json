 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under this award the PIs will be responsible for the duration of the Marine Geological Samples Laboratory (MGSL) of the Graduate School of Oceanography (GSO), University of Rhode Island. This facility serves as the central repository for marine geological samples collected by faculty, staff and students of the Graduate School. The present collection consists of 1729 deep-sea cores, 583 dredge samples and 693 coastal grab samples. During the past three years there has been a continued strong demand for sediment core and dredge rock samples distributed from the MGSL to qualified investigators. Information about the sample collection at URI is now available\r\nOnline through the MGSL website with interactive maps for determining sample distribution. Sample request demand will continue to grow as new cores and dredge samples are added to the collection.  Over the next three years proposed activities will include duration of new core and dredge rock samples, further description of existing samples, enhancement of the MGSL website, submittal of sample information to the NGDC core curators' database, and initiation of routine logging for new core acquisitions.  The Marine Geological Samples Lab will be used as a laboratory facility for graduate instruction in Marine Geology and for public outreach in the form of tours for school groups and the general public interested in looking at samples from the seafloor and the techniques that are used to collect them. Electronic dissemination of the information about the facility and seafloor samples will take place through continued upgrading of the MGSL website.\r\n",
