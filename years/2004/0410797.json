Such a skeleton can be employed to quickly esti-mate the performance of a long running application on a given set of execution nodes even when the nodes and network links are shared. This project is per-forming research to enable automatic construction of performance skeletons of resource intensive applications. A performance skeleton must mimic application execution behavior, such as computation, memory, and communication pat-terns, in order to model the application's performance. The approach being taken to construct the performance skeleton of an application consists of the following steps:\r\n\r\n(1) Execute the target application and record the execution trace that captures detailed CPU, memory and network activity.  (2) Capture repeated patterns in the application execution trace and summarize it as a compact execution signa-ture.  (3) Generate the performance skeleton executable program from the summarized system activity captured by the execution signature.\r\n\r\nPerformance modeling is central to effective use of high performance computa-tional resources. Performance skeletons represent a fast, innovative and accu-rate approach to estimating the performance of long running applications on diverse and unpredictable grid environments. Accurate performance estimation with this method typically takes only a few seconds of skeleton execution for applications that run for several hours. This project is also developing a frame-work for resource selection in grid environments with performance skeletons.\r\n",
