 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hybrid polymer-inorganic materials represent an important development in the polymer\r\nmaterials field due to the ability to potentially tailor the physical properties of these materials\r\nwith varying chemical composition and percentage of the inorganic component. This Research at\r\nUndergraduate Institutions (RUI) proposal addresses several areas of intellectual merit. The\r\nprimary technical objective of this study is to understand the fundamental physicochemical\r\nsurface properties of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS)-based nanocomposite\r\npolymer materials when modified by oxidizing or reducing plasma environments, and their longterm\r\nstability at elevated temperatures or with ultraviolet light exposure. A second objective is to\r\ndetermine whether plasma-modified POSS-based polymers can be used as a coating material for\r\nimproved polymer microfluidic devices. Plasma control of the spatial and chemical composition\r\nof the POSS-based polymer surface will be achieved using a remote plasma treatment tool and\r\nthe properties will be studied using a combination of surface analysis techniques including x-ray\r\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic and lateral force microscopy (AFM/LFM), scanning\r\nelectron microscopy (SEM), and contact angle measurements. Test designs for PMMA-based\r\nmicrofluidic devices have been fabricated, and POSS-based thin films will be deposited onto\r\nthese to determine the change in electroosmotic flow (EOF) characteristics using plasma surface\r\nmodification. Spatial control of the surface will be accomplished through a microfabricated\r\nshadow mask allowing for a hydrophilic / hydrophobic gradient to be patterned into the\r\nmicrofluidic channel. EOF and fluid flow measurements will be made in collaboration with the\r\nUniversity of Virginia to determine whether fluid flow can be controlled through a spatially\r\nmodulated surface within a microfluidic structure. A further objective is to design and develop\r\nan integrated detection methodology for microfluidic devices using ultraviolet-visible absorption\r\nspectroscopy taking advantage of the lower absorption edge of PMMA compared to the glass\r\nsubstrates typically used in microfluidic devices.\r\nA final objective related to the broader impacts of this proposal is the scientific training of\r\nundergraduate research students and high school science teachers in a highly interdisciplinary\r\nresearch environment. This project will involve the training of six to ten undergraduate\r\nresearchers and three high school chemistry, physics or biology teachers over the duration of the\r\nprogram. In both cases, this project will introduce undergraduate chemistry and physics students\r\nand secondary school teachers to the materials science issues of structure-property relationships.\r\nBoth students and teachers will be exposed to surface analytical techniques, vacuum science,\r\npolymer materials characterization and processing, and microfluidic technology and science. The\r\nparticipants in this program will also interact with graduate students and post-doctoral\r\nresearchers at the University of Virginia through direct laboratory exposure in order to\r\nexperience research at a research institution. These activities help serve to broadly impact the\r\npipeline of future scientists from the high school through the graduate level.",
