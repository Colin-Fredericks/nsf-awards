The conference will not only address basic science and technology issues of environmental biotechnology, but also international collaboration, environmental justice, and ethical, legal, and social implications of the technology. The speakers include scientists, engineers, and policy makers from the U.S. and many foreign organizations.  The organizers have selected a geographical breadth of speakers, as well as included women as chairs for about half of the sessions. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers have also been invited to give oral presentations.  The keynote lecturers include distinguished woman scientists and government representatives. The funding provided by NSF will be used to support the participation of U.S. attendees from academic institutions, with preference given to junior scientists, postdocs, and graduate students.",
