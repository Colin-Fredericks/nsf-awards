 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will demonstrate the feasibility of \r\ndeveloping a novel acoustic wave sensor for use as an oil quality monitor for motor vehicles and \r\nindustrial machinery.  Normally oil quality is not monitored in situ.  The most common method of \r\nensuring oil quality is to change the oil after a specified amount of time or miles.  The research objectives \r\nwill be to determine the ideal excitation geometry for the sensor, fully characterize the sensor to \r\nmechanical and electrical perturbations of the contacting liquid, and demonstrate that the sensor can \r\nreliably monitor engine oil quality.  Phase I work will demonstrate that the sensor is a vast improvement over both standard quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs) and QCMs with modified electrode geometries.  The result will be acoustic wave sensors that are highly stable and optimized for oil quality monitoring.  \r\n     The development of an oil quality sensor will demonstrate that cutting edge sensor research can be brought to commercialization and at the same time promote teaching, training and learning for high school (HS), undergraduate (UG), and graduate (G) students.  This project, in concert with an existing NSF Grades Kindergarten-12 (GK-12) program and a previously funded NSF science education grant integrating sensors into the UG and G engineering programs, will offer research, educational and job opportunities for HS, UG and G students to participate in the proposed project.  The successful demonstration of an oil quality sensor will motivate the development of similar sensors for applications in health, agricultural, automotive, environmental and military areas. \r\n",
