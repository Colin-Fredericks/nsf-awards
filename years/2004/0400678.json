 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is about a theory of new- and oldforms for irreducible\r\nadmissible representations of the algebraic group PGSp(4,F), for F a\r\nnonarchimedean local field of characteristic zero. The first objective\r\nof this research is to prove the main conjecture, supported by\r\nextensive evidence, which asserts that a generic representation admits\r\na nonzero vector fixed by a paramodular group of some level; that at\r\nthe minimal level such a vector is unique up to nonzero scalars; and\r\nthat at the minimal level a suitable normalization of such a vector,\r\ncalled a newform, computes the L-factor of the representation. The\r\nsecond objective is to prove a precise conjecture about the structure\r\nof the spaces of oldforms in a generic representation, i.e., the spaces\r\nof vectors fixed by paramodular groups of level exceeding the minimal\r\nlevel. The third, and final, objective is to investigate whether a\r\nversion of the main conjecture holds for nongeneric representations at\r\nthe level of L- or A-packets.\r\n\r\nBriefly summarized, number theory is the part of mathematics concerned\r\nwith the study of integral solutions to algebraic equations. Though the\r\nproblems of number theory often can be simply stated,  solutions may\r\nrequire extensive theoretical development and input from other parts of\r\nmathematics. Broadly characterized, this research seeks to tie\r\ntogether, in a useful and new way, two parts of number theory.  The\r\nfirst part, the theory of automorphic representations, allows the\r\nformulation of comprehensive conjectures and proofs; however,\r\nautomorphic representations are abstract. The second part, the theory\r\nof Siegel modular forms, is important for examples and applications; on\r\nthe other hand, Siegel modular forms can hide important general\r\nphenomena. By developing the theory of local new- and oldforms for\r\nPGSp(4) this research will make it easier to systematically and\r\nconceptually construct Siegel modular forms from automorphic\r\nrepresentations, and thus may lead to work that draws on the strengths\r\nof both theories.  This research crosses several subdisciplines of\r\nmathematics, and to facilitate this and other work this project will\r\ncreate a freely accessible database on the World Wide Web about the\r\nexisting literature on GSp(4).\r\n\r\n",
