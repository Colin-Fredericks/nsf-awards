The workshop is organized by PI\r\nwith Kai Behrend from the University of British Columbia,\r\nCanada. One objective of the proposed workshop is to bring\r\ntogether the groupoid community (consisting of both differential\r\ngeometers and operator algebraists) and the stack community, in\r\norder to encourage more interaction and cross-fertilization\r\nbetween these fields. PI also wishes to bring to the workshop\r\nphysicists working on quantum field theory and string theory,\r\nsince physics has been a steady source of ideas in the\r\naforementioned subjects.\r\n\r\nGroupoids/stacks is a mathematical notion which arises naturally\r\nin order to study symmetries of objects such as finite parts of a\r\ncrystal.  It is related to mechanics, physics, and geometry. The\r\nsubject may also have potential applications to biology. There\r\nare many bright young people working in these subjects around the\r\nworld and this workshop will be a great opportunity to bring\r\nU.S. researchers, especially young people, to exchange their\r\nideas with their international colleagues and to broaden their\r\nperspective. PI anticipates inviting many mathematicians at the\r\npostdoctoral and graduate student level (from the United States,\r\nAfrica, Canada, and Europe) to the workshop.\r\n\r\n",
