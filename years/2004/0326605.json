 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Regulography\"- Quantitative Reconstruction of Transcriptional Regulatory Networks\r\nJames C. Liao, Vwani Roychowdhury, Chiara Sabatti, David Eisenberg, Fuyuhiko Tamanoi, University of California, Los Angeles\r\n\r\nGoal and Tasks: The goal of this project is to reconstruct the hidden structure and dynamics of transcriptional regulatory networks based on massive gene expression data (generated from DNA microarray) and regulatory models under the constraints of various ancillary information, such as protein interactions with DNA, other proteins, and RNA. The ultimate outcome of the project will be an integrated framework (incorporating both methodology and the required databases) for deducing transcriptional network structure and dynamic, which can be applied to define the signal transduction pathways perturbed by unknown drug effects, toxic compound challenges, and mutations. We are using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as the model eukaryote for verification of our paradigm. Toward this end, we are pursuing the following specific tasks: (1) Develop an analytical and IT-based framework for quantitative and dynamic reconstructions of various pre-translational regulatory networks. This includes transcriptional regulation (as governed by protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions), and processing, transport, and stability regulation of mRNA (as governed by various protein-mRNA interactions). This work builds on a novel system-reconstruction methodology called Network Component Analysis. (2) Acquire and organize data for protein-DNA, protein-protein interaction, protein-RNA interactions, mRNA stability, and gene-expression noise. (3) Experimental verification of the paradigm of the framework developed in (1) and (2).  (4) Disseminate the results through a composite \"regulographic\" database.\r\nTeam Organization: The PIs of this project come from five different fields: Dr. Liao is a chemical/biochemical engineer specialized in metabolic engineering and DNA microarray analysis, Dr. Roychowdrury is an electrical engineer/computer scientist specialized in networks and systems theories, Dr. Tamamoi is a microbiologist specialized in yeast genetics, Dr. Eisenberg is a renowned biochemist/crystallographer specialized in protein structure, function, and protein-protein interactions, and Dr.Sabatti is a statistician specialized in genetic and microarray analyses.\r\nBroader Impact: In addition to the fundamental scientific discoveries proposed here, we are pursuing the  following  information  technology  related  activities:  (1)  As  part  of  the  interdisciplinary  bioinformatics  program  at  UCLA,  we  plan  to  develop  a  two-part  course  on  intracellular  regulatory  networks  (targeted  toward  upper-level  undergraduate  students  and  beginning graduate students in both engineering and biological fields) . (2) We will leverage the organizational infrastructure of a number of  interdisciplinary research institutes on UCLA campus (including, the NSF Institute for Pure and  Applied Mathematics,  the California  Nano-Science  Institute, and the  Institute  for  Cell Mimetic  Space  Exploration)  to  attract  both  undergraduate  and  graduate  minority  students.  (3)  We  will  integrate our experimental and analytical results into a dynamic database, and make it available to  the larger community, which we believe will spur and aid research efforts on intracellular process  modeling at a much larger scale, involving academic and commercial institutions nation wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
