In his research, he will address:\r\n1. Empirical determinations of masses for low-mass pre-main-sequence stars: 2. Angular momentum evolution of young stars: 3. Interpretive 3-D computer models of protostellar environments.  Leveraging extant Vanderbilt resources, this work encompasses a broad, international research program that will provide measurements of masses and angular momenta for young stars, as well as state-of-the-art computer simulations of the complex environments of protostars.  These measurements will then be used in simulations to test forefront theories of star formation and early stellar evolution.\r\n\r\nDr. Stassun will execute a coherent, systemic education and outreach plan, integrated into the research, with the goal of addressing the order-of-magnitude under representation of minorities in astronomy and astrophysics. His work will: 1. Enhance science learning for minority K-12 students: 2. Increase professional development opportunities for K-12 science teachers, especially those teaching at minority high-schools: 3.  Train a cadre of minority undergraduate and Masters-level students for PhD study in astronomy and astrophysics: 4. Prepare graduate students for their future roles integrating research and education.   This ambitious plan will be made possible by working in partnership with nearby Fisk University, an Historically Black University.\r\n\r\n",
