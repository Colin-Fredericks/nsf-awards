 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Red Raider Symposium at Texas Tech University consists of a series of lectures by outstanding scholars in selected areas of mathematics and statistics. These lectures provide an opportunity to learn about new research venues for the members of the mathematical community, especially early career researchers and graduate students including women and underrepresented minorities. This symposium provides a perfect medium for interaction and new collaboration between the conference participants and the distinguished speakers. In 2002 the Red Raider Mini-Symposium was devoted to Contemporary Algebra and Algebraic Geometry. The distinguished speakers were R. Griess, W. Fulton, J. Lepowsky, G. Margulis, and E. Zelmanov. In 2003 the symposium focuses on Mathematical and Computational Modeling of Biological Systems with the speakers J.D. Humphreys, J. Keener, M. Reed, A. Sherman, and C. Taylor. \r\nFor 2004 the theme of the proposed series will be Invariant Theory in Perspective. Its goal is to bring together researchers from a broad spectrum of mathematics all of which are strongly intertwined with invariant theory. The distinguished lectures will be delivered by Roger Howe, Peter Olver, Karen Parshall, Vladimir Popov, David Wehlau, and Clarence Wilkerson. The symposium will focus on the universality of invariant theory. It will show that invariant theoretic questions occur in a wide range of mathematics, e.g., in commutative and homological algebra, Lie theory, algebraic topology, combinatorics, geometry, coding theory, and mathematical physics. These fields pose often challenging problems to invariant theory, and vice versa: results in invariant theory nurture its neighboring fields. The Red Raider Symposium 2004 provides a forum to shed light on these interactions. \r\nThe Red Raider Symposia are highly multidisciplinary. This concept will initiate new collaborations, and will greatly contribute to the scientific development of graduate students and early career mathematicians who will have the opportunity to interact with some of the most outstanding leaders in their field and to learn about research problems that represent the frontiers of the field. We also hope that it will greatly encourage women and underrepresented minorities to pursue careers in mathematics.\r\n\r\nWebpage: http://www.math.ttu.edu/~mneusel/red04.html\r\n",
