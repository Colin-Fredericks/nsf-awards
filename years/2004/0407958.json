 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Materials Research to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is to improve fundamental understanding how relaxation in systems that are driven away from equilibrium leads to self-organization and the selection of preferred length scales. This project will be based on a general theoretical framework for driven systems that has been developed over time by Professors Averback and Bellon, the PIs of this award. Engineering materials are traditionally processed using time and temperature as control variables. In many advanced processing schemes, or in service, materials are also subjected to a sustained external forcing, for example, thin films processed by ion beams or materials undergoing frictional wear. These dynamically driven materials are no longer constrained to follow kinetic paths controlled by equilibrium thermodynamics. There is now a large base of work showing that phases that would be metastable, or even unstable under equilibrium conditions, can be stabilized under dynamical forcing. An important new development has been the prediction that, under appropriate conditions, the composition and the chemical order in driven materials can self-organize at the nanoscale. Analytical models and atomistic computer simulations suggest that specific length scales introduced by the external forcing are at the origin of these self-organization reactions. Some preliminary experiments support the conclusion that compositional patterning can be triggered by both irradiation and plastic deformation, but the critical experiments that could provide validation of these new models are lacking. The central idea of this research is to perform such experiments, critically and systematically testing the model predictions. The focus is on materials irradiated by energetic ion beams, as the advanced understanding of the physical processes involved during irradiation makes it possible to perform experiments with excellent control. By varying the irradiation conditions the length scales introduced by the external forcing are systematically varied, thus allowing for quantitative tests of the model predictions. In parallel to this experimental work, atomistic computer simulations are developed to include the role played by interstitial atoms and surfaces. Indeed, when interstitial atoms couple selectively to one chemical species, the interstitial diffusion distance before its recombination with a vacancy or its elimination on a sink becomes a relevant length scale for the evolution of the alloy. Surfaces not only provide a well-defined sink, but also add the interesting new dimensions of equilibrium and non-equilibrium segregation.  \r\n\r\nThis research has broad impacts for advancing scientific understanding. There is a wide range of materials phenomena that can be described within the framework of driven systems, including fatigue, severe plastic deformation, frictional wear, and dealloying. As the general validity is established for the irradiation of alloys as a model system, these other behaviors become better understood as well. In addition, the research offers educational opportunities for graduate students who will be trained on advanced instruments for materials characterization. The present work will be integrated into teaching activities, exposing undergraduate students to the potentials and the challenges offered by nanostructured materials. The investigators plan to introduce a \"Materials Van\" for local high schools that would offer materials science demonstrations to increase the awareness of students to the daily use of materials in our technological society.",
