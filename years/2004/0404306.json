 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate the effect of a thin conductive layer deposited on nanotube (NT) and nanofiber (NF) reinforced polymers.  The approach will be to deposit a layer (50nm) of titanium carbide (TiC) on NT and NF polymer (polyethylene, polypropylene, and liquid crystal polymers) composites. Interfacial analysis and electrical studies (resistivity and electromagnetic attenuation) will be conducted. Preliminary observations indicate a significant increase in electrical conductivity upon coating the sample, to a value higher than that of both, the uncoated material and the TiC.  This investigation will offer exciting insight into the interactions between conducting surface and conducting matrix.  The study offers the possibility of being able to lower the percolation threshold of NT/NF polymer composites. In parallel, this investigation could provide a technological breakthrough for a new class of materials whose electrical conductivities can be tailored according to the desired application.\r\nThe University of Texas Pan American is a Hispanic Serving Institution with more than 85% Hispanic enrollment. NSF funding to Dr. Lozano has allowed the development of a strong research group (mainly undergraduates). The opportunity to work on cutting edge research has already motivated students to pursue advanced degrees, increasing the number of under-represented scientists. The collaborative effort will offer an exciting opportunity for UTPA students to participate in research at The Aerospace Corporation to gain valuable practical experience. Results derived from this research will promote insights into interfacial and electrical properties of a new class of materials providing tools for tailoring manufacturing techniques.  \r\n\r\n",
