Among the many strategies for meeting this commitment is the introduction of modern technologies to the region, and education in the application of these technologies. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) purchased through funding from this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant will be housed within the Department of Physical Sciences, providing the opportunity for faculty and students to use a major scientific instrument for education and research.   Four disciplines on the MSU campus and one outside industry have been identified that are committed to making use of the instrument, and there are many other potential users both on and off of campus.  The acquisition of a SEM at MSU, with its ease of use, will make research more accessible to the faculty, providing opportunities to gain new knowledge and remain current in their chosen fields.  Research that will immediately benefit from the SEM include:  petrologic studies of mid-continental rift rocks; taxonomic investigations in entomology and palynology; studies of art pigment degradation; metallurgical research; and process engineering studies in the manufacture of bearings.  In addition to promoting ongoing research, there are plans to integrate this instrument into the classroom and involve student research.  Approximately 40 majors per year graduate in the Biological and Physical Sciences, which requires a \"capstone\" course that includes original research.  The SEM is a perfect instrument because of its versatility and ease of use.  With the acquisition of this single instrument, it is estimated that over 100 students per year will benefit, whether through direct research, or exposure in various classes.  In addition, local industry will benefit, which has effects on the economy of the Morehead area.  \r\n***\r\n",
