 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Miami University at Oxford, Ohio, under the direction of Dr. Luis Actis for the acquisition of instrumentation for high-throughput DNA studies using modern molecular techniques, such as automated DNA nucleotide sequencing and fragment analysis as well as gene expression in a wide range of organisms and microorganisms. This instrumentation also includes hardware and software to collect, store, and analyze nucleotide sequences and DNA fragment data using automated and manual Bioinformatics tools. The ultimate and common goals of these studies are the understanding of the structure and evolution of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes and their expression under different environmental conditions. The acquisition of the state-of-the-art instrumentation described in this project, which allows the simultaneous processing and analysis of large number of samples, will facilitate the achievement of the research, teaching and training goals of these projects.\r\n\r\nThis award will support research and training activities in a broad array of scientific fields including Bacterial and Viral Genomics, Microbial Diversity, Environmental Genomics, Evolutionary Biology, Functional Genomics, and Protein Biochemistry. These activities are conducted by active investigators working in the departments of Botany, Chemistry/Biochemistry, Geology, Microbiology, and Zoology. In addition, interactions with faculty in the Computer Science department interested in Bioinformatics and\r\nComputational Biology will be enhanced as a direct consequence of this award. One of goals of these academic activities is to bring modern multidisciplinary research approaches to study complex biological problems at the genetic level while instructing and training faculty, staff, and students at Miami University in the emerging fields of Bioinformatics, Genomics, and Computational Biology.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance of the acquired instrumentation is that it will allow Miami University to continue with its commitment to the constant enhancement of the academic programs, which will provide superior instructional and research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students in current and emerging scientific fields. In addition to the number of students who would receive an improved educational experience, the quality and diversity of these students will be impacted by this instrumentation and technology. Miami University is committed to attract students as well as faculty members belonging to minority and underrepresented groups looking for higher education in science. This instrumentation will also foster new research programs as well as collaborations among scientist with common research interests. Ultimately, all these activities should serve the community by instructing and training new generations in modern technology used to study complex and significant biological problems and processes.\r\n\r\n",
