 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II research project develops a temperature-adaptive nanoparticles-based solid lubricant coating (ZnO  and MoS2 and their metastable forms) on textured cBN/TiN for hard turning and dry machining applications. The uniquely coated tool inserts are able to constantly release the lubricants out of reservoirs on the textured cBN/TiN surface.  Currently  available solid  lubricant  coatings  do  not  offer  temperature-adaptive  properties  and  are  NOT suitable  for hard turning applications.  Hard turning can offer manufacturers large cost savings compared to grinding.    However, the  achievable  surface  finish  is  critical.  The  preliminary  results indicate that the proposed solid lubricant coating will enhance hard turning surface finish and provide  greater consistency.   In addition, both  environmental and competitive cost issues are causing  manufacturers  to  migrate  toward  dry  machining.    Solid  lubricant  coatings  can  both improve  surface  finish  and  extend  the  tool  life  in  dry machining  applications  by  lowering  the friction  at  the  interface  between  the  tool  and  the  workpiece.    Commercially  available  solid lubricants  are  primarily  configured  in  layered  structures.    As  wear  progresses,  the  lubrication layer wears away and leaves the hard layer behind.  Thus, the proposed novel configuration that provides temperature  adaptability while also offering continuous long lasting lubrication has great potential. \r\n \r\nThe proposed research is an excellent example of adding value to industrial products  from the investment in nano science and engineering. The project will provide improved understanding of how the tribo-chemistry  of nanoparticle coatings  can offer temperature adaptive properties and affect machining performance.  Also, it will provide insights regarding the micro tribology along \r\nthe boundary of the particles and binder(s). The  primary application of the coating will be for cutting  tools  in  hard  turning  and  dry  machining.    These  are  very  important  and  growing commercial markets.  Additional markets could be for rotating machinery, dies and molds, and other wear parts. The  successful development of the proposed coating  will help reduce environmental waste and contaminants from the usage of coolants.  The disposal of both the used cutting fluid and the contaminated metal chips that were removed during the cutting process is becoming  harder  and  more  costly.    The  cost  of  the  coolant  has  been  widely  estimated  as contributing  over 15%  of  a  typical  part.s machining  costs.    The  project  will  help  facilitate  the adoption of high speed  machining techniques, which is considered  a key factor for the United States maintaining its manufacturing base in the face of strong competition from low labor rate countries.   \r\n \r\n",
