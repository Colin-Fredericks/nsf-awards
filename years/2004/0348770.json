 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Trauner is exploring the use of pericyclic reaction chemistry, particularly cascades of electrocyclizations and cycloadditions, in the synthesis of structurally intriguing natural products. Professor Trauner is pursuing a biomimetic intramolecular dynamic kinetic resolution strategy to antimalarial naphthoquinones, a concise biomimetic synthesis of the complex plant metabolite rubioncolin A, and a unified approach toward polycyclic diterpenes that links three major classes of these natural products. In conjunction with these research efforts, Professor Trauner is developing a series of graduate course offerings and will incorporate modern visualization tools and experimental approaches in the undergraduate chemistry curriculum.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the teaching and research efforts of Professor Dirk Trauner, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California at Berkeley. Professor Trauner is developing efficient and novel methods for the construction of complex organic chemical structures, providing the tools needed for the synthesis of organic compounds of promising activity but insufficient natural abundance to permit recovery from natural sources. Through the development of new courses and course content at a variety of educational levels, Professor Trauner is contributing to the effective education of the next generation of chemists trained to tackle challenging interdisciplinary research problems.",
