 "awd_abstract_narration": "The events of September 11, 2001, have highlighted the impact of malicious attacks on critical national\r\ninfrastructure components. This has resulted in an increased appreciation for improving the physical security of\r\ncritical electric power system components like substations, transmission lines, and generators. These observations\r\ntogether with the major North East blackout of August 14 th , 2003 highlight the importance of the electric grid as an\r\nenergy transport medium and its critical importance to the nation's economy and global competitiveness.\r\nThe electric power grid is a highly automated network. A variety of information networks are interconnected to the\r\nelectric grid for the purpose of sensing, monitoring, and control. Any disturbance or dislocation in the electric\r\nnetwork is sensed primarily by observing the electrical behavior of the power system via the observations and\r\nanalysis done using the data obtained using measurements of electrical quantities. The sensor technology that\r\naids the deployment of distributed sensing systems has improved vastly in the recent past. However, even though,\r\nstandards do exist for physical security of substations, very few modern sensing mechanisms have been utilized to\r\nmeet the physical security standards.\r\nWith this scenario in mind we will undertake the following research in the sensing and information processing of the\r\nelectric grid: (1) examine new sensors to sense physical quantities in power systems; (2) design a wireless sensor\r\ninformation network to transmit these measurements to the central control center; (3) develop algorithms for sensor\r\nplacement, data aggregation, fault diagnosis, and load balancing for the sensor information network; and (4) fuse the\r\nphysical sensor data with conventional electrical sensor data to devise more effective control strategies following\r\nlarge disturbances. We will demonstrate the developed techniques and validate them on a test bed that we have\r\ncreated to emulate a large power system using an operator training simulator. The key elements of the proposed\r\napproach consist of the following steps:\r\n1. Design structure of the wireless sensor information network that maintains connectivity under a variety of\r\ncontingency scenarios in two modes, a) Partial mode that helps in detection of failures, and b) Full mode which\r\nhelps in diagnosis of the problem.\r\n2. The sensor network in Partial Mode will be used to zero in on portions of the power grid where the system\r\nwould like to get physical sensor information to fuse with existing electrical sensors to detect disturbance, and\r\nor catastrophic failures based on: a) On-line risk based engine, b) Unusual or abnormal measurements from\r\ncertain sensors like temperature, motion, or chemical sensors, or c) Weather and unusual conditions.\r\n3. This leads to a decision on transferring to Full Mode operation where more information collection via sensor\r\nactivation and deactivation, communication network connectivity, and power usage considerations will be made\r\nfrom the critical local portion of the power grid identified by the above analysis.\r\n4. This information leads to further diagnosis of the network condition that is used by central control center to\r\ninvoke appropriate control action to safeguard the power network.\r\nIntellectual merit of the proposed research lies in developing novel concepts for integrating a broad range of\r\nsensors that monitor both physical security and operational security of the nation's most critical infrastructure  the\r\nelectric grid. The project aims at using the combined data from these sensors together with the detailed development\r\nof the associated communication and information network to enhance the security and reliability of the power grid.\r\nThe team has combined their expertise to take a fresh view at the different kinds of sensors currently available and\r\nextract appropriate data from them for several key issues related to power system physical security.\r\nThe broader impact of this research will be two fold. First, it will enhance the state of art in sensing, monitoring,\r\nand controlling the electric power grid by combining the multidisciplinary expertise of the investigators. Second, the\r\nnew sensor network will be applied to develop an emergency response system for the national electric grid, which is\r\nessential to the vitality of the nation's economy, and will provide protection to it.\r\nEducation: Our educational goal is to train the next generation of students, train new cadres of doctoral researchers\r\nand most importantly, share the excitement that comes with working in engineering with the youngest of students, in\r\nthe K-12 program, to attract them into science and engineering. The college of engineering at Iowa State University\r\nhas a dedicated effort to attract minority scholars into the graduate program and the university has an ongoing\r\nprogram to employ high school students and teachers in research programs during the summer. We will leverage\r\nthese efforts.",
