 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Hofstra University under the direction of Dr. Christopher Sanford for the support of an Integrated Digital Fluid Flow/Pressure Analysis system (IFPAS). This state-of-the-art system will be used to study patterns of fluid flow important in several biological phenomena. A broad range of research topics will be examined using the IFPAS, including suspension feeding in polychaete worms, the behavioral responses of lobsters to olfactory cues, and feeding in fishes. The research programs of all the users of the equipment will greatly benefit from this system and it is likely to provide significant breakthroughs in our understanding of biologically relevant tasks important in fitness and survival. The IFPAS will also provide new interdisciplinary partnerships including one between Biology and Engineering. It will also foster new collaborations between Hofstra faculty and scientists from neighboring institutions (American Museum of Natural History and University of Rhode Island). \r\n\r\nHofstra University is a Primarily Undergraduate Institution (PUI) so in addition to providing an advanced tool for research the IFPAS will also provide a research-rich training environment for many undergraduate students, the majority of which are from underrepresented groups in science. The IFPAS will significantly increase the scope and quality of research opportunities available to students, and create an exciting and dynamic research environment. The proposed research and modern techniques have widespread applicability to biology and is likely to attract students and retain them in the biological sciences. Biology students will also directly benefit from increased interaction with individuals from other departments as well as neighboring institutions. The IFPAS will be integrated directly into all levels of the new biology curriculum. Research conducted using the IFPAS will also be highlighted on the department website, and coupled with the very visual nature of the data, has tremendous potential to attract prospective students to biology. The equipment will also be incorporated into a course aimed at science teachers, and will therefore have a direct impact on science education in high schools. \r\n",
