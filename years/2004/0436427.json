The Conference will take place 25-31 July, 2004 on a ship traveling through the Inside Passage from Vancouver, BC to Seward, Alaska. This will be the 12th meeting in the series of Life in the Cold conferences begun in 1959. This international gathering of scientists will share their research and ideas on topics related to hibernation and torpor cryobiology, thermoregulation, polar biology, migration and other aspects of over-wintering in animals. The conference will discuss approaches including molecular, cellular, organ, and organismal physiology and biochemistry, functional morphology, biomechanics and biophysics, ecology and evolutionary biology to understand physiological processes and traits of organisms that are adapted to survive in cold environments. The committee selecting recipients of conference support will emphasize the participation of underrepresented minorities and women in the workshop. Students and young faculty will have the opportunity to present their research results to a broad audience of arctic and Antarctic scientists.",
