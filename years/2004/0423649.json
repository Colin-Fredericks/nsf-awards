 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to  develop a new manufacturing process for fabrication of glassy metal matrix particulate composite materials, and to advance the fundamental understanding of the relationships between material properties/function, processing conditions and micro-structure. The approach is to mix glassy (amorphous) metal powder with crystalline metal powder, heat the powder blend up to the point where the glassy metal becomes viscous, and then force them together to remove void space and achieve good inter-particle bonds under high pressure and mechanical shear.   Particle blend consolidation will be achieved by warm equal channel angular extrusion.   A theoretical modeling effort will be done in parallel with the experimental investigations to deepen our knowledge of consolidation, microstructural stability and failure mechanisms of glassy metal particulate materials and help guide improved strategies for fabrication of advanced glassy metal matrix composites.      \r\n\r\nThis research is important because it will pave the way for the manufacture of a new class of very strong advanced engineering structural materials for a variety of civilian and military applications including light weight transportation vehicles.  The project will combine experimental work with modeling studies to improve the understanding of the micro-structural mechanisms responsible for the mechanical failure of such materials and enable the design/manufacture of better composites for engineering applications.  The project will have an impact on K-12 and college students in that short teaching modules and several laboratory demonstration experiments will be developed for presentation to students to build their interest in engineering.       \r\n",
