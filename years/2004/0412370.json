 "awd_abstract_narration": "Troy\r\n     The investigator studies the dynamical behavior of systems\r\nof Wilson-Cowan type integro-differential equations that arise in\r\nmodelling cortex.  His goal is to understand the subtle\r\nconnections between neurons in two-dimensional neural sheets,\r\nwhich are responsible for (i) the formation of stable rotating\r\nwaves, and (ii) the existence of organizing centers that cause\r\nperiodic ring-shaped waves to form and propagate outward through\r\nthe medium.  He employs computational techniques, as well as\r\nasymptotic analysis and reduction methods, which allow the models\r\nto simplfy to tractable forms.  The mathematical and computational\r\nresults predict and verify the existence of stable rotating\r\nspirals, and periodic ring-shaped waves recently discovered in\r\ntangential slices of occipital cortex of rat brain.  The\r\ntechniques developed in this study provide a new direction for\r\nunderstanding persistent pattern formation in general neural\r\nnetwork models.\r\n     Neuronal networks in the central nervous system exhibit a\r\nvariety of persistent wave patterns.  These range from oscillatory\r\nwaves consisting of synchronized bursts of spikes to\r\ntwo-dimensional ring-shaped waves and rotating spirals.  The\r\ninvestigator is interested in understanding how such\r\ntwo-dimensional waves form and propagate in the brain.  He uses\r\nsimulations and mathematical methods to develop models that aid\r\nin the understanding of wave formation.  Cooperative research\r\nbetween the investigator and experimental neuroscientists has led\r\nto the recent discovery of spiral waves in rat cortex.  This is\r\nthe first true verification of spiral waves in mamallian cortex.\r\nSpiral waves are conjectured to be associated with the occurence\r\nof seizures in the brain.  The results of this project are also\r\nincluded in the design of new interdisciplinary courses for\r\nstudents.\r\n",
