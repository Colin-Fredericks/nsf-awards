 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geology (42) A new Web-based virtual fieldtrip (VFT) dealing with volcanic environments is being developed that utilizes inquiry-based exercises to allow students to observe eruptive activity, make field observations, and formulate hypotheses about volcanic processes.  The module uses video segments of eruptive activity and virtual reality panoramic images that enable students to explore volcanic terrains in an immersion environment similar to a real geological fieldtrip. The VFT activities are centered on the 79 A.D. eruption of Vesuvius in Italy. As a result of the burial of the ancient Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, this eruption provides a unique opportunity for students to understand the great power of volcanic eruptions and their impact on human populations. Students can observe eruption footage that is reminiscent of the 79 A.D. event, make observations about eruption impacts, and then visit the excavated cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum to build hypotheses about how each were buried by the eruption.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in bringing scientific content developed through the PI team's extensive experience in NSF-supported volcanological research into the classroom for students who do not have access to such field-based experiences.  Beyond the educational benefits, the broader impacts of this work lie in its development plan, which will occur in coordination with the Student Technology Assistance program at the University of Rhode Island. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in conceptual design, implementation, and progressive field-testing of this VFT.\r\n",
