 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for a collaborative study between the groups of Professor Jovan Mijovic (JM, Polytechnic University, New York) and Professor Jose' Kenny (JK, University of Perugia, Italy), under the aegis of the NSF-European Commission (EC) Cooperative Activity in Materials Research. The proposed study is in the area of nanotechnology, an emerging field that is currently receiving enormous attention worldwide. Professors Mijovic and Kenny have had extensive and prolific collaboration over the past 15 year and are eminently qualified to conduct the proposed research.                                                                                             \r\nIntellectual Merit: A study of dynamics addresses issues that deal with the molecular origin, the length scales and the time scales of different motions in polymers, typically under an applied field, such as electric or mechanical. The resulting knowledge is important; (1) fundamentally - because it provides guidance for the emerging theoretical and computational studies, and (2) practically - because it helps optimize processing and properties of materials. Towards that goal, it is proposed to conduct a systematic investigation of the dynamics of a series of polymer-functionalized nanoparticles, nanotubes and nanonetworks. This marks the first time that such systematic effort is proposed and that the set of complete data of this kind will be provided. The challenge is to revisit the conventional processing-structure-property correlations and develop new principles for creating structures of controlled (nano) length scales that would result in novel materials with distinct (unusual) properties.                                                                                                         \r\nBroader Impact: The broader impact of the proposed research will result from the development of fundamental understanding how the functionalized nanoparticles and nanotubes affect the dynamics and, in turn, the processing and the properties of nanocomposites and nanonetworks. It is anticipated that this fundamental understanding will be directly relevant to a host of other systems. One example is dendritic macromolecules, where chains are tethered to functionalized nanopartciles, yet little is known about their dynamics. We also anticipate that our findings will have a significant impact in the field of biopolymers; DNAs, proteins and membranes. There are various examples of bio-related issues, ranging from gene therapy, polynucleotide tethering used to create DNA chips, and protein folding, to loops and \"cruciforms\" (junctions) in coiled DNA, where dynamics are thought to play an important role and where new insights could emerge based on the results of our study.                                                                                                        \r\nFinally, the graduate education in an interdisciplinary environment coupled with international exchange is conducive to producing PhDs with a unique background. The proposed work will also contribute to the enhancement of ethnic diversity by accommodating (in the PI's lab) and involving in research a number of under-represented minority students from New York City high schools under the aegis of the YES (Youth in Engineering and Science) summer program at Polytechnic. The results of our work will be broadly disseminated within the scientific community through presentations at international meetings and publications in first-tier journals. In addition, an attractive, interactive website will be created and advertised immediately following the approval of the proposal.\r\n",
