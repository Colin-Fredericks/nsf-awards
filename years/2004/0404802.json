 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for the Advancement of Scholarship on Engineering Education (CASEE) of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) is building upon the National Survey of Student Engagement, the Faculty Survey of Student Engagement, and the ABET EC2000 Study in order to develop integrated assessment tools that will measure faculty and student engagement in instructional and learning practices that may correlate with desired student learning outcomes in undergraduate engineering programs.  To provide the context and basis for these assessment tools, we are developing: i) a set of synthesized learning outcomes for undergraduate engineering education that reflect the desires of the academic and employer communities; and ii) a pilot database summarizing the education research literature that links desired student outcomes to specific educational \"best practices\".  The outcome of this work will be an integrated set of pilot instruments, vetted with a representative cross-section of the engineering community, to assess the current state of instructional practice and student learning outcomes.",
