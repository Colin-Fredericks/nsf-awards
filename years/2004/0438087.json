 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this workshop is to bring together the PIs and Co-PIs currently funded by the Information and Data Management Program of the National Science Foundation to discuss and exchange ideas on the focus topics of their field, as well as to identify and elaborate on emerging themes and particular emphases for future activities. \r\n\r\nMore specifically, the researchers, along with selected industry and government invitees, cooperatively focused on: \r\n\r\n(1) analyzing research and development issues fundamental in making progress towards new challenges imposed by such diverse data sources as the Internet, embedded and distributed sensors, and satellites; \r\n\r\n(2) specifying areas where major breakthroughs appear possible and needed; and \r\n\r\n(3) identifying collaborations (e.g., inter-disciplinary, academic-industry) and research initiatives and facilities needed to meet current and future challenges. \r\n\r\nIn addition, workshop participants shared their current research activities and accomplishments, provided demonstrations, and in general, interacted with each other and explored potential fruitful collaborations and innovative synergisms. As a result, the workshop findings are expected to influence not only the research agenda and future directions of the Information and Data Management Program of the National Science Foundation but also the technology to be developed for the next decade or so in the ways data and information are used and managed by the community at large. The workshop web site (http://csr.bu.edu/idm2004) will provide access to reports of projects supported by the Information and Data Management Program, workshop presentations and workshop findings.\r\n",
