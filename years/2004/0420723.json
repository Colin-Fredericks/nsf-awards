This instrument will help strengthen on going research collaboration using complementary techniques of FTIR and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) for materials and process characterization established in the physics department at Texas State.  The research includes investigations of novel materials and processes that have potential applications in manufacturing of semiconductors and other devices.  In all cases, the high quality spatial resolution of the AFM gives us insight into processes that occur on small scales on the surface of the material.  However, the understanding of these processes is blind without the additional chemical information that can be obtained with FTIR.  Acquisition of these instruments will provide significant opportunities to increase the level of undergraduate involvement and course curriculum involvement with both instruments.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Major Research Instrumentation program provides funds to Southwest Texas State University for acquisition of a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR).
