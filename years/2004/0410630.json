 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Science (61) The goal of this project is to implement a new laboratory experience that will enhance the ability of students to excel in upper-level courses that incorporate research-based laboratories, as well as to enable them to participate in faculty-mentored research earlier in their careers.  To accomplish these goals the PI team is redesigning the laboratory portion of Cell Biology, a lecture and laboratory-based course that is the first class for biology majors.  The new course is strengthening student skills in instrumentation and scientific investigation because all laboratory exercises include an analytical and investigative component.  The lab is also improving the ability of students to maintain laboratory notebooks and to write by incorporating writing experiences in all laboratory exercises.  Finally the course provides students with enhanced pre-laboratory training and continued access to web-based laboratory manuals and training modules that can be used both by students in the course and as refreshers by upper-class students throughout their careers.  Technology is being used for both the delivery of the materials and by integrating equipment, data analysis, and writing into the cell biology environment.",
