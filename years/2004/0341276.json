 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pair programming transforms a traditionally solitary activity into a collaborative one. In pair programming, software is developed by two programmers working at a single computer workstation. However, some students have difficulty pairing due to the collocation requirement. The PI has developed a tool that allows pair programmers to work from separate locations. This tool will enhance the educational infrastructure, and permit more students to enjoy the benefits of pair programming. Removing the collocation limitation of pair programming will encourage more educators to allow their students to pair. This project will evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in an introductory programming course. It is expected that students who are allowed to use this tool will spend less time working alone, and will have better working relationships with their partners than those who must physically meet to pair.",
