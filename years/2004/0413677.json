 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two of the major threats to freshwater ecosystems worldwide include water diversions and exotic species.  Scientists working with natural resource managers are developing methods for restoring stream ecosystems and evaluating whether native species, including fish and invertebrates will respond positively to restoration actions.  This research uses Fossil Creek, Arizona as a model system for studying whether restoration actions can restore native food webs.  Upcoming restoration projects include returning full flows by decommissioning a large hydropower dam and chemical removal of exotic fish.  This study will combine fish and invertebrate surveys with stable isotope analysis of food web structure prior to and following the restoration treatments to evaluate whether rivers can be restored following a century of disturbance.  Results from this case study will be applicable to other large restoration projects throughout the country.\r\n",
