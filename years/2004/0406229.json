 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research project is to develop new adaptive\r\nsampling designs and inference methods for sampling in network and\r\nspatially structured populations.  Adaptive sampling designs are those\r\nin which the procedure for selecting the sample can depend on values\r\nof variables of interest observed during the survey.  In spatial\r\nsettings, that can mean adaptively adding new units to the sample in\r\nthe vicinity of high or otherwise interesting observed values.  In\r\nnetwork or graph settings, links can be adaptively followed from\r\ninteresting sample nodes to add new nodes to the sample.  A variety of\r\nnew sampling procedures, together with design and model based\r\nestimation methods, will be investigated in the study.  A new,\r\nflexible and versatile class of adaptive designs, termed ``active set\r\nadaptive sampling,'' was found during the preliminary work toward this\r\nproject.  Designs in this class have certain advantages over adaptive\r\ncluster sampling and some of the traditional network sampling designs\r\nin being more flexible, allowing for control of total sample size and\r\nnot requiring complete inclusion of connected components.\r\nDesign-unbiased estimates are possible with some of these designs,\r\nproviding inferences that are robust against assumptions about the\r\npopulation.  These designs lend themselves toward model-based\r\ninferences as well and can be used in some situations to help ensure\r\nthat the assumptions for the model-based inferences are met.  This\r\nproject will advance the theory and methodology of adaptive sampling\r\nand in particular will fully investigate and develop several\r\ncategories of new adaptive sampling designs within this class and\r\ndevelop and evaluate design and model based inference methods for use\r\nwith adaptive designs of all types.\r\n\r\nWith adaptive sampling designs, the study design can change in\r\nresponse to the values and patterns observed during the study.  For\r\nexample, in a study of an at-risk hidden human population, social\r\nlinks from particularly high-risk individuals can be followed to add\r\nmore individuals to the sample; in a survey of an unevenly distributed\r\nnatural resource, new observations may be adaptively made in\r\nneighborhoods of high observed abundance.  In previous work it has\r\nbeen established that in many situations the theoretically optimal\r\nsampling strategy is an adaptive one.  Specific adaptive designs, such\r\nas the adaptive cluster sampling designs developed in a previous\r\nproject, have been shown to give substantial gains in precision or\r\nefficiency over conventional strategies for certain types of\r\npopulations, in particular rare, clustered ones.  The results of the\r\nproposed research will provide research tools for other scientific\r\nfields, including the biological, environmental, health, and social\r\nsciences.  Each of these fields has to deal with populations that are\r\ndifficult to sample by conventional means because of their\r\nunpredictably uneven spatial and network structures.  The sampling\r\nmethods resulting from this project have applications to many\r\nsituations of importance to society, including studies of hidden\r\npopulations such as those at risk for HIV/AIDS, environmental\r\nassessment and monitoring, biological surveys, natural resources\r\nexplorations and inventories, Internet surveys, rapid response to\r\nnatural and induced health threats, studies in human social behavior,\r\nand archaeological studies.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
