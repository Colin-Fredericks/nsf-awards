Very much like mechanical switches the \"1\" and \"0\" states of the memory is given by the presence (i.e., high conductance) state or lack (i.e., low conductance) state of a metallic wire between the electrodes. The proposed devices have a simple \"cross-bar\" geometry that makes them ideal for very large scale integration with high yield. Non-volatile memories are an integral part of \"embedded systems\" with growing  importance in emerging systems where operating systems are stored in non-volatile memories for easy updating.\r\n\r\nThere are many other applications of the proposed studies in self-organized and forced assembly of nano-objects self-healing and programmable interconnects and break junctions and in weakly-coupled quantum particles for sensing  and information processing. The proposed devices can be used to study and demonstrate  real-time growth of wires with fractal geometry in optically transparent solid electrolyte  films with interesting and important quantized electrical properties.\r\n",
