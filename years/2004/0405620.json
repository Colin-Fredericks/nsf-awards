 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a nanomagnetism collaboration that involves researchers from New York University and IBM, Yorktown Heights, NY. The aim is to further understand and apply nanoscale spin-transfer devices and materials. In miniature magnetic devices an electrical current can transport spin angular momentum between magnetic layers and produce magnetic reversal as well as magnetic excitations. This may enable rapid and coherent reversal in nanomagnets with large magnetic anisotropy -- a reversal that would otherwise require large local magnetic fields. This is important to increasing magnetic information storage density. This project will address important fundamental questions about the nature of the interaction between the current and the magnetization through studies of new device structures and materials. An essential component is the application of a new batch-fabricated nanostencil-substrate methodology to enable the rapid prototyping of multilayer structures with nanometer scale lateral dimensions (<100 nm). This research will be integrated with the training of young scientists: Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this collaboration will gain by interactions between academia and industry and through the many planned student exchanges between NYU and IBM. High school students (with interests in Intel Science Research) will also participate in this research.\r\n\r\nThis project brings together researchers from New York University and IBM with the aim of furthering the understanding and application of nanometer scale magnetic devices and materials. Magnetic nanostructures are widely used in technology with the most advanced applications found in information processing. This is a significant industry in the United States that is growing rapidly, with ever-increasing worldwide demands for data processing and storage. It has recently been discovered that in miniature magnetic devices a direct electrical current can switch the direction of magnetization by a mechanism know as spin-transfer. This is an exciting development that may enable dramatic improvements in magnetic information processing and storage. There are many important and fundamental questions about the nature of the interaction between the current and magnetization that this project will address through the investigation of new device structures and materials. This research will be integrated with the training of young scientists in this forefront area of magnetism research. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this collaboration will gain by interactions between academia and industry and through the many planned exchanges between NYU and IBM. High school students (with interests in Intel Science Research) will also participate in this research.\r\n",
