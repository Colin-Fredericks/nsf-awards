Van Doren\r\n\r\nThis project includes an active multicultural science student recruiting program, incentive scholarships, tutoring, professional and peer mentoring, internships, student teaching stipends, student membership in professional societies, and travel to regional and national meetings. It will more than double the average number of science majors graduating each year with baccalaureate degrees. The objective is to graduate students who \"do science.\"\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This project addresses both the need for science graduates who are ready to do science and the need to provide financial incentives and support for college students that are struggling in their pursuit of a science degree. It includes a comprehensive support structure to help science students succeed as well as research internships that will prepare them to be research scientists.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: An increase in science baccalaureate degrees would positively impact local shortages of science professionals. The Yakima Valley has a wealth of undeveloped science talent in its youth who need certified science teachers who also know their students' cultures. Local schools have large numbers of Hispanic and Native American students. This project will place science teacher graduates within local hard-to-staff schools, as role models and professionals. These teachers will encourage more youth to succeed in science earlier in their scholastic careers and be prepared for college.",
