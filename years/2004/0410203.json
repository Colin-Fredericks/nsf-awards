Most of today's software --- operating systems, runtime systems, and applications --- naively treats an SMT as a conventional multiprocessor.  Thus, today's SMT-equipped computers do not fully unfold their potential.\r\n\r\nThis proposal focuses on a synergistic approach combining runtime and operating system support to fully exploit the capabilities of SMTs. To meet this objective, this project stud-ies three different approaches.  First, it investigates the benefits of using a helper thread along side the primary thread, by building a reference implementation of an SMT-aware Message Passing Interface (MPI) library.  Second, this project investigates the benefits of dynamic mode switching an application between single-thread and multi-threaded con-figurations.  Third, it modifies the operating system creating an SMT-aware scheduler.  Benefits of this work are demonstrated for a variety of applications, including large-scale benchmarks and other nationally relevant parallel codes.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this work is in three main areas.  First, both PIs are working to create an inter-disciplinary educational and research program.  Second, students will be educated in the interaction between distributed systems, operating systems, and\r\narchitecture.  Finally, the proposed work allows for technology transfer to a wide arena of fields, such as server-style computing, cluster computing, and massively parallel comput-ing.  The developed framework and tools will be made generally available to the research\r\ncommunity and labs.\r\n\r\nDr. Brett D. Fleisch\r\nProgram Director, CISE/CNS\r\nMay 28, 2004\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
