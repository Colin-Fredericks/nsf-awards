Self-assembling systems is a multidisciplinary research field encompassing biology, chemistry, physics, and material and chemical engineering. This workshop will bring together leading researchers, as well as several junior researchers and graduate students, to discuss current developments in the field. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will include research presentations and discussion on fundamental topics related to molecular self-organization as well as selected applications, including nanomaterials, drug delivery, and biomaterials. The presentations will be organized within three topical areas: 1. Self-Assembly of Peptides and Polynucleotides 2. Lipid and Surfactant Self-Assembly 3. Biomimetic Polymer Self-Assembly.  Approximately 25 oral presentations will be divided among these topics, and a general poster session will also be scheduled.\r\n",
