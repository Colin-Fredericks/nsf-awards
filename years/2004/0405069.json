 "awd_abstract_narration": "Just as energy was a dominant factor for activity and change in the twentieth century, so information and infrastructure appear as change agents of the twenty-first century along with the participant roles associated with them. Growing interdisciplinary practices and changing work roles influence data and information delivery in a range of organizational scenarios from the research institution to a project community such as the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network. A growing understanding of the influence of sociotechnical factors prompts this project's response to the challenges of understanding the interdependencies of information and infrastructure in support of science. The field of information science in all its varied forms (bioinformatics, ecoinformatics, social informatics, ocean informatics, organizational informatics) addresses questions of data management, organizational scaling, and interdisciplinary bridging relevant to infrastructure design. The Palmer LTER Antarctic marine site research team with information management embedded within local institutions as well as within the LTER community provides a unique opportunity to begin thinking broadly about questions of 'how to infrastructure'. This project addresses the issue of establishing cross discipline communications and fulfilling the NSF cyberinfrastructure goals that call for social scientists working constructively with scientists and technologists. The aim of this project is contribute findings to ongoing dialogues about sociotechnical issues within the partnered communities. This proposal addresses infrastructure design by broadening the technical research perspective in collaboration with ongoing research programs at multiple levels. The approach integrates a theoretical exploration of interdisciplinary grounded in ethnographic analysis with developing procedures for formative evaluations of cyberinfrastructure development using ethnographic methods developed in the Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Participatory Design communities. Conceptual frameworks will broaden to include assessment issues as they are developing within social informatics and scientific collaboratory research today. This work will enrich the development of Palmer LTER information management design strategies with respect to metadata and databases as well as the associated education outreach programs. In terms of broader impacts, this collaborative effort serves as a unique bridge for information science, social science, and ocean science in support of scientific research over the long-term. There is growing work on understanding failed information system deployments and in expanding technology interface dialogues beyond the computer supported cooperative work applied within the medical and business domains. Given trends toward automation and integration within the scientific arena with the recent focus on building scientific ontologies and interoperable systems, this proposal considers both existing and new work practices as well as works to identify and articulate transition mechanisms pertinent across multiple fields. Research into sociotechnical issues is critical today given the scientific trends to scale up infrastructure, information systems, and scientific partnerships.",
