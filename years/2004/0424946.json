 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves laboratory investigations of the mechanisms of selected heterogeneous reactions on surfaces selected as surrogates for atmospheric mineral aerosols.  Studies will be performed as a function of relative humidity to quantify the effect of water vapor on the adsorption and reaction rates and mechanisms.  A variety of analytical techniques will be employed to measure the uptake of gaseous species and identify the absorbed intermediate compounds.  Isotopic labeling will be used as an additional tool to verify reaction pathways.\r\n\r\nThis research project will entrain a number of undergraduate students at this RUI (Research at an Undergraduate) Institution.  This will be the institution's first summer research program in chemistry.  Since the population of the university is predominately female, it is likely that this project will provide a supportive research environment for a number of female students, and thereby increase interest in the chemical sciences, where they are underrepresented.  The equipment acquisitions will lead to improved instrumental infrastructure in the chemistry department.",
