 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ongoing research at Cornell University and the Cornell Center for Materials Research (CCMR) will greatly benefit by the addition of a MALDI/TOF mass spectrometer to the CCMR's Shared Experimental Facilities.  Research groups in a number of departments will take advantage of this useful instrument and its ability to obtain accurate mass spectral data for a wide array of materials, including organic-inorganic composites, polymers, dendrimers, textiles, and peptides.  A wide variety of interdisciplinary research fronts will be explored with the help of MALDI/TOF mass spectrometry.  These endeavors include:  (a) the development of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs); (b) surface structure and phase behavior of polymers and macromolecules; (c) immune receptor signaling; (d) environmentally friendly polymers and plastics, (d) cellulose dissolution and processing; (e) peptide-dye conjugates as biosensors; (f) fiber morphology and structure; (g) photopolymer and photoresist development; (h) polymerization processes and organic-inorganic hybrids; and (i) nanoparticles and mesoporous materials.\r\n\r\nThe geographic location of the Cornell University campus relative to other major research institutions and metropolitan areas imparts a growing need for on-campus, centrally located analytical instrumentation for all departments, units, colleges, and affiliated businesses.  Access to the CCMR's Shared Experimental Facilities to regional colleges and universities allows for intensive research collaborations to be fostered among the Cornell faculty and those appointed at other schools and departments.  The acquisition of a state-of-the-art MALDI/TOF mass spectrometer on the campus will greatly benefit the many researchers working at or with Cornell University that are involved in materials science research and instruction.\r\n",
