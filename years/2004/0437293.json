Moses of the Wolfson Centre for Magnetics and Technology at the University of Cardiff addresses investigations in the magnetic and magneto elastic properties of a new class of magneto elastic composite materials.  The proposal adds an international dimension to an existing NSF grant in materials research. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit  The investigators plan to conduct materials characterization measurements using state-of-the-art facilities at the Wolfson Centre. The investigators are focusing on hysteresis (loss of magnetism) -  a problem common to composite magnetic materials.  They will study the magneto mechanical properties in order to understand their function and to produce materials with the desired properties of low hysteresis loss and high stress sensitivity. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts  In addition to the scientific research proposed here, the project also has a strong educational and training component. Through the international dimension, U.S. graduate students and a postdoctoral research will have an opportunity to learn about magnetic materials characterization methods being developed at the University of Cardiff using their state-of-the-art facilities.   They will have developed research experience with an international team.  There are plans to integrate the research results into an instructional course on magnetic materials and to involve undergraduate researchers through Iowa State's NSF-sponsored Research for Undergraduates Site.\r\n",
