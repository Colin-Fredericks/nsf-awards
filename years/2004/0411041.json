 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sociology (86)\r\n\r\nThis project is adapting the Integrating Data Analysis (IDA) approach to undergraduate education that has been developed by the American Sociological Association and the Social Science Data Analysis Network.  The IDA project is designed to address the scientific literacy gap among undergraduate students in sociology by incorporating data modules into non-research methods courses.  In working with these data modules, students engage in investigative research and gain experience testing hypotheses and interpreting statistical data. The proposed project is incorporating a variety of well-designed research experiences into a range of sociology classes from the introductory ones through the most advanced electives. The common thread that defines this approach to sociology is that students are engaging in empirical research and critically evaluating data throughout their college program.  Our adaptation of the IDA approach is meeting the special needs of a teaching-oriented sociology program with a high student/faculty ratio, large enrollments by non-sociology majors, and a substantial number of evening and weekend students at a non-residential Hispanic-serving and minority-serving institution. \r\n \r\n",
