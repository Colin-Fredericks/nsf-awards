One project focuses on the wave equation on singular spaces;\r\ntogether with Melrose, the PI has shown that in general, a singularity of\r\na solution to the wave equation interacts with a cone point to produce a\r\n\"diffracted\" spherical wavefront emanating from the cone point.  The\r\nsingularity of the diffracted front may be weaker than that of the\r\nincident front if the latter is not too precisely focused on the cone\r\npoint.  Melrose and the PI hope to generalize these results to more\r\ncomplex singular geometries, perhaps eventually to include a large class\r\nof stratified spaces.  Another direction of research involves the\r\nSchroedinger equation on noncompact manifold endowed with \"scattering\"\r\nmetrics (e.g. short-range perturbations of Euclidean spaces).  Together\r\nwith Hassell and Tao, the PI is involved in a project to prove sharp\r\nStrichartz estimates for the Schroedinger equation in this geometric\r\nsetting.  Hassell and the PI also hope to provide a precise description of\r\nthe propagator for the Schroedinger equation, extending an earlier result\r\nwhich yielded part of its Schwartz kernel.\r\n\r\nA central question in the mathematical theory of quantum mechanics is:  \r\nwhat is the relationship between the classical dynamics of a particle and\r\nits corresponding quantum states?  Insights into this problem have come\r\nnot only from the direct study of the quantum mechanical energy operator\r\nor \"Hamiltonian\" itself, but also from studying a host of other\r\nfundamental equations involving it, such as the heat equation, the wave\r\nequation, and, naturally, the time-dependent Schroedinger equation.  The\r\nfocus of the PI's research is thus the geometric analysis of several kinds\r\nof partial differential equations.  One project investigates what happens\r\nto waves as they interact with (a certain generalization of) sharp\r\ncorners---the geometry of how wavefronts move can be quite subtle in these\r\ncases owing to the effects of diffraction.  Another project is to study\r\nthe structure of solutions of the Schroedinger equation on unbounded\r\nspaces; such solutions describe the time-evolution of a quantum particle.  \r\nA related focus of research is to obtain certain estimates of solutions to\r\nthe Schroedinger equation in order to improve our understanding the\r\nnonlinear Schroedinger equation, which arises in nonlinear optics and the\r\ntheory of Bose-Einstein condensates, among other physical applications.\r\n",
