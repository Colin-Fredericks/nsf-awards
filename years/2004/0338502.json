 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will perform research aimed at improved detection levels and characterization of inclusions in critical titanium alloy components. Labeled as either low-density or high-density inclusions, these titanium defects can significantly impact fracture-critical airframe structures and jet engine components, resulting in catastrophic failures. The non-destructive detection of hard alpha inclusions in titanium alloys is currently limited to relatively large inclusions that are on or near the component surface, resulting in high potential for missed defects. Photon Induced Positron Annihilation (PIPA) analysis will be developed to detect these inclusions early in the manufacturing process at any location in the casting, and evaluated as a field use NDI technology that can be used to assess damage buildup in operational aircraft components. \r\n\r\nResearch and development in the area of hard alpha inclusion detection using Photon Induced Positron Annihilation has broad impacts in the aerospace industry, in addition to other industries where titanium is used. Development of this technology has primary implications relative to improved aircraft safety and in the maintenance, surveillance, and replacement of highly expensive aerospace components. With improved knowledge of titanium inclusion damage effects, many current costs in the areas of inspection and component replacement can be substantially reduced. With the increasing usage of titanium in many multi-billion dollar industries, PIPA detection of inclusion damage will become increasingly important to the overall titanium and related industries.",
