 "awd_abstract_narration": "Moll\r\n0409968\r\n\r\nMany problems in physics and engineering require the exact\r\nevaluation of integrals in terms of parameters appearing in those\r\nintegrals.  These problems come up in the study of particle\r\nphysics and classical mechanics. While it is not always possible\r\nto find analytic expressions, the investigator and his colleagues\r\nstudy questions that appear in the development of an efficient\r\nand robust symbolic software package that should give such\r\nresults in closed form, or decide whether such an expression is\r\nachievable.  The investigator's goal is to develop algorithms\r\nthat expand upon the capabilities of existing software pacakages\r\nthat are widely used in industry and universities.  The\r\ninvestigator's efforts are concentrated in two classes: rational\r\nfunctions, and elementary functions related to the Hurwitz zeta\r\nfunction.  The study of this last class has produced a new\r\napproach to conjectures on the so-called multiple zeta values and\r\nthe cloed-form evaluation of Tornheim-Zagier sums.\r\n\r\nThe problem of definite integration of special functions started\r\nin the eighteen century with the work of J. Bernoulli.  The\r\nknowledge developed from this problem has been central in many\r\nparts of analysis and applied mathematics.  The development of\r\nhighly sophisticated symbolic languages during the last part of\r\nthe 20th century has required further study of this old problem. \r\nThe investigator and his colleagues are developing the\r\nmathematical theory that is needed for the symbolic evaluation of\r\nthese integrals.  It is a surprising fact that this endevour has\r\nconnections with many areas of mathematics.  The investigator\r\ndevelops new algorithms that ensure the efficiency and robustness\r\nof the current symbolic languages available to the scientific\r\ncommunity.\r\n",
