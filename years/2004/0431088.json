 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the wireless revolution is to provide ubiquitous tetherless connectivity and access to information.\r\nThe last decade has seen great progress towards this goal with cellular phones and wireless LAN cards\r\nnow being commonplace. In particular, space-time processing, spurred by the use of multiple antenna\r\narrays, has emerged as a key enabler of wireless technology. Notwithstanding recent advances in wireless\r\ncommunications research and technology, the state-of-the-art is far from realizing the capacity of wireless\r\nnetworks because of significant gaps in our fundamental understanding of the shared physical wireless\r\nchannel. The key challenges posed by the wireless channel are due to its dispersive nature in time, frequency\r\nand space resulting from physical signal propagation over multiple spatially distributed paths. This motivates\r\nthe central questions at the heart of this project:\r\nWhat are the key factors that govern reliable communication over dispersive wireless channels?\r\nWhat are the fundamental limits on communication over dispersive wireless channels?\r\nWhat are the key principles that guide practical system design?\r\nWe will leverage a novel framework based on a virtual representation of physical wireless channels to\r\naddress these multi-faceted questions. The virtual representation is a powerful deconstructing tool for unraveling\r\nthe rich structure underlying dispersive wireless channels. As we demonstrate in this proposal,\r\nthe insights afforded by the virtual representation framework have deep and wide ranging implications in\r\nthe design and analysis of wireless communication systems. Within this framework, our proposed research\r\nprogram has three broad integrated thrusts:\r\n",
