 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator will host the Sixteenth International Conference on Domain Decomposition Methods in New York City in January 2005. Domain decomposition, in some form, is by far the most common paradigm for large-scale simulation on massively parallel distributed, hierarchical memory computers. However, many users of domain decomposition do not avail themselves of the most sophisticated and efficient methods known. This is especially true as the size of the large-scale scientific simulation community has grown rapidly with the availability of hardware in the past few years inside of scientific communities without traditionally strong ties to the computational mathematics or computer science communities. \r\n\r\nThe sixteenth conference in this series will have a high impact for the large-scale simulation community. The ultimate goal of the conference is to promote advances in domain decomposition methods by encouraging interdisciplinary technical interchange throughout the international computational science & engineering community and by taking advantage of conference siting to attract to this important area many new U.S. scientists.",
