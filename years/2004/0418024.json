 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research explores the mechanisms, and associated factors, by which local institutions  for the management of natural resources successfully adapt to changes in important features  of the external environment, namely, demographic change, market integration, technological  progress, shifts in state policies, and political competition. Existing theoretical understanding  of common property institutions, particularly at the local level, has been preoccupied with  internal features of the institutions that are associated with cooperative behavior, largely  ignoring the larger context or holding it constant. This project contributes to theory  development by expanding the scope of the theory of institutions to include changes in the  external environment over time.  \r\n Intellectual merit: The interaction between local institutions and the external environment  over a long period of time has never been studied systematically before. The impact of  population and markets have been explored to some extent, but analysis of the role of  technology and state policies has been restricted to their influence on the resources, without  explicit reference to local institutional arrangements. Political competition has not been  considered to be an important factor in the performance of local institutions for natural  resource management till now. This project is the first attempt to explore changes in all the  relevant features of the external environment simultaneously, within a unified analytical  framework. In another theoretical contribution, it seeks to empirically clarify and  theoretically engage the concept of institutional resilience . the ability of institutions to adapt  to changes in the external environment. The research design combines qualitative and  inductive analysis of contextual factors with quantitative and time-series analysis of  institutions, providing greater theoretical leverage over causal inference. The project will  create a framework for the comparative analysis of institutions for the management of  different resource types . forests and irrigation . that would be exportable to other locations  and contexts, and create a dataset for over 100 institutions for future reference. \r\n  Broader impacts: More than sixty developing countries have initiated decentralization  policies in the 1990s that devolve management authority to local/village institutions over  multiple domains, including drinking water, primary education, public health, and small  infrastructure development, besides forests, fisheries, and irrigation. Inevitably, the external  environment in which these institutions are expected to perform is changing steadily,  whereas social scientists and policymakers do not have the theoretical tools and operational  instruments to equip institutions to adapt to these changes. Better appreciation of the factors  that contribute to institutional resilience has the potential to enhance the quality of policy- making and implementation. Much of the literature on democratization in developing  countries has ignored environmental issues, just as the literature on environmental politics  has almost totally neglected democratic politics. By incorporating the influence of  democratic competition on the functioning of local institutions for natural resource  management, this research project initiates the building of a bridge between the two  literatures, leading to a better appreciation of the challenges in environmental management  in new and broadening democracies. The theoretical lessons from this research would also  be applicable to similar questions in other domains, such as public goods provision, political  decentralization, and fiscal federalism.   \r\n",
