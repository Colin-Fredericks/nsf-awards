 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nWe propose a three-phase plan to gather and document novel thinking about the role of \r\ncommunity in determining and supporting effective mathematics and science education in \r\nindigenous communities. We will convene an eclectic international group of innovators who \r\nhave developed deep sensibilities about the social ideals, values, and behavioral standards that \r\nhave shaped local approaches to successful schooling in mathematics and science. Each member \r\nwill have a depth of experience thinking .outside the box. and creating successful innovations \r\nthat make a meaningful difference in real communities. This shared experience of striving to \r\ndevelop solutions (against the odds) forms a common thread that we believe will help \r\nparticipants interweave their perspectives and intentions as a group.with a focus on articulating \r\na set of truly transformative ideas about how community involvement in indigenous education \r\ncan help all children learn mathematics and science. \r\nIn Phase I, a small but representative international Working Group of primarily \r\nindigenous mathematics and science educators and researchers will convene in a five-day long \r\ninstitute. Deliberations will center on the role of community in determining and supporting \r\neducation by navigating tensions among traditional/western mathematics and \r\nscience/knowledge/approaches, culturally responsive curriculum, teacher preparation/cultural \r\norientation, language revitalization and language maintenance, the indigenous research agenda, \r\nalternative assessment models, and technical assistance/support structures. Participants will \r\nreport on their own work and come together for in-depth discussions in smaller work groups \r\naround specified sub-themes. By the end of the meeting, the Working Group will develop an \r\nagenda and plan of action that will guide future activities.  \r\nIn Phase II, a nominated council of up to four individuals from the Working Group, will \r\nattend selected national meetings in mathematics, science, and indigenous education, and via a \r\nseries of interactive workshops, panels, and/or individual presentations, introduce the Working \r\nGroup.s vision and agenda, and elicit contributions from educators and community members \r\nsimilarly engaged in community-driven education.  \r\nIn Phase III, two members of the Working Group will attend the triennial World \r\nIndigenous People.s conference, which hosts peoples from around the world who are committed \r\nto achieving reform and transformation of education. Working Group participants will offer \r\nworkshops at this conference and seek counsel and input from this further extended group \r\ninvolved in like-minded efforts. A web-based interactive community will remain in place during \r\nall phases of the work to facilitate ready connection and communication. \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit: A growing group of knowledgeable mathematics and science educators and \r\nothers who will continue to work toward defining indigenous ways of knowing and educational \r\nphilosophies, inspire growing dialogues in uses of indigenous knowledge in schooling, and \r\nstimulate increased integration of indigenous knowledge in educational curriculum.  \r\n \r\nBroad Impacts: Learnings will contribute to the emerging international body of scholarly work \r\nthat delineates ways in which local cultural context fosters academic success in mathematics and \r\nscience for all students. \r\n \r\n",
