 "awd_abstract_narration": "0408895\r\nSilliman\r\n\r\nThis work examines the transport behavior of LNAPLs in the region bounding the\r\nwater table. Defined as the Partially Saturated Fringe, or PSF (Berkowitz et al., 2003),\r\nthe region bounding the water table includes the classic Capillary Fringe (CF) and the\r\nregion below the water table in which multiple phases (air, water, and/or LNAPL) are\r\npresent. This work builds on prior work within our laboratory on Air Entry Barriers (e.g.,\r\nSilliman et al., 2002; Dunn and Silliman, 2003; Dunn et al., 2003) as well as the\r\nsubstantial literature on LNAPL behavior (e.g., Nambi and Powers, 2000; Illangasekare\r\net al., 1995a,b; Schroth et al., 1998; Walser et al., 1999; Van Dijke and Van Der Zee,\r\n1997). Of particular interest for the present study is the interaction of the structure of\r\nheterogeneity and the distribution / dissolution of LNAPLs under conditions of a\r\nfluctuating water table. The work is based on a combination of two-dimensional\r\nlaboratory and numerical experiments on the distribution of pure- and dissolved-phase\r\nLNAPL in a two-zone porous medium (coarse sand and fine sand). Within the\r\nlaboratory, visual and TDR techniques will be used to monitor LNAPL saturation. Mass\r\nof dissolved-phase LNAPL constituents will be monitored at the outflow from the porous\r\nmedia. Numerical experiments will be performed on simulated random and scaled\r\nporous media and T2VOC, an extension of TOUGH2 [Transport Of Unsaturated\r\nGroundwater and Heat, version II], developed at Lawrence Berkeley National\r\nLaboratory. These experiments will be based on generating a series of realizations of\r\nrandom distributions of the coarse and fine sands (based on both stationary random\r\npermeability distributions and structured permeability distributions), followed by\r\nsimulation of a fluctuating water table with significant LNAPL phase above the original\r\nwater table. The laboratory experiments will be utilized to verify LNAPL behavior as\r\npredicted by the numerical model, as well as to provide visualization of LNAPL\r\nbehavior. The numerical model will be utilized to address the central hypotheses:\r\nThe degree of connectivity (defined within the proposal) of coarse sand lenses\r\nwithin a fine sand matrix will influence the amount of LNAPL entrapped within\r\nthe PSF. Specifically, as the connectivity of the coarse regions increases (with the\r\nsame relative volume of coarse and fine sands), the volume of entrapped LNAPL\r\nwill decrease.\r\n An increase in the degree of connectivity of coarse sand lenses within a fine sand\r\nmatrix will result in a reduced overall rate of dissolution of LNAPL entrapped\r\nwithin the PSF.\r\nIn terms of intellectual merit, this work advances the understanding of controls of\r\nLNAPL distribution and dissolution in the PSF. From a theoretical standpoint, this\r\nprovides greater insight into the impact of physical structure on transport characteristics\r\nnear the water table. From an applied standpoint, extension of this work holds promise\r\nfor innovative means of remediation of LNAPL contaminated systems.\r\nIn terms of broader impact, this work will provide training for one Ph.D. and one\r\nMasters student, as well as contributing to undergraduate and graduate courses in\r\ngroundwater hydrology and remediation. In addition, this work will aid in further\r\ndevelopment of research collaborations with colleagues in western Africa (Benin).",
