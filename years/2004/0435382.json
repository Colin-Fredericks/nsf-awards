The basic problem is that it is difficult to deploy new protocols widely enough for testing purposes. In response, this project uses a novel approach (Measurement-Driven Protocol Design) that combines large-scale measurements of the Internet with the design of new protocols. Large-scale measurements enable accurate emulation- and simulation-based evaluation of protocol behavior and, thus, are the key to doing the \"what if\" analysis for many protocol designs. This measure-to-evaluate approach enables the project to make significant contributions to the areas of protocol and system design. \r\n\t\r\nThis project develops this new methodology as part a number of specific research thrusts that, in combination, push the state-of-the-art in both standard IP and overlay routing. Specifically, the project expects to make the following major contributions: 1) novel designs for wide-area IP routing incorporating techniques for diagnosing inter-domain routing problems and inter-domain traffic engineering, 2) significant improvements to overlay routing through new streaming multimedia overlay designs and reflector networks optimizations, and 3) optimization of access networks' performance and availability using a novel combination of overlay and IP routing techniques.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the methodology and protocols developed, a significant fraction of the measurements made as part of this research will be made available for research and education. In order to make them available, this project also explores anonymization techniques for network measurements. \r\n",
