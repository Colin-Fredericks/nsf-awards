 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project summary\r\nWe propose the acquisition of a picosecond streak camera system for time-resolved\r\nmeasurements of photoluminescence from semiconductor nanostructures. The equipment will be\r\nlocated in the PIs optics laboratory in Ginzton, where it would be completely accessible to the\r\nco-PIs and their students residing in the same building, as well as to the interested users from\r\nother research groups around Stanford. Ginzton Laboratory has a strong infrastructure for\r\nnanophotonics research, including state-of-the-art optics laboratories of the investigators and a\r\nshared microfabrication facility. In addition, the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility is located in\r\nthe neighboring building and is extensively used by the investigators. The streak camera will\r\ncomplement the existing capabilities of the PIs and broaden their research in the fields of\r\nnanoscale photonics and quantum information processing, which are already major thrusts in the\r\nGinzton Laboratory. Moreover, the camera will enable research training of a large number of\r\ngraduate and undegraduate students from the research groups of the investigators in performing\r\ntime-resolved spectroscopy and will thus be important in education of a new generation of\r\nscientists who will exploit nanophotonics at its full potential. The PIs also place an emphasis on\r\nresearch training of women and other underrepresented groups; for example, there are usually\r\naround 10 women researchers (mainly experimentalists) across their groups.\r\nThe streak camera system is capable of unprecedented sensitivity in performing time-resolved\r\nphotoluminescence measurements. If the NSF decides to fund this project, the activity that would\r\nresult would be time-resolved study of light emitted from photonic nanostructures (e.g., photonic\r\ncrystal structures) with embedded emitters, such as excitons in quantum dots or quantum well\r\nimpurities. This is crucial for development of novel low-threshold and high-speed lasers and\r\noptical modulators, as well as hardware for emerging technologies such as quantum computation\r\nand quantum communication (e.g., single and entangled photon sources and photon storage\r\ncomponents). PIs are presently leading research programs focused on quantum information\r\nprocessing in the optical domain and on development of optical interconnects; these programs\r\nwould also greatly benefit from the acquisition of the proposed equipment.",
