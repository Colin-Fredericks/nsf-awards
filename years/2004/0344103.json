 "awd_abstract_narration": "This symposium is part of the Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior 5th International meeting being held in Mozine, France in January 4-9, 2004.  Funding will enable trainees and scientists from the United States to maximize their interactions with European investigators interested in Behavioral Neuroscience and Neuroendocrinology.  The program includes participants with expertise in neuroendocrinology, animal behavior, and developmental biology. The symposium will engage both senior and junior ranked scientists in discussions focusing on the pharmacology and biochemistry of reproductive behavior and cognitive function. Participants in this program will include undergraduate students, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty. The symposium will engage participants in discussions regarding complex relationships between brain and behavior. Symposia, poster presentations, meet the professor lunches, and organized discussions on international research opportunities will encourage interactions between students, junior scientists, and senior scientists that are internationally recognized for their accomplishments. The organizing committee is committed to fostering the development of young scientists. Funds will help defray travel costs and registration fees for participants to attend the meeting. The impact of this will extend to numerous fields of study, such as neuroendocrinology, behavioral neuroscience, animal behavior, and population biology.  Those trainees receiving travel awards will be asked to evaluate the effectiveness of their experience at this meeting and then these data will be published as an abstract and poster presentation that will take place during the education session at the 2004 Society for Neuroscience meeting.",
