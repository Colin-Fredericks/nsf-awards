 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at Duke University is to experimentally investigate dynamic and quenched disorder in non-equilibrium reaction-diffusion processes, and to further incorporate research experience into the graduate and undergraduate physics curriculum.  Despite the ubiquity and importance of processes involving interaction and transport: e.g. the weather, plasmas, industrial chemical reactions and surface reactions, a quantitative understanding of non-equilibrium processes is fundamentally lacking.  The proposed experiments address open questions in non-equilibrium physics, including studies of the validity of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang model of rough growing interfaces, and tests of whether a critical amount of disorder smooths out a non-equilibrium transition that is otherwise sharp.  These studies will contribute to the development of a predictive theory for non-equilibrium physics. Training of students will focus on their preparation for scientific and non-scientific multidisciplinary careers, while still maintaining the useful perspective and skills provided by a physics program.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project at Duke University is to experimentally investigate dynamic and static disorder in non-equilibrium processes involving interaction and transport, and to further incorporate research experience into the graduate and undergraduate physics curriculum.  Despite the ubiquity and importance of interaction-transport processes: e.g. the weather, plasmas, industrial chemical reactions and surface reactions, a theoretical understanding, i.e. predictive power, of these processes is fundamentally lacking.  The proposed experiments address open questions in non-equilibrium physics, including studies of the validity of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang model of rough growing interfaces, and tests of whether a precise amount of disorder smooths out an otherwise sharp transition between two different system behaviors.  The results of these experiments will contribute to the development of a predictive theory of non-equilibrium systems which will ultimately apply to the research of liquid and solid rocket propellant and other combustion processes; electronic, magnetic, and optical materials fabrication; and bio-geophysical processes; and is likely to apply to a broad range of related phenomena. Training of students will focus on their preparation for scientific and non-scientific multidisciplinary careers, while still maintaining the useful perspective and skills provided by a physics program.",
