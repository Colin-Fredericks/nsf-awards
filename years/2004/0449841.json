 "awd_abstract_narration": "GeoSystems is a developing community-based initiative that focuses on the importance\r\nof the deep-time perspective for understanding the complexities of Earth's atmosphere,\r\nhydrosphere, biosphere and surficial lithosphere using climate as the focus. The GeoSystems\r\ninitiative holds the potential to catalyze rapid and innovative progress in research and education\r\non Earth's climate and related systems, but will require concerted effort in (1) networking with\r\nother initiatives in Geoinformatics (e.g. CHRONOS), to forge alliances on topics of mutual\r\nrelevance and begin to formulate tools appropriate for mining and linking large databases, (2)\r\nbuilding the community of GeoSystems researchers and stimulating collaboration within that\r\ncommunity, and (3) initiating outreach efforts aimed at education in GeoSystems and the role of\r\nGeoinformatics in this effort. To begin to realize these objectives, funds are requested for\r\nworkshops and meetings, and information dissemination via development of the GeoSystems\r\nwebsite and related materials (newsletters, brochures, etc.).\r\nIntellectual Merit--Ultimately, these efforts will augment our understanding of Earth's\r\nclimate and related systems, expanding our grasp of climate-system behavior, thresholds,\r\nfeedbacks, nonlinearity, and positively impacting climate modeling and prediction.\r\nBroader Impact-Planned outreach and education efforts will capitalize on the\r\nremarkable Earth-system couplings and biotic impacts preserved in Earth history, which capture\r\nthe imaginations of all-- the university professor to the grade-schooler-- and thus provide ideal\r\nfodder for science education at all levels.",
