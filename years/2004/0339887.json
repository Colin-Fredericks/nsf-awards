 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses a low cost technology for the mass production of high performance piezoelectric single crystals. The approach will potentially lead to a new generation of engineered piezocrystals exhibiting attributes of low cost, high quality and volume not previously attainable. The proposed technology uses a novel sintering process to overcome conventional limitations to the mechanical strength, size and homogeneity inherent in pure single crystal forms. The approach incorporates a templated grain growth mechanism within the matrix recrystallization process. The plan is to demonstrate highly grain-oriented piezocrystal ceramics with single-crystal-like properties during this program. The success of this technological development will dramatically expedite the transition of new generation piezoelectric devices from laboratory prototypes to their practical deployment in the market.\r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project is in piezoelectric devices. The technology makes possible new piezoelectric devices with improved performance that is beyond current technology. The anticipated targets for these materials include medical ultrasonic diagnostics and therapeutics, active machine tool control, and vibration suppression in HVAC systems. A recent report by the National Science Foundation estimates the U.S. market piezoelectric ceramic materials at ca. $1.5B. The global market is estimated at over $11B.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
