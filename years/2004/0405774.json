 "awd_abstract_narration": "Open maps between topological spaces have been studied extensively\r\nfor many years. For example, Stoilow showed in  early 1900 that\r\neach open and light map of the 2-sphere is a branched covering\r\nmap. However, much less is known about the iterative behavior of\r\nsuch maps. For example it is still not known if every branched\r\ncovering map of the sphere has a fixed point in every proper\r\ninvariant sub-continuum with connected complement. In contrast,\r\nusing mostly analytic techniques, the dynamics of rational maps R\r\nof the sphere are quite well understood. However, the analytic\r\napproach is difficult in certain limit cases (i.e., if R has\r\neither neutral periodic points or recurrent critical points). The\r\nonly case where significant progress was made towards a detailed\r\nanalysis of the dynamics of all continuous functions is for maps\r\nof the unit interval. We believe that significant new results are\r\nalso possible for open (and open-like) maps on other simple spaces\r\n(i.e., manifolds or dendrites) without an analytic or one-to-one\r\nassumption. Some progress in this direction was made for minimal\r\n(not necessarily one-to-one) maps on manifolds and certain\r\ncompositions of open and monotone maps on the sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long term behavior of a system is determined by  a set of\r\nequations and given initial conditions. The system can be\r\ndescribed by a function f, acting on a space X, with a given\r\ninitial value x (the \"state of the system\"). The long term\r\nbehavior of the system can then be described by iteration: the\r\ninitial value x=x(0), the state of the system at time zero, leads\r\nto the value x(1), the state at time one,  which leads to x(2)\r\netc. The limit behavior of the sequence x(0), x(1) describes the\r\nlong term behavior of the system. It is known that, even for very\r\nsimple systems, the long term behavior of the system may be\r\nchaotic. The complexity of the system is governed by the\r\ncomplexity of the space X and the function f. In this research\r\nproject we propose to extend information about the long term\r\nbehavior of systems using more general spaces and a larger class\r\nof functions.\r\n\r\n",
