This facility will consist of two pieces of equipment: one to perform powder wide-angle x-ray diffraction and the  other  to  perform  small-angle  x-ray diffraction.  The equipment will be used to characterize of nanostructured materials: the former will be used to characterize crystal structures, i.e. the arrangement of individual atoms on a sub-\r\nnanometer  scale,  while  the  latter  will  be  used  to  characterize  larger  structures,  i.e.  the arrangement of groups of atoms or molecules on a nanometer or tens of nanometer scale.  These instruments will truly be multi-user pieces of equipment, we have provided brief descriptions of 11 different projects involving 10 different faculty members from 5 different departments.  In \r\naddition,  we  have  listed  titles  of more projects, some of which involve faculty from other universities  in  the  State  of  Oklahoma.    These  instruments  will  become  an  important  part  of Nanonet, an NSF EPSCoR funded center in the State of Oklahoma that encompasses scientists \r\ninterested in nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nFunds are being requested to build a x-ray facility with broad applications to the field of  materials  characterization.  This facility will consist of two pieces of equipment: one to study crystals  and the  other  to  perform  measurements on less structured materials.  The equipment will be used to characterize of materials structured on a very fine scale: the former will be used to characterize crystal structures, i.e. the arrangement of individual atoms, while  the  latter  will  be  used  to  characterize  larger  structures,  i.e.  the arrangement of groups of atoms or molecules.
