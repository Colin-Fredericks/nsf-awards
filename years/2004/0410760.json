 "awd_abstract_narration": "Physics (13) This project restructures the intermediate optics laboratory and lecture courses at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW).  By adopting interactive lecture demonstrations and an interactive engagement approach, students exit the course with a much greater conceptual understanding of optics.  In this project we adapt five major elements.  In lecture we are using interactive lecture demonstrations and simulations adapted from Physlets and other sources.  We are bringing aspects of interactive engagement into both the laboratory and lecture.  From a CCLI project recently completed by one of the Co-PIs we are taking the overall approach and laboratory format.  Many of the initial laboratories are adapted from Tutorials in Physics.  From professional practice we are adapting the process of having students make oral presentations to classmates and department faculty.  Also from professional practice we are adapting LabVIEW and optical simulation software to provide students with important work place experience.  The laboratory provides 10 weeks of concept and skill building experiments investigating geometric optics, image formation and waves.  The remaining five weeks of the laboratory are devoted to more in-depth investigations.  Six advanced experiments are being developed that build on the initial part of the program.  This grant has a great impact on the department, university (IPFW), and surrounding industrial optics and laser community.",
