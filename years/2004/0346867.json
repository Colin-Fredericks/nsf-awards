The framework targets the upcoming generation of \r\nPetaflop-class supercomputers, which are based on architectural substrates \r\nwith multiple levels of on-chip and off-chip parallelism and deep memory \r\nhierarchies. The research addresses the need for increased productivity and \r\nutilization of the National supercomputing power, by attempting to close the \r\ngap between computer architecture innovation and parallel programming \r\npractices. The main goal of this activity is to reduce the \r\nprogramming effort required for mapping algorithmic parallelism to \r\nhierarchical hardware components with heterogeneous means for parallel \r\nexecution and assist programmers in deriving balanced designs of layered parallel applications.  The programming framework \r\ninvestigated in this research unifies parallel programming models and \r\nmethodologies and enables faster adaptation of parallel code to new hardware \r\nplatforms.  Concurrently, it forms a basis for education and training of \r\ninterdisciplinary student audiences in high performance programming. \r\n\r\nThe parallel programming component of this research is designed around \r\nstandard C++ templates with notation for nested threads and iterators. \r\nThe notations for parallelism are coupled with a templated representation of \r\ndata, which allows for arbitrary partitioning, sharing, and coherence control \r\nat multiple levels of parallel execution constructs.  While the  programmer \r\nhighlights nested parallelism, the orchestration and management of multigrain \r\nthreads and data are delegated to the compiler and the runtime system. The \r\nresearch investigates novel methods for controlling the \r\ngranularity of multilevel parallelism via vertical analysis of the program.  \r\nPeriodicity analysis and selective runtime tracing are used as means to \r\nderive effective data distribution and layout schemes without user\r\nintervention. Alongside runtime analysis, new resource-driven scheduling \r\nstrategies and novel microprocessor features, including on-chip \r\nmultithreading, on-chip SIMD parallelism and speculative execution, are \r\nincorporated into the parallelization and program optimization processes. \r\n",
