 "awd_abstract_narration": "As  an  AGEP  program  participant  since  1998,  the  University  of  Michigan  (UM)  proposes  to  build \r\nupon its successes and achievements by forming the Michigan AGEP Alliance (MAA).  Our partnership \r\nwill comprise four leading Ph.D. granting institutions in the State of Michigan, all of which have long-\r\nstanding traditions of academic excellence in doctoral education and research in science and engineering \r\n(STEM) disciplines, as well as a firm commitment to achieving diversity in higher education.  The MAA \r\nwill feature the UM as the lead school, and include Michigan State University, Wayne State University, \r\nand Western Michigan University as primary partners. The UM will share the many successes of its previous AGEP activities with the new partner schools and,  in  turn,  learn from  the  different  experiences  and  insights  that  each  partner  brings  to  the  Alliance.  The  institutionalization  successfully  carried  out  at  the  UM  with  AGEP  funding,  as  well  as  the considerable achievements of our partner institutions, will provide a solid foundation on which to develop new avenues of programming for the proposed MAA.  Our Alliance will be a full partnership of the four institutions,  built  upon  our  collective  wisdom,  the  sharing  of  best  practices,  and  the  assessment  of outcomes and use of this knowledge to implement continuous improvement.  Through the development of joint programs and ventures, the MAA will achieve (1) sustained, organized cooperation between MAA institutions; (2) increased efficiency by aligning the resources and operations of MAA partners; and (3) increased opportunities for under-represented students. \r\nThe primary objectives of the proposed AGEP program are: To sustain and expand upon gains made in the recruitment of under-represented students in the STEM  fields,  by  sharing  lessons  of  UM  successes  with  alliance  institutions  and  by  adapting successful programs from the alliance to UM.s institutional culture. \r\nTo develop and implement new initiatives to expand the student pipeline, to retain and graduate \r\nenrolled students, and to prepare students effectively for entering careers in academia. \r\nTo ensure that students are prepared to become leaders and innovators in the academic world. \r\nTo ensure long-term sustainability of gains made by institutionalizing successes. \r\nThe proposed AGEP program will be centered on a set of programmatic activities that include: \r\nRecruiting and outreach:  recruiting fairs and outreach, coordinated summer research programs, \r\ncoordinated visits of students to partner campus, outreach to potential students in industry. \r\nRetention:  alleviating financial concerns, identifying and finding solutions for academic \r\nconcerns, responding to social concerns, strengthening mentoring, improving programs that \r\nprepare students for entering graduate programs. \r\nDevelopment of student leadership and innovation in STEM fields. \r\nTeaching preparation and career development:  encouragement of academic careers. \r\nIntellectual Merit- Collectively the MAA partners have extensive experience in analyzing data, and \r\nwe propose to develop an evaluation model that will enable us to capitalize on our success and remedy \r\ndifficulties in a timely fashion.  With this model we will measure and analyze in depth outcomes between \r\ndifferent  student  groups,  partner  institutions,  and  other  AGEP  alliances.    We  will  disseminate  the \r\nknowledge  gained  in  a  variety  of  ways,  including  meetings,  presentations,  reports  and  journal \r\npublications.  We intend to create an approach to evaluation that may be adopted in other AGEP alliances, \r\nproducing a wider comparison of effort and success and perhaps setting the groundwork for a national \r\nanalysis standard in graduate education. Broader  Impact-  Our  efforts  will  lead  to  an  increased  number  of  under-represented  students successfully completing a Ph.D., and entering academia.  However, the aim of our AGEP program is not simply to increase numbers, but rather to provide an educational experience, adoptable by other graduate programs, that will enable our under-represented students to become part of the next generation of leaders and innovators in STEM fields.  We will develop a series of programs that will help develop the skills and attitude  students  need  to  become  creative  researchers,  educators  and  leaders,  who will  be  ready  to contribute to the knowledge, technology, security and quality of life of the nation.",
