This proposal will provide\r\ntravel costs, registration costs, and lodging costs to approximately 15\r\nminority undergraduates for the annual meetings of these societies for the\r\nyears 2003 - 2006.  These undergraduates will also present posters at the\r\nmeetings.  The proposal is an outgrowth of a pilot program conducted at\r\nthe 2001 meetings which raised awareness and enthusiasm for the need to\r\nbroaden the undergraduate base at the meetings.  During the meetings the\r\nundergraduates will be mentored by graduate student and faculty mentors,\r\nwho will help the undergraduate network at the meetings, help demystify\r\ntalks for the undergraduates, and generally make the students feel more\r\nwelcome at the meetings.  There will also be an official mentoring session\r\nfor undergraduates, consisting of a 'pep-talk'/seminar that will help\r\nencourage the students to prepare for careers and/or graduate school in\r\nevolutionary/environmental biology.  These activities will be supplemented\r\nby social activities not covered by this grant, as well as further efforts\r\non the part of both societies for encouraging undergraduate participation,\r\nsuch as reduced registration fees, daily fees for attendance by students\r\nat the host site, and an undergraduate poster session.  These activities\r\nwill help increase the amount of minority and other undergraduate\r\nparticipation at the meetings, and ultimately should have a positive\r\neffect on minority participation in evolutionary biology nationally.\r\n\r\n",
