 "awd_abstract_narration": "This series of six studies will examine eyewitness guessing from an objective and a subjective perspective. We seek to understand whether and to what extent different forms of guessing are (differentially) influenced by substantive and procedural manipulations explored in prior eyewitness research and the extent to which RKG judgments by themselves and in combination with other subjective and objective measures, can predict accuracy and account for the effects of substantive and procedural manipulations.  Study 1 is a small-scale meta-analysis that will apply the Penrod (2003) analytic strategy to studies which provide complete information on hits, misses and false alarms in target-present and target-absent lineups together with the rates of false alarms on a designated target look-alike. Study 2 will examine the judgments of individuals who are inclined to make guesses and explore the nature of the \"lost\" accurate identifications that appear to accompany the use of sequential lineups. Study 3 will examine the effects of varying forms of target exposure on the use of Remember/Know/Guess (RKG) judgments. Study 4 focuses on the effects of bias on guessing rates, the ability of the RKG responses to differentiate accurate from inaccurate judgments and the sensitivity of use of RKG to bias manipulations. Study 5 will explore misinformation effects using the RKG paradigm. Study 6 will explore unconscious transference effects using the RKG paradigm.",
