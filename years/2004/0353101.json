 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organizations have knowledge. The knowledge is typically dispersed\r\nthroughout the organization. Some of it is codified in documents and\r\npolicies, some is embodied in projects and strategies, and some is tacitly\r\nheld by individuals and small groups. The problem of knowledge management\r\nis that an organization's knowledge is often locally produced, haphazardly\r\ndisseminated, and ineffectively indexed. It is inaccessible when and where\r\nit is needed. Knowledge management techniques take a participatory approach\r\nto identifying, codifying, and integrating knowledge resources throughout\r\nthe organization. Their objective is to help people make sense of their\r\norganizations, to develop and maintain trust, to make commitments and take\r\nresponsibility, to more effectively challenge, negotiate, and learn, and\r\nthereby to improve the quality of the contributions people make to their\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nThis project will adapt knowledge management concepts and techniques, and\r\nthe information technology they employ, to understand and enhance knowledge\r\nmanagement in school organizations. We will work with school\r\nadministrators, but chiefly with teachers. First, we will investigate and\r\ncharacterize knowledge management practices as they exist today, and\r\nidentify needs and opportunities to improve knowledge management. We will\r\nfacilitate teacher-initiated development of organizational knowledge\r\nresources, and identify, and accessibly codify the critical knowledge of\r\nthe school systems.\r\n\r\nWe will assess the impact of this intervention on teachers, on the school\r\nsystem, and on the perception of the school by the community. We will\r\ncompare and contrast this analysis and intervention to knowledge management\r\ninterventions now becoming typical in business organizations.\r\n",
