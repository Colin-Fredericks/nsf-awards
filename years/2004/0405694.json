 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fractional factorial designs (FFDs) are among the most popularly used\r\nexperimental plans in practice. Most existing theory and methods for\r\nFFDs assume that the factors involved in an experiment are symmetrical.\r\nIn many applications, however, this assumption does not hold, because\r\nexperiments can involve multiple groups (or types) of factors (MGFs).\r\nDifferent types of factors have different implications for design and\r\nanalysis, therefore they need to be treated differently.  Three typical\r\nexamples are Taguchi's robust parameter design experiments, Addelman's\r\ncompromise plans and experiments with both qualitative and quantitative\r\nfactors. This project is intended to develop general theory and methods\r\nfor constructing optimal designs with MFGs. Based on the preliminary\r\nresults on robust parameter design, various trade-off strategies will\r\nbe generalized to designs with MFGs and their theoretical properties\r\nwill be studied and characterized. Due to the presence\r\nof different types of factors, the aliasing properties of these designs\r\nare much complicated. The investigator will study the letter patterns\r\nand the coset patterns so as to propose proper criteria for the\r\nconstruction of optimal designs. The structure function approach developed\r\nby the investigator earlier will be further extended and used in this\r\nresearch. The theory and methods for constructing nonregular FFDs with\r\nMGFs will also be investigated and developed. Based on the theory and\r\nmethods developed in this project, optimal designs with economical run\r\nsize will be constructed and tabulated for experimenters in practice.\r\n\r\nStatistical design and analysis of experiments are widely used in\r\nscientific investigation and industrial research and development. The\r\nstudy of experimental design is aimed at constructing optimal experimental\r\nplans that allow experimenters to collect data and discover knowledge in\r\nan economical and efficient way. This project is motivated by the\r\napplication of experimental design methodology for quality improvement\r\nin manufacturing industry, especially the robust parameter design\r\ntechnology. An experiment in robust parameter design usually involves\r\nmultiple groups (or types) of factors, which have different implications\r\nin design and analysis. Most existing design theory and\r\nmethods assume the symmetry between factors, thus are not directly\r\napplicable for robust parameter design. In general, experiments can\r\ninclude multiple groups of factors (MGFs), which should be treated\r\ndifferently in order to generate optimal experimental plans. In this\r\nproject, the investigator intends to develop general theory and methods\r\nfor constructing optimal factorial designs for experiments with MGFs.\r\nThe project consists of three major components. The first component is\r\nto investigate the combinatorial and aliasing properties of fractional\r\nfactorial designs with MGFs; the second component is to propose various\r\noptimality criteria for the construction of optimal designs with MGFs;\r\nthe third component is to theoretically characterize the optimal designs\r\nand tabulate them for experimenters in practice. The project will advance\r\nthe theory and methodology of experimental design as well as enhance\r\nefficient data collection and knowledge discovery in scientific\r\ninvestigation, quality improvement and other applications.\r\n",
