The project theme is Democracy and World Politics, with students working on one of three issue areas:  Foreign Policy in a Democracy, Democratization and Democracy Promotion, and Democracy and Conflict.  These issues are engaging and dynamic, with both academic and popular value.  Each summer, 12 students will work with faculty members to develop research \tquestions and designs within the themes mentioned above.  Students will gather and analyze data and produce scholarly papers reporting their findings.  Activities will include research methods seminars, intensive project development workshops, special presentation by guest scholars, community-forming events, and research under the guidance of project mentors with established records of research and publication.\r\n\r\nThis award contributes to the Foundation's continuing efforts to attract talented students into careers in science through active undergraduate research experiences.\r\n",
