 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award fro the Major Research Instrumentation Program supports the Departments of Chemistry, Engineering Technology, and Physics and Earth Sciences at Central Connecticut State University (CCSU) with the acquisition of a single crystal 3-circle diffractometer. The diffractometer is equipped with a CCD detector and software that is also capable of low temperature, powder, and fiber. The diffractometer will support research at the Departments of Chemistry, Engineering Technology, and Physics and Earth Sciences. It is ideal for small molecule structure determination and materials identification. Equipped with standard accessories for low temperature diffraction and additional software packages for powder/fiber analysis and structural database searching, the instrument will see heavy use on research projects as well as for teaching and outreach activities.\r\n\r\nOver twelve Nobel Prizes have been awarded to scientists who have worked in the field of X-ray crystallography and today it remains the primary experimental method to elucidate the three dimensional structure of molecules- giving accurate determinations of bond lengths, bond angles, and torsion relationships.  This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program will provide funds to Central Connecticut State University (CCSU) for acquisition of a diffractometer. The diffractometer will support research at the Departments of Chemistry, Engineering Technology, and Physics and Earth Sciences. It is ideal for small molecule structure determination and materials identification. Equipped with standard accessories for low temperature diffraction and additional software packages for powder/fiber analysis and structural database searching, the instrument will see heavy use on research projects as well as for teaching and outreach activities.\r\n",
