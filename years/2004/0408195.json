ACC 2004 will be held in Boston, June 30 to July 2, 2004. The conference will focus on theoretical issues, engineering methodologies, and industrial applications in all areas of control research and development.  The primary goal of this project is to expose students to current advances in control theory and applications.  Travel support for student attendees, in the form of ACC 2004 Student Travel Grants, will be advertised nationally.  Women, minorities, and disabled students will be especially encouraged to apply.  Undergraduate and graduate students who attend the conference, present papers, and participate in student-oriented activities are likely to pursue careers in the field of control theory and its applications. \r\n\r\n",
