Hyporheic exchange has particularly been shown to influence nutrient and\r\ncarbon dynamics, and the fate and transport of contaminants in surface waters. These issues have risen to\r\nthe forefront in the Midwestern U.S. because substantial nitrate loads from agriculture and urban centers\r\ncontribute to chronic hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite the clear link that exists between hydrologic\r\nprocesses in headwater streams, denitrification efficiency in removing stream nitrate, and nitrogen loads\r\nreaching the Gulf, our current understanding of these processes in low-gradient, sand-bed streams is\r\nlargely empirical. Most glaring is the lack of, fundamentally-based, predictive models for hyporheic\r\nexchange in sand-bed streams, which has prevented the transfer of experimental observations gained at\r\none site to other sites, or even to the same site under different flow conditions.\r\nOur objective is to collect a definitive data set from a low-gradient, sand-bed stream and test the\r\napplicability of several fundamental, process based models of hyporheic exchange that have proven\r\nsuccessful in laboratory flumes. We seek to both advance our fundamental understanding of hyporheic\r\nexchange processes in real stream, but also to assess the improvements in prediction of solute transport\r\nthat are possible for a variety of flow and geomorphic conditions. The stream selected for intensive study\r\nis Sugar Creek, a headwater stream in the agricultural region along the northern Illinois-Indiana border.\r\nSugar Creek is representative of many low-gradient streams in agricultural headwater areas that are\r\ntributary to the Illinois and Mississippi River systems. We propose to conduct detailed tracer experiments\r\nand related physical measurements that will be notable because they will resolve hyporheic flow paths,\r\nsolute transport, and controlling processes with an unprecedented level of detail. In-stream solute\r\ninjections will be undertaken in several seasons in a 3 to 4 kilometer long reach of Sugar Creek. Stream-tracer\r\ndata will be used to assess bulk transport integrated over 8 to 10 sub-reaches (50  300 m long)\r\nrepresenting variable geomorphic conditions. Several of those sub-reaches will be thoroughly\r\ncharacterized in terms of their streambed topography and morphology, cross-channel flow variability,\r\nsediment characteristics, and subsurface movement of the solute tracer. This unprecedented level of\r\ndetail will be made possible using state of the art measurement technologies. The resulting data sets will\r\nsupport the application of a suite of fundamental, predictive, process-based models of hyporheic exchange\r\nand its effects on downstream solute transport. The models will be evaluated in terms of their ability to\r\npredict not only reach-averaged tracer concentration data, but also point estimates of interfacial hyporheic\r\nflux and porewater tracer concentrations. Based on fundamental theory, we will develop and test\r\napproaches for upscaling rates of hyporheic exchange to predict solute transport in the entire study reach\r\nunder seasonally varying conditions. In sum, we will apply several modeling approaches of differing\r\nsophistication in order to 1) evaluate our current ability to predict hyporheic exchange in sand bed streams\r\nfrom first principles, and 2) develop reasonable approaches for upscaling the computations so that solute\r\ntransport can be predicted with a specified level of uncertainty for longer stream reaches.\r\nBecause this study is focused on fundamental processes that occur widely, this work will have very\r\nbroad scientific impacts and will be used to address multiple pressing societal concerns. Detailed\r\nunderstanding of the relationship between stream/sedimentary conditions and hyporheic exchange will\r\nfacilitate improved understanding of nutrient dynamics, carbon cycling, and releases from contaminated\r\nsediments. Our goals for predictions (in terms of uncertainty and spatial resolution) are compatible with\r\nfuture applications in reach and basin-scale water-quality models. In particular, the choice of Sugar Creek\r\nas the intensive study site will provide critical hydrologic information to support complementary studies\r\non nitrate fluxes and sedimentary denitrification in the headwaters of the Mississippi River basin. The\r\nproject's broader impacts will also be increased by the synergistic activities of the PI's. Both PI's have a\r\nstrong history of involvement in scientific organizations, and the project's themes will be reflected in\r\nactivities such as special sessions at major technical meetings. We will particularly seek to broaden the\r\ngeneral contribution of this work by encouraging interdisciplinary and international communication and\r\ninter-site comparisons. The project will also contribute considerably to human resource development,\r\nboth through direct training of students and via the use of the field site for educational demonstrations.",
