 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposed research will directly address a critical need for nanoscience and technology: broadly useful techniques that have the ability to fabricate complex, well defined three dimensional (3D) nanostructures. Two new methods are proposed here. The first uses single or multilayer transfer of thin solid 'ink' coatings from high resolution rubber stamps onto substrates. The second uses these stamps as conformable phase masks for proximity field nanopatterning of thin layers of transparent photopolymers. Although both techniques use the same pattern transfer elements, they rely on completely different physical principles, and they provide complementary patterning capabilities. The operational simplicity of the techniques, their ability to pattern large areas quickly, and the flexibility in the geometry of structures that can be formed with them suggest general utility for 3D nanomanufacturing.  The scientific thrusts of the program involve: 1) Surface chemistries that can be used to transfer thin solid 'inks' from high resolution rubber stamps to target substrates, and materials for these inks. The aspects that will be investigated, such as surface chemical structure and bonding density required for transfer and physical toughness in ultrathin multilayer assemblies, will enable multilayer and 3D transfer printing. These studies will also provide insights into the molecular-level aspects of adhesion and fracture.  2) Near, proximity and far field optics of high resolution conformable phase masks. Modeling and experimental work will explore the ability to manipulate the 3D flow of light by using masking elements that modulate the optical phase. In addition to their central role in the proximity field nanopatterning approach, these studies will have relevance to conventional photomask design and near field optical imaging and detection.  3) Structure-property relationships in elastomeric polymers that provide high modulus, high physical toughness and high index of refraction. This work will yield materials for robust, reliable stamps and masks for the 3D nanomanufacturing techniques described above. It will also establish general strategies for polymer modification based on (i) bimodal segments, (ii) blends with highly crosslinked network resins domains and (iii) phase separated nanoparticles.\r\n\r\nThe science and methods that emerge from the research will be disseminated widely though conference talks, papers and materials posted on a central website, where they can be accessed and downloaded by any interested parties. Furthermore, the GOALI partner, Dow Corning Corporation, will provide expertise in new materials and processing methods, thus ensuring broad technology transfer of successful efforts and excellent educational and outreach opportunities for the students.  A hands-on summer laboratory course on nanofabrication will be developed to introduce this important area to students from a wide range of disciplines. It will also expose these fields to underrepresented undergraduate students from Clark Atlanta University, an historically black institution, who will actively participate in this summer course and the research.\r\n",
