 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is constructing a modern infrastructure to support cross-disciplinary research and to serve as a catalyst for student training in the fields of applied information processing, neuroscience, and assistive technology research.  By merging these fields, a foundation is set for (1) developing new methodologies destined to respond effectively to the issue of universal accessibility, and (2) establishing research strategies to meet impending needs in neuroscience as functional mappings and causality of key brain disorders are developed.  The infrastructure includes a high performance computational cluster with an active display mural, a magnetic link for integrating electroencephalography to magnetic resonance imagery, an optical topography system for near-infrared spectroscopy, and an eye-gaze tracking system.  The infrastructure extends the research capabilities of Florida International University (FIU) and enables long-range improvements in neuroscience and assistive technology.  The infrastructure is envisioned to provide researchers with an environment that is conducive to cross training among disciplines, supported by experimental evaluations and feasibility studies, from which prototype designs are moved to the realm of practicality.  New opportunities are made possible for consolidating a joint FIU-Miami children's Hospital neuroscience program worthy of national distinction.  In assistive technology research, a primary objective is to design the next generation of human computer interfaces that are multimodal and adaptive as real-time assistive systems that extend the functional capabilities of persons with motor and visually disabilities.  On the educational front, new curriculum is planned, with engineers, computer scientists, neuroscientists, and radiologists working together for an integrated approach to the teaching and training of students.  Furthermore, this project strengthens FIU's outreach programs for recruiting outstanding Ph.D. students.  This is coupled with sustained commitments to recruiting and retaining underrepresented minorities in CISE-related disciplines.",
