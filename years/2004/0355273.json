The principal investigator introduced a notion of tracial topological rank for C*-algebras. It has been established that this new rank is quite useful in classification of nuclear simple C*-algebras.  The investigator proposes to classify unital simple nuclear C*-algebras with tracial topological rank no more than one by their K-theoretical data. These C*-algebras include most known nuclear simple C*-algebras.  The investigator also proposes to determine tracial topological ranks for many naturally occurred simple C*-algebras.\r\n\r\nThe simplest examples of noncommutative C*-algebras are collections of matrices. In general, C*-algebras could be thought as collections of infinite matrices.  In quantum mechanics physical quantities are represented by operators on a Hilbert space i.e. by infinite matrices. C*-algebras appeared as an outgrowth of quantum physics.  But C*-algebras also provide the natural framework for generalizing geometry, topology and measure theory in a fundamental noncommutative way of wide applicability.  Simple C*-algebras can be viewed as the key to understanding quantum variables. They are the fundamental building blocks of more general C*-algebras as well as the typical noncommutative C*-algebras.  This research project is to study how to describe these C*-algebras via a few data which is topological in nature.  Immediate applications can be established in the study of dynamical systems.\r\n",
