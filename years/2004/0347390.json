 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless sensor networks operate under a set of unique constraints and requirements, bringing in new challenges that go far beyond existing theories and algorithms.  This project studies some fundamental performance limits and trade-offs that are inherent to wireless sensor networks, with the aim of laying a theoretical underpinning for future protocol design and algorithm implementation.  Specifically, there are three thrust areas under the overarching theme of energy constraints and network lifetime on which we are concentrating our efforts: (1) maximizing network lifetime through optimal power-controlled flow routing; (2) understanding performance limits and the trade-offs between relay node placement and energy provisioning; and (3) uncovering the inherent properties associated with the energy-constrained rate allocation problem.  Our approach is multi-disciplinary: it spans the fields of wireless communications, networking algorithms, and optimizations. The outcome of this research will fill important gaps in the current understanding of wireless sensor networks, enabling this growing field to fully realize its potential.  The research in the first area will help us to develop basic research methodologies for the study of lifetime-centric flow routing in sensor networks. The research in the second area will enhance understanding of performance limits and trade-offs with significant implications for both theory and practice. The research in the third area will reveal inherent properties in energy-constrained sensor networks and formalize some basic theories for rate allocation and capacity. This project will enrich our knowledge of wireless sensor networks as well as provide a basis for novel graduate and undergraduate educational and mentoring activities.",
