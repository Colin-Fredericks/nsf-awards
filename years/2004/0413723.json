 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is co-funded by the Division of Design, Manufacturing and Industrial Innovation and the Office of International Science and Engineering.  This award supports a workshop focused on the development of strong collaborative research and education programs between leading USA and South African research institutions in the area of the research, development and education of advanced emerging manufacturing concepts and technologies.  A strong delegation of US researchers and leaders in the manufacturing community, currently engaged in emerging manufacturing research, will attend and participate in the collaborative research workshop.  The proposed timeframe for the workshop is October 4-8, 2004, and will be held in South Africa at targeted venues identified by the workshop planning committee comprised of South African (host) counter-PI's and the Co-PIs of this proposal.  The proposed timing of the workshop has been carefully positioned for leveraging the maximum opportunity for constructive academic exchange, networking and the development of strong research partnership between prominent SA researchers and the members of the US delegation.  \r\n\r\nThe core workshop objective will be the development of specific agenda for collaborative research and education programs in emerging manufacturing areas, identified as a result of the workshop, that will take full advantage of the many, diverse opportunities provided through international collaboration.   Immediate outcomes from the workshop will include a workshop report providing recommendations and opportunities for collaborative research with SA research organizations that will be presented to the NSF and disseminated through the manufacturing research community via regular channels provided by professional organizations, including the Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME), and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). \r\n\r\n",
