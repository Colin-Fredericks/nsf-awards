This REU site will utilize the University of Central Florida's expertise in simulation and training with applications for national security and defense.  Research areas will include trajectory planning and collision avoidance, advanced kinematic and dynamic controls of mobile robots and unmanned aerial vehicles, intelligent and cooperative controls, and performance-enabling analysis and simulations.  \r\n\r\nThe REU site involves 12 undergraduate students annually for 10 weeks in the summer.  The site has collaborating governmental and academic institutions, an ethics component, and a detailed management plan.  It will disseminate the research findings of the students through journal publications and the web, and at professional conferences.  \r\n\r\nThis project will be supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
