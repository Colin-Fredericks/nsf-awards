These include new applications of process control throughout the many\r\nindustries that involve chemical processes and products, including biochemical and\r\nmaterials processing; the development of new sensors; the development of new\r\ntechniques that integrate process design and scheduling with control; new methods for\r\nperformance monitoring; and new methods for modeling and identification.  Like past conferences, DYCOPS-7 is expected to catalyze the expansion of process\r\ndynamics and control applications in the manufacture of specialty chemicals using batch\r\nprocesses, in biochemical and biomedical applications, and in improved design strategies\r\nto achieve more controllable processes, among many other areas.\r\n\r\nBroad Impact\r\n\r\nThe DYCOPS-7 symposium should have a broad impact due to three key factors. First,\r\nover 160 outstanding researchers in process dynamics and control will be participating\r\nfrom a broad array of countries worldwide. The advances reported by the plenary\r\nspeakers and individual researchers are intended to significantly advance the operability\r\nand safety of chemical plants, increasing their productivity and profitability while\r\nprotecting against the increased threat of terrorism. Second, the symposium will enable\r\nresearchers in the United States to benefit from the experiences of colleagues worldwide,\r\nmany of whom are involved in operating world-class chemical plants in developing\r\ncountries. Third, the symposium will bring together outstanding young graduate student\r\nresearchers from the United States, many of whom will present the results of their\r\nresearch for the first time at a technical conference. These young researchers should\r\nreturn to their doctoral research studies with increased motivation and new ideas based\r\nupon interactions with their new colleagues.\r\n",
