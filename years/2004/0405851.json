 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims at a detailed investigation of structural and electronic properties of Group III-nitride semiconductor heterostructures employing scanning probe measurement techniques to characterize electronic properties of nitride semiconductor epitaxial layers with spatial resolution at the submicron to nanometer scale. Included in this effort will be the development and implementation of unique new experimental capabilities for characterization of electronic structure of defects with both nanoscale spatial resolution and resolution in energy enabled by spectrally resolved optical excitation. Efforts in state-of-the-art nanoscale materials characterization will be complemented by a variety of \"macroscopic\" electrical and optical measurements to enable correlations to be established among nanoscale material properties, electrical and optical behavior at macroscopic length scales, and device performance. This approach is expected to establish a sound basis for development of clear, effective, and well-informed strategies for improvement in material quality and optimization of device performance. Particular emphasis will be placed on investigation of issues relevant to the performance of nitride semiconductor-based optoelectronic devices, to be facilitated by a collaboration with researchers at EMCORE Corporation. Research outcomes expected are relevant to applications that include high-density data storage, displays, solid-state lighting, and communications infrastructure.\r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high potential technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to new understanding and capabilities in electronic and photonic devices. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. In addition to education of graduate students and researchers in areas of scientific and technological importance, undergraduate students will be afforded opportunities to become involved in state-of-the-art research in electronic materials and nanoscale science and technology.\r\n***\r\n",
