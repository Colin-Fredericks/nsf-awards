 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Minority Postdoctoral Research Fellowship for FY 2003. The goal of the fellowship is to increase the participation of minority scientists at the postdoctoral level and to prepare them for positions of scientific leadership in academia and industry.  To attain this goal, the fellowship provides opportunities for postdoctoral training and research of the highest quality to recent doctoral recipients.   It is expected that Fellows supported through these fellowships will play important roles in training of the future workforce.\r\n\r\nThe research and training plan is entitled \"Analyzing the role of hTPR in retention of pre-mRNA in mammalian cells.\"  Eukaryotic cells retain intron-containing mRNAs in the nucleus until splicing is complete.  A protein Mlp1p mediates the retention in yeast. This research investigates the role of its homologue hTPR in mammalian cells. Its role in the topology of splicing, splicing control steps and spatial positioning is being assessed by monitoring the formation of pre-mRNA in vivo as a function of RNAi dependent hTPR knockdown.\r\n",
