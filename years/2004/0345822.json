SUNGIRL currently consists of: 1) a Micromass 5400 noble gas mass spectrometer and automated extraction line, and 2) a quadrupole mass spectrometer and automated extraction line for He analysis in conjunction with (U-Th)/He dating of accessory phases. Each extraction line utilizes its own double-vacuum resistance furnace for out-gassing rocks and minerals.  A shared CO2 laser system can also be used for out-gassing mineral grains (including flux monitors) in conjunction with (U-Th)/He and 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology. The focus of the thermochronology research group at Syracuse University is on determining the pressure-temperature-time-deformation (P-T-t-D) evolution of crustal terranes and quantifying rates of geologic processes.  The excimer laser system will enhance graduate and undergraduate student education and training through the use of cutting-edge technology for in situ analysis.  Data obtained using the proposed laser system will: 1) be highlighted in two graduate and upper-level undergraduate courses (Thermochronology and Microstructural Analysis) taught by the PIs, 2) be presented at national and international meetings, and 3) be published in the Earth Science literature.  SUNGIRL employs undergraduate students through NSF REU grants and is a showcase laboratory at Syracuse University for technology in the Earth Sciences, and for women in science and technology.  The laser system will be used by Syracuse University faculty, researchers, post-doctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students, and visiting researchers. Syracuse University will contribute 30% towards the cost of the laser system.\r\n\r\n",
