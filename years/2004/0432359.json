They will work with Dr. Adreina Adelstein, Universidad Nacional de General Sarmiento, Dr. Guiomar E. Ciapuscio, Universidad de Buenos Aires, and Dr. Marcela A. Depiante, Universidad Nacional del Comahue, in Argentina, on the initiation and organization of joint research on theoretical linguistics, concentrating on the nature of the features found in human language.  Both the PI and the Argentines are conducting research on the nature of the features relevant to computations in syntax, morphology, and semantics.  During the visit, the PI will work with his counterparts to develop (1) a shared set of theoretical background assumptions in the context of which further research can be pursued jointly, and (2) a precise set of initial research questions to be examined, along with (3) a proposed division of labor for initial investigation of these questions.  In addition, the PI will investigate the possibility that language acquisition studies of children acquiring a first language can be incorporated into the research program along with the theoretical methodologies to be employed.  The final project will further our knowledge of the nature of the features found in the grammar of human language, and the architecture of the grammar of human language.\r\n\r\n",
