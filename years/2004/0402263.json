 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is creating a new course, curriculum, and program materials for the education of technicians in highly automated manufacturing environments. Working from a set of nationally validated skills standards developed during a comprehensive study by the Maricopa Advanced Technology Education Center (MATEC), Mohawk Valley Community College (MVCC) is partnering with twelve community colleges, industry leaders, and MATEC in this effort. Faculty development includes activities to identify and gain knowledge in key technologies and partnerships with experts in the field to develop methods of delivery and assessment for the subject materials. Wider dissemination to regional industries and secondary education teachers and students is through regional workshops.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project involves addressing a key need to meet educational requirements for operators and technicians in the evolving worldwide manufacturing market. Highly automated manufacturing operations are emerging in semiconductor, pharmaceutical, automotive, food processing and other industries. Education of personnel to maintain, install, upgrade, and troubleshoot these systems is therefore of significant national importance. The project addresses these needs by developing program enhancements that will be applied to existing Electrical, Mechanical, Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology and other degree programs at MVCC. Hands-on laboratory experiences using a highly automated system trainer provide real-time experiences by simulating current production methods. MVCC is partnering with MATEC to call upon their extensive experience in educational materials development to guide faculty in the creation learning activities using innovative concepts and delivery systems\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project are attained through wider dissemination of the materials and concepts developed, and the collegial relationships with other institutions and industries that the project provides. MVCC, as a partner with MATEC and 12 other colleges, is sharing the results of these efforts with a significantly larger group of individuals than would be addressed through a local effort alone. Through cooperation with industries supporting this program, including INTEL, IBM, SMC-IT, and regional industries, closer alliances between industry and education are being developed.\r\n\r\nMVCC is an active supporter of several initiatives to encourage secondary school students to pursue careers in the technologies. The project is enhancing this effort through sponsorship of professional development workshops for secondary education teachers and demonstrations for students interested in entering this highly challenging field.\r\n\r\n",
