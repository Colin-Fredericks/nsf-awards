 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)\r\n\r\nApproximately 120 chemists from academia and business, chemistry education researchers, cognitive psychologists, and other researchers in education will be attending the 9th Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Chemistry Education Research and Practice (CERP). The goal of the GRC/CERP is to bring together researchers who carry out research both within and related to chemistry education, in order to benefit the learning and teaching of all students in chemistry courses in colleges and universities. The specific objectives of this conference are to (a) exchange the latest research findings and classroom results, (b) critique innovations in the methodological design of chemistry education research (CER) studies, and (c) debate a research agenda for CER that identifies the most critical of problems to be investigated in the next decade. NSF support ensures the continued attendance of scholars who might not otherwise be present at the conference. These include community college faculty, faculty from institutions that serve predominantly underrepresented or disadvantaged students, and young, first-time attendees such as post-doctoral researchers and graduate students in the field of CER (Chemical Education Research). The conference's success in achieving its goals depends upon active participation of these scholars.\r\n\r\n",
