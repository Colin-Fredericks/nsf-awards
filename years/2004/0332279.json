 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is an NSF sponsored CBMS conference on the subject of graph C*-algebras, featuring Professor Iain Raeburn as the principal lecturer, to be hosted by the University of Iowa during the week, May 31 to\r\nJune 4, 2004. Graph C*-algebras have played a very important role in operator algebra during the last 20 years. During the past 10 years, the subject has blossomed substantially. Graph algebras and the technology\r\nsurrounding them appear in almost every aspect of operator algebra. The theory of graph C*-algebras has achieved a certain level of maturity and organization that makes this a propitious moment to collect in one place a presentation of it and to give a general survey of their wide impact. Further, the basic theory of graph C*-algebras is now very much accessible to graduate students and other novice researchers in the field. The  CBMS conference is intended to attract a large array of young mathematicians.\r\n\r\n",
