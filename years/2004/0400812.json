 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI and his coauthors will  work on extremal problems for set\r\nsystems or hypergraphs using combinatorial, algebraic,\r\nprobabilistic, and topological methods. The basic problem of\r\nextremal hypergraph theory is the so called Turan problem:\r\ndetermine the maximum number of subsets a finite set can have\r\nwithout containing some fixed forbidden configuration. This\r\nquestion, in its full generality, is very difficult, and certain\r\nspecial cases are famous problems that have been open for over 50\r\nyears. Nevertheless, substantial work on closely related issues\r\nhas occurred recently, and the limits of this recent progress will\r\nbe explored. Although several different aspects are considered\r\n(Ramsey-Turan problems, jumps in hypergraphs, degenerate problems\r\nfor simplices), the common theme is to obtain a hypergraph\r\nanalogue of the Erdos-Simonovits-Stone theorem, the cornerstone of\r\nextremal graph theory.\r\n\r\nThe general topic of finite set systems has connections to diverse\r\nareas of mathematics (combinatorial geometry, design theory,\r\npartially ordered sets, additive number theory), and also to\r\nacademic disciplines with concrete applications in everyday life\r\n(coding theory, information theory, optimization and scheduling\r\nproblems, computer science). Modern communication would be\r\nimpossible without the existence of codes, or objects designed to\r\nrelay information faithfully even in the face of distortion.\r\nExtremal problems for set systems play a role in constructing\r\ncodes for various situations.\r\n\r\n",
