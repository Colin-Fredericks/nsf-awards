 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project increases the number of STEM graduates by utilizing and expanding the institution's proven recruiting and retention strategies. Over the course of the project 4000+ high school students will be exposed to STEM careers through high school design competitions, on and off-site visits, faculty mentoring, Technology Days, Engineering Days, summer engineering camps, and through one-on-one follow-up. Once recruited, engineering students enter a program that provides them with an environment conducive to success. Each student has a personal \"academic coach\" who meets with him or her weekly, maintains a weekly dialogue, and actively tracks progress. Students are exposed to design early and often. Student activities include weekly social events with their cohort and visits at up to 7 regional universities per year. The project will produce approximately 500 new baccalaureate STEM graduates over the course of the grant period.\r\n\r\n",
