 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hurricanes are natural events that can impose a major perturbation to estuarine\r\necosystems. Some effects of previous hurricanes on Chesapeake Bay (e.g., Agnes in\r\n1972) had lasting impacts on submerged aquatic vegetation (drastic decrease) and on\r\nfisheries (e.g. soft clam and oyster decline after Agnes). This SGER (Small Grant for Exploratory Reserch) project will examine\r\nthe effects of Hurricane Isabel on the hydrographic and food-web structure of\r\nChesapeake Bay. \r\nHurricane Isabel, which struck Chesapeake Bay on September 18,\r\n2003, provides a unique opportunity to document and evaluate effects of a significant\r\n.disturbance event.. Winds in excess of 70 mph vigorously mixed Bay waters. A storm\r\nsurge, 6.12 ft at the Bay mouth took 18 hours to move up the Bay to Baltimore where\r\nmaximum water level was 7.36 ft above mean high water. This significant intrusion of\r\nshelf water redistributed salt, plankton and fish within Chesapeake Bay. The 2003 Water\r\nYear (WY), which includes rainfall associated with Isabel (Oct . Sept) represented the\r\nhighest WY freshwater input to Chesapeake Bay since 1937. The passage of Isabel\r\nduring the unusually wet 2003 provides a unique opportunity to evaluate effects of a\r\nmajor perturbation on already enhanced freshwater input to the Bay ecosystem.\r\n\tThe project will involved a 7-day cruise in early November, 2003 in which the same\r\nsampling procedures are followed that were designated during the six TIES years (1995-\r\n2000) and two BITMAX years (2001-2002) thus providing an essential contrast to\r\nconditions that observed in the wake of Hurricane Isabel.  Investigators will intensively measure the hydrographic and ecosystem structure of the main stem of\r\nChesapeake Bay. On leg 1 (3 days) they will conduct continuous mapping using a towed\r\nundulating recorder and surface mapping system which measures temperature, salt,\r\noxygen, chlorophyll and zooplankton (Optical Plankton Counter) along a 350-km axial\r\ntransect down the main stem of Chesapeake Bay and with up to 24 cross-Bay transects\r\nspaced 10 km apart. The vertical and horizontal resolution of these measurements will be\r\napproximately 1 m and 200 m, respectively. Maps of physical and biological properties\r\nwill provide an essential background for the hydrographic, plankton and fish surveys that\r\nwill follow. On the second leg (4 days) they will conduct hydrographic stations (CTDs)\r\nand measurements of nutrients, phytoplankton biomass and production, zooplankton\r\npump and acoustic measurements, and fish abundance/distributions (Tucker trawl and\r\nmidwater trawl) on 26 Bay-transects. CBOS moorings, including the damaged stations,\r\nwill be maintained through the interval.\r\n\r\n",
