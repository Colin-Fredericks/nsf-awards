 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Semiparametric and nonparametric models for correlated data\r\n\r\nAbstract:\r\n\r\nThis research project is aimed at developing statistical theory and\r\npractical methodology for complex high dimensional correlated data\r\nwhere the full parametric likelihood function of the model is difficult\r\nto specify or intractable, and partial data information is not accurate\r\nor is missing. The PI and her collaborators  will develop\r\nefficient and robust estimation procedures by incorporating\r\ncorrelation structures  into the models where high dimensional\r\nnuisance parameters are present, and develop inference functions\r\nfor hypothesis testing with low computational intensity.\r\nPart of research goals for the 5-year plan are:\r\nto provide an explicit maximum number of contaminated\r\nclusters allowed to maintain the consistency of the estimator using\r\nquadratic inference functions; to develop unbiased and efficient\r\nestimating functions if missing responses are missing at random,\r\nand inference functions for testing the model assumption;\r\nto develop an efficient esimator using a nonparametric regression\r\nspline with relatively low demand on computation, and introduce a\r\ngoodness-of-fit test with a chi-squared property for testing whether\r\ncoefficients in nonparametric regression  are time-varying or time\r\ninvariant; and, to develop semi-nonparametric models for cell cycle\r\nmicroarray data to incorporate both temporal correlation within genes\r\nand correlation between biologically related genes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis research will have significant impact and many applications in\r\nbiomedical research, econometrics, environmental studies, oceanography,\r\nsocial science and public health where correlated data arise\r\noften. The outlined research projects help to tackle fundamental\r\nquestions in statistical science and will stimulate interest  from a\r\nlarge group of scientists. It also makes connections between\r\ntheory and methods developed in econometrics, statistics and\r\nbiostatistics. The proposed research will benefit biomedical research\r\nto help combat life threatening diseases such as AIDS and cancer,\r\nand will make contributions to identifying cell cycle regulated genes\r\nmore accurately. It will integrate current states of knowledge of\r\nproposed research areas substantially into  educational activities\r\nthrough development of\r\nnew courses on  nonparametric methods and microarray data analysis.\r\nIt will advance undergraduate and graduate students' learning and\r\ntraining in semiparametric and nonparametric methods. Furthermore,\r\nit will broaden opportunities and enable the\r\nparticipation of all citizens from various disciplines, including\r\nunderrepresented minorities and international partnerships.\r\n",
