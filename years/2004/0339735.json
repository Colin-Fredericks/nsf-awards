The U.S. team has expertise in the dioxythiophene and dioxypyrrole polymer systems.  This is complemented by French specialization in tetrazine, triazine, and cyclophane systems. The goals are to study the optoelectronic and redox properties of these polymer systems.  Four properties, which may have special impact, are targeted: n-Type doping, multi-color electrochromism, combined  electrochromic/photochromic materials, and controlled luminescence.  Instrumentation for photochromic and fluorescence experiments is available in the French laboratory.   \r\n \r\nThe project will advance our understanding in polymer design and has potential to lead to new electrochromic/photochromic materials with applications in optics and electronics.  U.S. students will be trained in international research and have the opportunity to establish early on in their careers international research connections.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS).  NSF provides funds for visits to France by the investigators and graduate students.  The CNRS will support visits to the United States by the French team.\r\n",
