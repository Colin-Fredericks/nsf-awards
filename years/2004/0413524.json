 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dendrimers are unique and relatively new macromolecular systems whose exponentially branched interiors and dense exterior functional groups offer a number of advantageous properties.  The interior or exterior  regions  of  dendrimers  can  be  functionalized with  specific  binding  groups,  ranging  from  crown ethers to hydrogen bonded complexes, to selectively adsorb a desired guest system,  and the high density of  functional  groups  in  the  dendrimer  molecule  allows  for  highly  efficient  targeted  binding  of  biological substrates.  Dendritic materials systems have also been shown to act as nanoreactors for the formation of  metals  and  metal  oxides,  and  as  agents  in  solubilization  and  separations  applications.    Dendritic \r\narchitectures  can  be  tailored  for  specific  interactions,  or  for  electrical,  optical  or  biological  functionality.   For  these  reasons,  dendrimers  represent  a  unique  macromolecular  system  with  novel  and  interesting  properties.   In recent years, a number of important synthetic developments have led to the creation of novel linear-dendritic  hybrid  block  copolymers  with  a  wide  variety  of  chemical  and  structural  properties.  Linear-dendritic  hybrid  copolymers  offer  a  clear  opportunity  to  take  advantage  of  the  properties  of dendrimers and the phase segregated morphological self-assembly of traditional block copolymers, which have been shown to self-assemble in solution to form concentrated lyotropic phases such as lamellae and columnar phases, and micellar phases consisting of spherical and cylindrical micellar systems.   Although the  amphiphilic  behavior  of  linear  block  copolymers  has  been  studied  extensively,  resulting  in  an understanding of the lyotropic phases presented by these systems, there has not been an extensive study of amphiphilic linear-dendritic hybrid block copolymers, and their assembly behavior in solution.   \r\n   \r\nIt is  the  objective  and  intellectual  merit  of  this  work  to  undertake  the  first  systematic  and inclusive  examination  of  linear-dendritic  block  copolymer  self-assembly  in  the  solution  state,  from concentrated  to  dilute  polymer  solution,  and  the  investigation  of  the  stabilized  nanostructured materials resulting from this assembly.   The architecture and topology of the highly branched dendritic block  is  expected  to  lead  to  changes  in  the  preferred  curvature  at  the  block  copolymer  interface,  and variations and shifts in the solution phase behavior of these systems, as has been observed in studies of the bulk morphology of these systems in funded by the previoius related grant creativity extension.   Linear-dendritic block copolymers represent a new form of macromolecular amphiphile which may exhibit novel phase  behavior;  this  work  will  contribute  significantly  to  a  fundamental  understanding  of  these macroamphiphiles,  and  the  effects  of generation,  linear  block  length  and  solvent-polymer  interactions  on the  assembly  in  solution.  It  is  anticipated  that  the  phase  behavior  of  these  systems will  introduce  a  new paradigm to the area of macromolecular amphiphiles . rather than the traditional hydrodynamic radius of a coil-coil block copolymer, it is possible to examine the arrangement of a block consisting of the coil and a much more geometrically constrained polymer block.  \r\n   \r\nThe  broader  impacts  of  this  study  include  the  creation  of  novel  self-assembled  dendritic \r\nnanostructures  ranging  from  continuous  phase  nanoporous  media  to  highly  functional  dendritic nanoparticles  and  other  nanoscale  objects.    The potential use of such linear-dendritic  hybrid  block copolymers as templates  for the  formation of nanostructured materials and nanoscale objects is yet to be explored,  and  is  expected  to  impact  the  design  of  nanostructured materials  systems.  Utilizing  the principles  of  amphiphilic  block  copolymer  assembly, micellar  systems containing dendritic  exteriors  and linear chain interiors will be created and stabilized with crosslinking, resulting in nanoparticles for which  the exterior functionality is 10 to 100 times greater than that of the original dendron.  The presence of the dendritic block will be advantageous for a number of applications, including the creation of nanostructured porous  materials  formed  from  the  lyotropic  phase  in which,  for  example,  the  dendrimer  end  groups  are exposed  within  the  interiors  of  nanopores  that  provide  a  highly  reactive  surface  region  for  catalytic  or interactive pores.  A number of new and novel materials structures can result from the careful design and synthesis  of  functional  linear-dendritic  systems  which  may  undergo  crosslinking,  encourage  or  support metal oxide synthesis, or serve as a template for a second organic material.    Finally, the research described here  is  an  integral  part  of  the  investigator's  research  and  teaching  plan,  and  includes  the  education  and training of undergraduate and graduate students in the laboratory environment, the integration of concepts of  self-assembly  in  the  teaching  of  polymer  science  in  under-graduate  and  graduate  courses.  The mentorship of students takes place on every level, including academic and career issues, work and family concerns, and includes a number of women and minority students.  Outreach of the PI includes teaching of students aged 9-12 in a Math and Science Saturday Program in Cambridge. \r\n\r\n",
