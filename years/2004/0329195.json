 "awd_abstract_narration": "This GOALI project includes atomic level studies of thin film structures needed for future generations of nano-electronics technology. The initial focus will be on hafnium oxide on silicon, later extending to more technologically interesting systems such as hafnium silicates on nitride barriers. This project will involve graduate students working in an academic and industrial (Air Liquide (AL)) setting to establish the relationships among growth conditions, hafnium-containing precursor purity, method of transient delivery of reactive fluids, atomic scale structural properties of the high dielectric constant structure/Si(100) interfaces, and high-temperature post-processing/structure/\r\nfunction relationships. The gas phase composition during the growth process is to be monitored with unique real-time vapor phase detection. The properties, structure, and functionality of the films will be investigated with complementary techniques such as atomic scale resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy/electron energy loss spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy with monolayer sensitivity, X-ray diffraction, and electrical characterization.  The solid-state diffusion-reaction problems emerging from the oxidation and silicidation among adjacent elements during high temperature post-deposition processes will be studied with detailed physicochemical models.\r\n\r\nThe project is anticipated to have a broad impact on micro- and nano-electronics technology and on the development of human resources. The involved students, both graduate and undergraduate, will engage in different atomic scale approaches to the growth and characterization of surface and interface nanostructures. Graduate students will regularly present their work to AL researchers, who will also provide experience in communication and project-oriented style of research management in an industrial setting. The University of Illinois at Chicago has a strong record of providing excellent educational experiences to a diverse body of students, including many women and under-represented minorities.  An NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates Site is also in place at the Chicago campus focused on \"Novel Materials and Processing.\r\n",
