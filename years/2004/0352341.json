 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed support of a project aimed at developing and disseminating novel software to be used in the processing and analysis of optical biosensor data.  The software will be used with commercial biosensing instruments that employ surface plasmon resonance (SPR), typically to study protein binding reactions.  Previous work of the PI has led to development of software tools that significantly improve SPR data quality and reduce analysis time.  The software has been made available through a website, and several advanced user workshops have been held.  The work supported by this award will lead to further improvement of the software.  In addition to its utility in experiments, the software will serve as a training tool to teach new users the details of SPR data analysis, and will aid users in improving the design and execution of SPR-based biosensor experiments.  An improved website and additional workshops will be used to disseminate information about the new software.",
