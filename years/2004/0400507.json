 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI plans to pursue research in three different areas. First the PI \r\nplans to extend the work of Brenti, Remmel, Beck, Langley, Wagner and \r\nothers who have used certain homomorphisms from the ring of symmetric \r\nfunctions to a polynomial ring F[x], for an appropriately chosen field F, \r\nto find new generating functions for permutations statistics. Recently \r\ndiscovered methods by the PI and his students have produced many new \r\napplications of these methods which allow one to find generating functions \r\nfor 321-avoiding permutations, alternating permutations, and permutation \r\nenumeration statistics for various subgroups of the wreath product of a \r\nfinite group with the symmetric group. The PI plans to systemize and extend \r\nsuch methods. Second, the PI plans to study the combinatorics of various \r\nsubmodules of the ring of diagonal harmonics which is intimately connected \r\nwith the theory of Macdonald polynomials. The work of Garsia, Haiman, \r\nHaglund, Loehr and the PI have lead to combinatorial interpretations of the \r\nHilbert series and the generating function for the occurrences of the \r\nalternating representation in the character of such submodules under the \r\ndiagonal action in terms of counting various classes of labeled Dyck paths \r\naccording to certain statistics. More recently, Haiman, Haglund, Loehr, \r\nRemmel and Ulyanov have given a conjectured combinatorial interpretation of \r\nthe coefficient of a monomial symmetric function in the Frobenius series of \r\nthe ring of diagonal harmonics. The goal of the PI's research in this area \r\nis to prove some of these conjectures and to give a full combinatorial \r\ninterpretation of the Frobenius series of the ring of diagonal harmonics. \r\nFinally the PI also plans to work on (p,q)-analogues of rook theory and \r\nvarious extension of rook theory and the theory of enumeration of spanning \r\nforests of various directed graphs studied by Egecioglu, Williamson and the PI.\r\n\r\nThis project is concerned with various problems which arise in the study of \r\nalgebraic combinatorics. In particular, the goal of this project is to \r\nincrease our understanding of how various classical combinatorial \r\nstructures such as permutations, lattice paths, spanning trees and \r\nplacements of non-attaching rooks on generalized chess boards play a \r\nfundamental role in helping us understand certain algebraic structures. \r\nConversely, in algebraic combinatorics, one wants to understand how various \r\nalgebraic structures can give new insights into the theory of these \r\nclassical combinatorial structures. The three main areas of research \r\nproposed in this project, namely the theory of permutation enumeration, the \r\ntheory of the ring of diagaonal harmonics and rook theory are all active \r\nareas of research were there is a beautiful interplay between algebraic and \r\ncombinatorial methods.\r\n",
