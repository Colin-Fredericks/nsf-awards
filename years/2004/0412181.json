 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catherine M. Oertel, Cornell University, is a Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellow for the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 academic years. Oertel will integrate her talents and experiences in music, materials chemistry and education in a project on the chemistry of historical pipe organs. Centuries-old pipe organs provide unique opportunities to study long-term corrosion, specifically how tin alloy composition, microstructure and environmental factors contribute to corrosion. In complementary efforts, Oertel will develop learning activites for students that use music and musical instruments to teach concepts of physics, chemistry and materials science. She will also participate in an international and interdisciplinary partnership between the Goteborg Organ Art Center and Chalmers University of Technology in Sweden and Cornell University that will result in a new, historically informed pipe organ at Cornell. This Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\nThe Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service.  Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need.  Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation.  The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.\r\n",
