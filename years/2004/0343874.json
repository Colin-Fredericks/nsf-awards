 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biofilms are assemblages of microorganisms and their associated extracellular matrix.  In natural settings bacteria are associated with other cells in biofilms that coat biological and abiological surfaces.  Some biofilms cause economic and health problems in industrial and medical settings.  Cells in biofilms assemble striking three-dimensional structures through the use of cell signaling processes.  An often-ignored aspect of biofilms is the use of shared space, the extracellular matrix, to channel metabolites and signals from cell to cell that synchronize the behavior of the population.  Myxococcus xanthus mutants that are unable to secrete the matrix are impaired in biofilm formation, motility, chemotaxis, and fruiting body development.  This grant is one of the very first attempts to examine the genetics and biochemistry of the matrix of any bacterium, and it does so by focussing on a newly discovered cell communication pathway that coordinates M. xanthus cell motility in response to the lipid signal phosphatidylethanolamine (PE).  The research will examine the essential structural features of the PE signal through mass spectrometry and synthetic chemistry.  The extracellular matrix proteome will be purified and identified by mass spectrometry using the newly completed M. xanthus genome sequence.  Gene disruption will be used to identify essential matrix proteins and elucidate the mechanism by which the extracellular matrix initiates signal perception and transduces this information to the Dif chemosensory system.  Finally the methylated chemotaxis receptor DifA will be subjected to site-directed and random mutagenesis to identify regions involved in PE chemotaxis.",
