Ogle\r\n\r\nThis award provides partial support for participant costs of a\r\nconference on the \"Geometry and Topology of Manifolds\" at Ohio\r\nState University.  The main themes of the meeting are invariants\r\nof manifolds arising in square-integrable cohomology, K-theory,\r\nand geometric group theory.  Invited speakers and other\r\nparticipants include a number of female mathematicians, recent\r\nPhDs, and graduate students.\r\n\r\nA manifold is a geometric space in which every point has\r\nneighborhoods that can be identified with Euclidean space of some\r\ndimension.  For example, every point on the surface of a\r\n2-dimensional sphere lies in an open hemisphere that can be\r\nflattened onto the Euclidean plane by a map projection.  An\r\nexample of a higher dimensional manifold would be the space of\r\nphysical coordinates for three particles moving in the plane\r\nwithout collisions: each particle's dynamical data consists of\r\ntwo position and two velocity coordinates, thus each of the three\r\nparticles requires four numbers to record its dynamics and to\r\nreport all three moving particles simultaneously calls for twelve\r\ncoordinates.  \"Invariants\" of manifolds are computable objects\r\n(not necessarily numbers) that help us tell one space from\r\nanother, and some of the known invariants can be constructed by\r\nmethods of calculus (such as square-integrable cohomology),\r\nalgebraic tools (K-theory), and by looking at very long-range\r\nbehavior of the manifold or of algebraic objects associated to it\r\n(geometric group theory).\r\n\r\n",
