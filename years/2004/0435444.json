The new architecture provides a unified substrate for enabling and supporting new Internet services, while leveraging existing IP networks for data delivery. In the SOI architecture three key abstractions are advanced: 1) the notion of service cloud which is an abstract representation of a collection of service entities that an application or information service provider deploys over the Internet to fur-nish its services; 2) a new two-level, location-independent addressing scheme consisting of a globally defined, fixed-length service id which uniquely identifies each service cloud, and a variable-length, service-specific object id which speci-fies an object within a service cloud; 3) a new service layer that resides between the IP network layer and end-system layers for flexible support of service rout-ing and delivery.  The SOI architecture can potentially facilitate and enable the deployment of value-added services that will spur the further development of the Internet, and produce great benefits to the society in general. Furthermore, the understanding and insights to be gained as a result of this research will lead to the establishment of design principles, mechanisms, and guidelines for building and evolving the future Internet. \r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Admela Jukan\r\nProgram Director, CISE/CNS\r\nAug 5, 2004.\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
