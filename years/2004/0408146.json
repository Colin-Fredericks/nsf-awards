Lee\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly family environment can have profound effects on both the physical and behavioral development of individuals.  Being raised by two versus one parent or with or without siblings can influence growth rate and even adult behavior and personality of some animals and humans.  However, the interaction of early social conditions, defined as the family unit, and later behavior and personality are not yet well understood.  This study examines the early social conditions during the pre-weaning period on the personality and behavioral differences in a social rodent, the prairie vole.  Variable early social conditions include the presence or absence of the father, siblings, and the sex of siblings.  Personality is assessed through behavioral clusters that measure sociability and response to novelty, examined under controlled laboratory conditions.\r\n\r\n",
