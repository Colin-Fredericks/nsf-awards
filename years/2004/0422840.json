The long-term goal of this research is to understand the developmental regulation of shoot architecture in peas using a systems approach. Process-based, predictive models will be developed to integrate information about shoot development, especially inflorescence development, at multiple levels of organization. The evolution of inflorescence architecture involves a common toolkit of flowering genes used in different ways to create diverse morphologies, which can dramatically affect reproductive success. Creating and comparing systems-based models of shoot development in different species may reveal subtle variations that result in distinct patterns. For example, how are orthologs of Arabidopsis inflorescence architecture genes used in the development of pea inflorescences? A long history of the study of transmission genetics in pea has yielded many developmental mutants that alter shoot architecture. Many potential candidate genes for these mutants have been identified and cloned in Arabidopsis. The Singer lab plans to optimize these resources to continue to identify key regulatory genes in pea shoot architecture formation and investigate how they interact to create novel shoot morphologies.  \r\n\r\nThe current focus is on mutations affecting determinancy and asymmetry in pea. Gene expression studies, candidate gene testing, through mapping and cloning strategies, characterizing genetic interactions, and mathematically describing the spatial and temporal relationship between branching and organ initiation in pea will all further our understanding of inflorescence architecture. This understanding could lead to novel legume architectures that could increase yield. The work will provide opportunities for undergraduates to integrate mathematical approaches into the study of biological questions and foster collaboration with Australian researchers. \r\n",
