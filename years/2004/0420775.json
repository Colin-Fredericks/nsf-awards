 "awd_abstract_narration": "This MRI proposal seeks NSF funds to develop unique cross-disciplinary\r\nQuantum Engineering Laboratory for comprehensive characterization and development\r\nof future generation of information devices that are based on quantum principles.\r\nParticularly, we propose to develop new material characterization tool capable of\r\nsimultaneous millimeter-wave, magnetic resonance, and electrical experimental\r\nmeasurements (correlated spin and charge transport measurements) on arrays of single-\r\nelectron quantum dots and other novel semiconductor materials.\r\nIntellectual merit of the proposed activity. The principal features of the proposed\r\ntool are (1) milli-Kelvin temperature and high magnetic field capabilities, required to\r\nreach high spin polarization and a quantum regime for single-electron information\r\ndevices, and (2) capability for simultaneous electrical & magnetic measurement, required\r\nto examine the spin physics of charged carriers. Acquiring such a capability we will be\r\nable to understand the fundamental quantum physics in such systems and to exploit the\r\nspin degree of freedom for the new generation of information and communication devices\r\nthat are based on quantum principles.\r\nTo achieve these goals we propose to develop the first of its kind in the world\r\nmaterials characterization tool which will utilize high homogeneity (at least 10 ppm) 9 T\r\nmagnet with the cold-bore to accommodate a top-loading sorption refrigerator with the\r\nbase temperature of ca. 300 mK. It is proposed to develop a specialized top-loading\r\ninsert to conduct synchronized electrical measurements while the spin states are\r\nmanipulated by millimeter-wave pulses at 95, 130, and, possibly, 225 GHz. The\r\ninstrument will be also capable of comprehensive electrical characterization of quantum\r\ndot materials at high spin polarization states as well as for electron spin resonance (ESR)\r\nmeasurements to understand the mechanisms of relaxation and spin-spin coupling.\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed activity. The major impact of the proposed\r\nactivity will be in enhancing the infrastructure for research and education. Specifically,\r\ndevelopment of the Quantum Engineering Laboratory at NCSU fits the goal of the NSF\r\nMRI program because it will serve the following high priority areas: (1) to fill the gap\r\nbetween materials characterization facilities currently available in the USA and new\r\nquantum information devices which are theoretically proposed and which prototypes are\r\nalready fabricated and will be fabricated in the upcoming months; (2) to facilitate the\r\ndiscovery of fundamental phenomena in spin-coupled and other materials containing\r\nunpaired electron spins for quantum information processing; (3) to foster the integration\r\nof these multidisciplinary efforts in quantum information devices and technology and to\r\ntrain students in this emerging technology;\r\nWe are engaged in developing advanced instruction in this field through\r\nproviding courses in engineering and chemistry at NCSU. Specifically, it is proposed\r\nthat students and postdoctoral research associates will participate in all aspects of the\r\ninstrument development and materials research studies. To publicize the development of\r\nnext generation characterization tool it is proposed to hold a workshop during the grant\r\nperiod to educate the scientific community of this emerging technology. Twice a year, a\r\nshort training course for students at NCSU and UNC will be offered. The course\r\nmaterials will be made freely available via Internet.\r\nWe believe that these quantum electronic devices will become important to our\r\nNation and therefore are in support of the national research infrastructure. This belief is\r\nsupported by NSFs roadmap in information science and the developing roadmap in\r\nQuantum Computing being currently prepared by a coalition of government research\r\nfunding agencies.",
