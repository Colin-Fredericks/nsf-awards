 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this IERI project is to investigate the building of computational literacy both as a means of understanding domain knowledge and as a necessary skill for pursuing careers in science and engineering. The project builds upon previously funded NSF and Department of Energy projects that have worked at the intersections of education and computational science for over a decade to bring computational science and computational modeling strategies into the classroom teaching of mathematics and science. The project will build upon curriculum elements already developed in the areas of HS Biology, Earth Sciences, and Physics. These curriculum elements include a substantial number of computational science and computational models with the software supports that make the models usable in HS curriculum. The models are aligned with pedagogy and state standards. Master teachers will be involved in both the pedagogy support and the design of the curriculum using the modules as a \"virtual\" laboratory. In the experimental phase of the program, a randomized experiment comparing the new curriculum to the standard curriculum will be conducted in a variety of classrooms ranging from AP classes to general science classes and involving diverse student populations in Maryland, Iowa, and Tennessee. Student outcomes will be measured using instruments designed to show student problem understanding and solving capabilities and with standard tests such as NAEP. The broader impact of the project is reflected in its range of students and the possibility of improving science education for all Americans.",
