 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is becoming the definitive tool in the research and commercial analytical laboratory.  To better prepare its students for graduate school and professional employment, St. Ambrose University is incorporating the use of GC-MS throughout the chemistry curriculum.\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe project is adapting experiments from the educational literature, primarily from the Journal of Chemical Education, and is integrating those experiments into general chemistry and organic chemistry, and into advanced courses such as instrumental analysis and biochemistry.  Through the use of GC-MS, students are learning to separate complex mixtures and identify their components.  They are learning sampling techniques, use of external/internal standards, and single ion monitoring for rapid and reliable analysis.  They are challenged to apply GC-MS to solve a variety of chemical problems, some investigating and reinforcing basic chemical principles, and others that provide very practical applications.  This project also offers opportunity for the chemistry faculty to adapt experiments from the research literature in order to develop new GC-MS experiments in areas such as forensics, organic chemistry and physical chemistry.  Results of these activities will be disseminated widely. \r\nBroader Impact\r\nThis project impacts underrepresented groups since the majority of our students are women, and we rank in the upper quarter among Iowa four-year colleges and universities in our percentage of minority students.  GC-MS experience is especially enhancing the training of majors in environmental science and in criminalistics who will assume positions as laboratory chemists after graduation.  The work of such chemists is often of critical importance to society, and it is essential that their conclusions be accurate.  Careful training early in students' professional education with instrumentation they will routinely use is essential to assuring their competency.  \r\n",
