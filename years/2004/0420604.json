 "awd_abstract_narration": "A state-of-the-art multipurpose plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) reactor will be acquired that will enable the synthesis of highly aligned nanomaterials.  This equipment will form the basis of a nanostructured materials fabrication  (NMF) facility to expand the scope of current research efforts in nanoscience and engineering at University of Puerto Rico - Mayaguez  (UPRM).    The proposed NMF will be part of the new Materials Characterization Center  (MCC) at UPRM and will provide new and essential capabilities, in addition to dramatically increasing research productivity.    The new instrument will give researchers the capability to study nanomaterials from their synthesis process  using experimental and modeling tools to their use in innovative applications, including: (1) the use of nanotubes for the electrochemical detection of biomolecules, (2) production of nanotubes with tailored properties for hydrogen storage, (3) modeling of nanotubes-polymer matrix composites structural and mechanical properties, and (4) the synthesis of nanonitrides (whiskers and wires) via the VLS mechanisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe General Engineering Department will use this instrument in the \r\neducation and training of undergraduate students registered in the undergraduate research courses offered by the principal investigators, as well as a workshop tool for the graduate students involved in the projects. It will also become part of the new graduate courses being offered in coming semesters. This equipment will be a valuable addition to the existing Materials Science & Engineering infrastructure at UPRM and it will clearly improve the research and education capabilities of faculty members in the departments of General, Mechanical, Chemical and Electrical Engineering \r\nand of Chemistry and Physics. This multi-departmental interest will turn the NMF facility into a setting for the development of interdisciplinary projects. Hispanic students constitute over 95% of the Engineering students at UPRM (40% of them female). Therefore, the NMF facility will have a significant impact on the education of minority engineering students. \r\n",
