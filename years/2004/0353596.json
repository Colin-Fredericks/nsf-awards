 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Reid of Marquette University will conduct a variety of investigations on the spectroscopic, photophysical and photochemical properties of carbenes by means of linear and nonlinear spectroscopic techniques.  The work consists of two parts and will focus on the singlet-triplet gap between the lowest electronic states of these systems.  The first part will be devoted to the characterization of the spin-orbit gap and spin-orbit mediated interactions in a series of halocarbenes with a singlet electronic ground state and variable singlet-triplet gaps.  The photophysical and photochemistry of the halocarbenes will be studied in the second part.  Progress in the understanding of these properties has been impeded by experimental challenges owing to the reactive properties of the carbenes. Simple halocarbenes play an important role in the chemistry of the earth's upper atmosphere and this work will go a long way toward the improvement of our understanding of these reactive systems.  \r\n\r\nThis research will be conducted with graduate and undergraduate students who will acquire valuable training in contemporary physical chemistry.\r\n\r\n",
