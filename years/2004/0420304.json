 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program will support Old Dominion University with the acquisition of an ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The STM will provide single atom resolution and allow for laser-surface interaction. A load-lock will allow the transfer of samples from a growth chamber to the STM. Multi-disciplinary reseach to be performed with this STM include: (a) electronic-induced surface structural modification; (b) ultrafast surface phase transitions; (c) surface etching by atomic hydrogen; (d) growth of thin films, nanocrystals and quantum dots by femtosecond pulsed laser depostion; (e) studies of organic electroactive polymers for electronic and/or photonic devices; (f) structural-dependent nanoparticle optics; (g) morphology studies for synthesis of carbon nanotubes; and (h) surface modifications with microwave discharges. Graduate and undergraduate students will perform research with the STM and gain training in thin film growth, surface and nanocrystal characterization, and ultrahigh vacuum technology.\r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation award supports Old Dominion University with the acquisition of an ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with single atom resolution. This STM will be used to study electronic and optical materials, thin films, and nanoparticles. Graduate and undergraduate students will be using the STM to perform their research and gain training in thin film growth, surface modification, surface and nanocrystal characterization, and ultrahigh vacuum technology. The use of this STM will enhance the interdisciplinary (e.g. chemistry, electrical engineering, material science, and physics) educational environment for our students and will be integrated in graduate and undergraduate courses presently offered in engineering and sciences. This instrument will be used to highlight to the students the importance of relating atomic scale materials characteristics to macroscopic properties, and how surface properties affect electronic materials, polymers, and nanotechnology. \r\n",
