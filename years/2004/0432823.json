 "awd_abstract_narration": "The funding is requested to hold a workshop to discuss how best to put in place a mechanism to ensure the best planning, allocation, management and scientific support for the shared resources required for the Cosmology and Astrophysics experiments at the U.S. Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, i.e., experiments within the Dark Sector. Examples where coordination among the many current and planned projects include, liquid helium supply and allocation, power allocation and future needs, Dark Sector model machine shop supply, maintenance and operation, Dark Sector mechanical and electronics support, a voice for science IT and future data transmission, science cargo needs, coordination of science population constraints, synergy of winter-over talent, etc. Discussion and presentations at the workshop will focus on: (1) conveying the shared resources requirements and logistical needs of the current and possible future Cosmology and Astrophysics projects at the South Pole, and (2) possible operational models to coordinate the needed support. The goal of the workshop is to develop and agree upon a model for a scientifically motivated organization to coordinate and support the shared resources for the Dark Sector at the South Pole. The Intellectual Merit of the proposed activity is the developing an understanding of, and communicating, the enormous potential of the South Pole for Cosmological and Astrophysical research. The Broader Impacts resulting from the proposed activity will be increased scientific productivity of the South Pole Station through more efficient use of shared resources and through communicating and understanding the logistical needs required to conduct the best science in the future.\r\n",
