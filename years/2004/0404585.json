Professor Zaera and his coworkers at the University of California-Riverside use infrared spectroscopy coupled with a high pressure nanoliter sized catalytic reactor to probe the detailed kinetics of hydrocarbon reactions on transition metal surfaces.  An understanding of the detailed kinetics of these reactions is crucial to the design of improved catalysts for hydrocarbon processing chemistry.  The work of the Zaera group includes extensive and long term collaborations with scientists in Latin America.\r\n\r\nAn understanding of catalytic selectivity is necessary in order to design and implement improved catalytic processes for hydrocarbon conversions.  This improved understanding can impact energy conversion technologies, the industrial production of hydrocarbon feedstocks, and the catalytic production of fine chemicals.  The work in Professor Zaera's laboratory at the University of California-Riverside addresses this question of selectivity by carrying out fundamental studies of surface reaction kinetics on well characterized transition metal substrates, using infrared spectroscopy and a novel nanoliter reactor method.  Outreach to researchers in Latin America is included in this research project. \r\n\r\n",
