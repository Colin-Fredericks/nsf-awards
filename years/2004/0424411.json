 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will concentrate on compact circuit simulation models for silicon carbide (SiC) devices that will be released for commercialization in the near future. Namely, static-induction-transistor (SIT), JFET, BJT and IGBT devices will be investigated. Specifically, the project objectives are to: (1) Characterize SiC SIT, JFET, BJT, and IGBT power switches, (2) Design & develop models for the SIT, JFET, BJT, and IGBT, (3) Validate versus measurements the SiC power device models, and (4) Validate SiC power device models by demonstration in key power electronics applications.\r\n\r\nPower electronic designers need compact models because they rely on computer simulation for insight into the details of the operation of their circuits. The designer analyzes the robustness of designs through a number of model-based studies such as dynamic thermal analysis, worst-case analysis, and statistical variability in circuit performance due to manufacturing tolerances. \r\n\r\nThe original NSF GOALI on this topic has already created significant impact within the power electronics and modeling communities, as well as providing for solid foundations for partnerships. During the duration of the original project, the SiC devices we have modeled have already begun to appear on the commercial market. Nine combined semesters of co-ops and internships for students have been realized, including students working at NIST and NASA-Glenn. A total of six undergraduates and seven students from underrepresented groups participated in research projects.     \r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks to continue the significant achievements accomplished by the original award. Collaborators at Northrop Grumman, NIST, NASA-Glenn, the Army Research Labs, and Caracal will provide access to SiC devices, facilities, personnel expertise, and summer employment to the UA researchers throughout the duration of the renewed project.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this NSF GOALI proposal include: (1) Developing state-of-the-art science in the field of silicon carbide power electronics, (2) Providing research opportunities for underrepresented and minority students, and (3) Disseminating into the public domain advanced power device models for circuit designers.\r\n",
