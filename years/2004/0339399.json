 "awd_abstract_narration": "0339399\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project addresses issues related to verication and debugging of application\r\nspecic integrated circuits (ASICs) and systems on chip (SOCs) and proposes a novel solution to\r\ndrastically improve efficiency and performance of design verication.  The design verication\r\nalready dominates the overall design development time and negatively impacts the designer pro-\r\nductivity and product's time to market. The proposed method is based on a novel technology, called \r\ntestbench caching, which reduces by the several orders of magnitude the HW/SW communication \r\noverhead. It is combined with the technique that also reduces the need for frequent and time \r\nintensive design compilation, and increased signal visibility, essential for fast hardware \r\ndebugging. Over 100 times improvement is expected w.r.to traditional simulation, and 10-20 \r\ntimes w.r.to traditional simulation acceleration. This project will result in the development of \r\na prototype system to validate the above claims.\r\n\r\nBy accelerating the verication and providing efficient debugging facility the proposed solution\r\nwill substantially shorten time to market for ASIC and SOC designs. Designers productivity will\r\nincrease, lowering product development and labor costs. The proposed system methodology will\r\nhave a signicant, positive commercial impact and will contribute to the growth of the verication\r\nsystems market.",
