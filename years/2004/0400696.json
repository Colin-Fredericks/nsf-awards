 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop fundamental understanding of failure mechanics of microcircuit packaging and MEMS packaging at high strain rates.  The objective will be achieved through three major thrusts including, characterization of initiation and progression of failure mechanisms in integrated circuits during drop impact, study of materials and interfaces under high strain rates encountered during drop, and development of models for prediction of failure.  Materials and material interfaces of microcircuit and MEMs packages will be studied including, SnPb and Pb-free solders, copper metallization and pads, printed circuit laminates, semiconductors, and molding compounds.  Test structures will be developed to study material constitutive behavior, and damage threshold relationships.  Strain rates in the range of 101 to 102 sec-1 will be used for characterization.  Computational models will be developed for prediction of microcircuit survivability in shock and accidental drop environments.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit of the proposed research is the fundamental structured approach to design damage tolerant electronics which will be available for system designers, based on predictability in design performance of microcircuits in shock and accidental drop environments.  An advanced design framework will reduce dependence on experimental methods for evaluation of system performance and help reduce cost and time.  The proposed research will be a significant advancement over the state-of-the-art.  The broader impact and outreach activities of this project will target course development, focused sessions at conferences, special issues in electronic packaging journals, and introduction of elementary school children and undergraduates to portable electronics through lab tours and in-class presentations.  \r\n",
