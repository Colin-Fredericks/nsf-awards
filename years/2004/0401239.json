 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal has three components. The first\r\ndescribes recent collaboration with Kavita Ramanan (Carnegie-Mellon \r\nUniversity) and David Galvin (postdoc, Microsoft) on Gibbs measures, \r\nwith applications to stochastic networks. Motivation\r\nfrom these and related networks raises new and qualitatively different\r\nquestions concerning regions of phase uniqueness and coexistence, which\r\nare being investigated.  The second component describes ongoing research with\r\nSergey Bobkov (University of Minnesota) on \r\nmodified versions of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities \r\nand applications to convergence to stationarity of finite  Markov chains.\r\nThis work is carried over to more recent research activity\r\nwith graduate student, Marcus Sammer and colleague, Wilfrid Gangbo\r\non discrete transportation problems.\r\nIn particular, the final component is on developing discrete calculus\r\nto study  aspects of mass transport, Ricci curvature, and \r\nunderstanding connections between various\r\nrelavant inequalities -- the transportation inequality, \r\nTalagrand's inequality, the entropy inequality and logarithmic\r\nSobolev type inequalities. In  continuous settings\r\n(such as on R^n or on Riemannian manifolds), there are intimate\r\nconnections between the above-mentioned 2nd and 3rd topics; however\r\nthese are yet to be established to satisfaction in the discrete\r\nsettings of finite metric measure spaces.\r\nDue to the richness in applications, we find development\r\nof such an analogous theory  worthwhile and fruitful.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposal intends to explore the behavior and performance\r\nof telecommunication (and other data) networks \r\nunder recently-suggested  models of multicasting and unicasting\r\non large grid-like structures. Preliminary investigations of the PI and \r\ncollaborators demonstrate that the introduction of unicast calls brings\r\nin a certain symmetry breaking into the system, and\r\nlets the system carry a higher load of multicast calls\r\nbefore the system succumbs to call-blocking  due to the influence\r\nof what might be imposed on the boundary of the large (grid-like) region.\r\nRelated questions address understanding the spread of information (genetic\r\nor otherwise) and the spread of disease in tree-like and grid-like environment.\r\nThese and other  research objectives outlined in this proposal are of \r\ninterest to researchers in analysis, combinatorics, probability, \r\ninformation theory, statistical physics and the theory of computing. \r\nOne of the main motivations for the PI comes from computational and applied\r\nproblems of combinatorics and discrete probability. An overarching\r\ntheme  of the proposal is also to explore in depth\r\nthe role of information theoretic techniques in discrete probability\r\nand computing. The PI fully hopes his extended collaboration \r\nwith his coauthors in these disparate research topics contributes to the\r\ncross-fertilization of mathematical ideas, modeling, and techniques,\r\nwhile promoting the educational component of research.\r\n",
