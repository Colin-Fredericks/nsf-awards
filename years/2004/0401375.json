The newly developed sensor is the key component in development of a remote wireless sensing system to detect chemical agents.  The sensor will consist of an electromagnetic resonator integrated with vertically aligned carbon nanotubes used as a chemical transducer.  The carbon nanotube resonator sensor is a passive sensing device and requires no power consumption.  Passive sensor and zero power consumption address the challenges in the development of wireless sensor networks that employ numerous sensor nodes.  The contactless sensor is important in applications that prohibit the use of wiring.   The microwave carbon nanotube resonator sensor exhibits changes in resonant frequency when exposed to gasses.  An array of antennas will be designed and incorporated into the carbon nanotube resonator sensor to communicate with a remote wireless reading system.  He will develop a remote wireless reading system to probe the sensor.  The major tasks of this research include: (1) development of microwave carbon nanotube resonator sensor to detect chemical agents, and (2) development of a wireless remote sensing system using microwave carbon nanotube resonator sensors up to 20 GHz.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The advancement of sensors is a national need with broad ranges of applications in health care, the food industry, chemical industry, environmental monitoring and national security. The detection of chemical agents remotely is particular importance and a critical element in the development of wireless sensor networks. The remote detection is crucial in applications where wires are prohibited.  The underlying sensing mechanism is passive, and such sensors are critical to power management of wireless networks that use numerous sensor nodes.  The sensor can be integrated on a printed circuit board for practical applications.  The research will enhance the understanding of the interaction occurring between gas molecules, their environment, and microwave electromagnetic signals.  The use of emerging carbon nanotube materials will open numerous possibilities for the development of sensors that can detect new toxic and biological agents.  \r\n\r\nThe primary education goal is to attract domestic student candidates to pursue graduate studies, especially doctoral research.  His plan is to develop interdisciplinary projects that combine traditional microwave engineering, life science and nanotechnologies.  This combination will provide rich, exciting, and novel research projects that will be attractive to graduate students.  \r\n",
