 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate the combination of two or more materials in the form of nanocomposite in making microstructures for Microelectromechanical Systems applications.  The first research task focuses on metal-organic/inorganic nanocomposites by adding nanoparticles into microstructures in order to modify and strengthen the material properties and alleviate the mechanical deficiency such as fatigue and aging with the advantage of low temperature processing and feasibility for direct integration with microelectronics.  The architecture of these microstructures is based on suspended mechanical microstructures made of nanocomposite for micro actuators or sensors such as inertial sensors applications.  The second research task aims to study conductive-polymer based nanocomposite made by encapsulating nano substances such as chemicals, enzymes, or biomarkers into microstructures for biosensor applications.  The architecture is based on the micro-gap structures that will be filled with conductive nanocomposite with in situ encapsulated nanoparticles such as enzymes for bio-sensing applications.  \r\n\r\nElectrosynthesized nanocomposite will create a wide range of novel sensor applications for Microelectromechanical systems such as high frequency mechanical resonators that perform as precision filters in wireless communication systems, and disposable glucose sensors that assist daily life of diabetic patients.  For industry, this research will provide potential industrial applications with (a) advanced manufacturing capability of nanocomposite for microstructures and (b) new ways to interact with micro systems using nanocomposite integrated with microelectronics.  For the academic world, results of the proposed research will open a new area in nanocomposite-based design, manufacturing and applications.\r\n",
