Attendance is limited to about 60-75 participants.  This is the first meeting that has focussed entirely on the disks of hot stars as a class. Recent improvements in observational data and new theoretical developments make the time right for just such a meeting. Each day there are three sessions,  falling under the themes Properties of Disks, The Star-Disk Connection, and Magnetic Fields in Hot Stars.   Some talks that deal more generally with disk physics and disks of cooler stars, are included to promote cross-fertilization in the discipline.  A panel format session  orchestrates group discussion on these topics in the early afternoons. A unique component of the meeting is the inclusion of \"Focus Sessions\" in the late afternoons that are tutorial in nature,  lending a kind of \"summer-school flavor\" to the meeting. The focus topics include Diagnostics, Modeling Issues, and Optical/IR Interferometry.  The Focus Sessions are designed to interest graduate students and junior scientists, as well as providing information for non-specialists in these particular areas.  Proceedings for the workshop will be published with the ASP Conference Series, and abstracts for the review talks and poster contributions will be made available through the internet. \r\n***\r\n",
