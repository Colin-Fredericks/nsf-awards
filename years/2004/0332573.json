The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-03521).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners include Drexel University (Lead Institution), Pennsylvania State University-Great Valley, Temple University, Thomas Jefferson University, University of Pennsylvania, University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Fox Chase Cancer Research Center, Wistar Institute, and BioAdvance-The Biotechnology Greenhouse Corporation (an alliance of the biopharmaceutical industry in the Philadelphia region).\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of this award is to \"transform knowledge into innovation in computational biotechnology in SE Pennsylvania. This is accomplished through developing training and education programs in bioinformatics, creating a virtual network of universities, industry, government agencies, and venture capitalists; promoting interdisciplinary teamwork; and supporting innovative business plans for commercially viable knowledge-based biotechnology ventures. The alliance activities have four main objectives that are interrelated and complementary: developing and maintaining a skilled workforce; creating a robust bioinformatics network; a \"computational orchestra\" that will catalyze and capture innovation in bioinformatics and biomedicine; and help create an infrastructure for commercialization of innovation. The activities also include development of multi-level, comprehensive and results-oriented educational and training programs to create and maintain a skilled bioinformatics workforce, from graduate level to continuing education.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\nThe Greater Philadelphia region is home to approximately 80 percent of the pharmaceutical employment in the U.S. and is rich in medical institutions, medical colleges, and biotechnology startup businesses. The grant will transform the wealth of biology and computational science resources in the regional universities and research institutions into innovation to accelerate the growth of the life sciences industry in the region. The activities will create new companies and jobs, and provide the workforce for those jobs.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the activity lies in providing an integrated effort from fundamental research in biological and computational sciences, creating a multilevel education and training program in bioinformatics, and support innovation in the region.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the activity concentrate on creating a new education program that seamlessly integrates curricula at the vocational and high school level to the community college level to undergraduate and graduate degrees at on of several regional universities. Underrepresented groups will be involved in all of the activities of the grant.\r\n",
