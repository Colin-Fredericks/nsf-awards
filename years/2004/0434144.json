 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Noyce Fellowship Program at the University of Colorado at Boulder is an enhancement of the STEM Teacher Preparation (STEM-TP) project, a collaboration between the School of Education and four mathematics and science research departments. Collaborative, student-centered learning is introduced into large-enrollment courses by employing talented undergraduate STEM majors as Learning Assistants. Learning Assistants are then recruited to become K-12 teachers. Through the Noyce Program, substantial fellowships are provided to help overcome barriers that these students face in obtaining their teaching licensure. The program identifies and recruits STEM majors into the teaching profession at any time during their undergraduate careers, and includes both a post-baccalaureate and a Master's Degree program. Noyce Fellows teach in high-needs schools and participate in an induction program where they receive intensive mentoring and support. The STEM-TP/Noyce program addresses fundamental issues in education, including: (1) the advantages of and barriers to collaborative learning in large enrollment settings; (2) the development of pedagogical skills and attitudes toward K-12 teaching among STEM majors; (3) the development of attitudes of faculty members regarding student-centered learning and the responsibility of preparing K-12 teachers; and (4) the induction and retention of new teachers in high-needs schools.",
