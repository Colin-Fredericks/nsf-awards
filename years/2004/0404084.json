 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to establish the potential of nano-patterned ultrathin epitaxial graphite for low-power, nanometer-scale electronic devices.  The research is inspired by the exceptional electronic properties of carbon nanotubes, and the realization that these essential properties are shared by all nanographitic structures.  Rationally patterned planar graphite (or graphene - a single atomic layer of graphite) structures have advantages over nanotubes in that connections between devices can be accomplished in a single lithographic step.  The research approach is to 1) Produce extended defect-free multilayered graphene, 0.3--3 nm thick, on silicon carbide substrates; 2) Develop patterning methods; 3) Establish electronic and transport properties of extended films and defined structures; 4) Develop chemical modification (doping) methods; 5) Demonstrate simple devices; and 6) Establish methods to integrate with Si-based electronics. \r\n\r\n\r\nEnergy conservation and mobile operation demand that future electronics focus on low power and high-density.  Graphite-based electronics holds the potential for large-scale integration of ballistic (dissipationless) devices that could satisfy these needs. This program provides in-depth training for Ph.D. students in nanoscience/engineering, and research/education opportunities at several levels.  Through Georgia Tech programs designed by education professionals, high-school teachers can be hosted in research laboratories.  U.S. undergraduates can participate in the research through two NSF-REU programs (with additional opportunities available in Georgia).  Contributions to courses within Georgia Tech's Nanoscience and Technology program will reach a wider audience. Finally, a focus on recruitment of underrepresented groups into nanoscience and engineering will be maintained.\r\n",
