 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the proposed two-year project, the PIs will provide the first modern evaluation of the\r\nlate Paleozoic Gondwanan glaciation in eastern Australia. Currently, the data and observations\r\non which the interpretations of the glacial record in eastern Australia are based predate the\r\nscientific advances in the field of glacial geology of the past thirty years and, as such, have made\r\nit difficult to incorporate information from the region into global reviews of the issue. The\r\nrationale for the proposed project is that until new sedimentological and geochemical data are\r\ngathered and resolved into a robust stratigraphic framework, understanding of the late Paleozoic\r\nice age in eastern Australia, and how it fits into the global picture, cannot be advanced. The\r\nproposed project will build upon the results of previous studies carried out by the PIs in\r\nQueensland and New South Wales, Australia, and will benefit from recently improved age\r\nconstraints for the Carboniferous system of New South Wales. This investigation will include:\r\n(1) collection of sedimentological data from key areas in New South Wales, Australia; (2)\r\ngeneration of stable isotopic proxy records of climate change derived from climate-sensitive\r\ncalcareous components; and (3) correlation of interpreted glacial periods with other areas in\r\nAustralia and other Gondwanan continents. The applicants are uniquely qualified to carry out\r\nthis research, having the necessary sedimentological and geochemical skills and experience, a\r\ncombined twenty years research experience in the field area, and a considerable inventory of\r\nrelevant, preliminary data.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe proposed research will contribute to a developing global re-evaluation\r\nof the late Paleozoic iaicehouselo period, and as such will have relevance and significance to a\r\nbroad range of geoscientists. It is anticipated that the results from this work will, among other\r\noutcomes, contribute to increasingly sophisticated numerical models of past climates which are\r\nnow being used iteratively to provide estimates of rates and magnitudes of climate change\r\nthrough geologic time. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nBecause participation in scientific research plays a strong, positive role in\r\nguiding student perceptions of career opportunities in science, both undergraduate and graduate\r\nstudents will be included in research activities. Students will be involved in data gathering and\r\ninterpretation, and will be encouraged to publish outcomes and participate in professional\r\nmeetings. Students from groups traditionally under-represented in the geosciences will be\r\ntargeted for participation. The PIs will work with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Office of\r\nTrio Programs to identify students from these groups. Results of the proposed research will be\r\nincorporated into education activities, presented at professional meetings, and published in peer-\r\nreviewed journals. The benefits to society, though indirect, are certainly tangible in the\r\ncontribution made to input parameters for numerical models of climate change.",
