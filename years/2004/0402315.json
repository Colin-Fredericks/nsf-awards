 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award uses funds to help obtain a 130,000-year high-resolution record of climate from speleothems in the mid-continent of North America.  The primary field site, Crevice Cave, Missouri, was located south of the former Laurentide Ice Sheet during the past interglacial-glacial cycle.  The researchers hypothesize that the site is well situated to record changes in mid-continent climate, global climate variability, and vegetation changes during interglacial-glacial cycles.  \r\n \r\nPrevious studies by the researchers indicate that speleothems from Crevice Cave have grown continuously over tens of thousands of years.  The researchers expect to produce a high-resolution stable isotope record, dated by the Thorium-230 technique, from the North American mid-continent covering most of the last interglacial-glacial cycle.   \r\n\r\nThis research will provide a unique educational experience for graduate and undergraduate students and will help improve our knowledge of Holocene climate variability of North America from a new paleoclimate data archive.",
