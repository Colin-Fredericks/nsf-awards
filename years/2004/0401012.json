 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Shimozono studies combinatorial structures arising in\r\nrepresentation theory and algebraic geometry. With\r\nAllen Knutson and Ezra Miller, he proved a conjecture of Buch\r\nand Fulton for the torus equivariant cohomology classes of\r\ndegeneracy loci associated with an equioriented type A quiver,\r\nwhich generalizes the Giambelli-Thom-Porteous formula for\r\ndeterminantal varieties. He will study the equivariant K-theoretic\r\nand cohomology classes of degeneracy loci associated with other\r\nquivers. This research has applications to the Schubert calculus\r\nand the geometry of flag varieties. Shimozono will continue his\r\nresearch on combinatorial problems arising in the representation\r\ntheory of classical and affine Lie algebras and Weyl groups. With\r\nMike Zabrocki, he has discovered new creation operators for\r\ncharacters of classical type, which, together with crystal graph\r\ntechniques, will be applied to the problem of finding explicit\r\ncombinatorial formulae for affine Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. He\r\nalso plans to continue his study of crystal bases of\r\nfinite-dimensional modules over quantum affine algebras, with\r\napplications to branching and fusion multiplicities in conformal\r\nfield theories and statistical mechanics.\r\n\r\nShimozono's research on quiver loci is related to some classical\r\nmathematics with current applications. For example, the cohomology\r\nclasses of quiver loci may be viewed as polynomials which\r\ngeneralize the classical polynomials known as subresultants.\r\nSubresultants are used in computer algebra systems to efficiently\r\ncompute the greatest common divisor of a collection of\r\npolynomials, and may also be used to find the number of common\r\nzeroes of a pair of polynomials without factoring them. His\r\nresearch on affine crystal bases involves the study of certain\r\nhighly symmetrical graphs with colored edges. The symmetries\r\nexhibited by these graphs appear in many areas of mathematics and\r\nphysics, such as in the low-temperature behavior of statistical\r\nmechanical models involving particles situated on a\r\ntwo-dimensional lattice.\r\n",
