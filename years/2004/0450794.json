 "awd_abstract_narration": "Absent an adequate language to talk about change and the direction of change, science\r\ncurricula are fundamentally constrained to over-emphasize static constructs like\r\ntaxonomies and memorized sequences of events. In contrast with these over-simplified,\r\nstatics-based curricula, the world students live in is complex and dynamic. A\r\nfundamental disconnect is created between what learners know of their world and the\r\ncurrent statics-based science they are taught in school. In addition to moving toward a\r\nmath of change strand in school curricula and early university curricula (e.g. early non-calculus\r\nsciences), a full dynamics-based curriculum needs to address the directed-ness\r\nwe experience in the world around us. When we get up in the morning, energy always\r\nflows from our warm feet to the cold floor and never the other way around. The second\r\nlaw of thermodynamics  the entropy law  is the only law of science that allows\r\nlearners to understand the directed-ness of physical process. Replacing statics-based\r\ncurricula with a full dynamics-based reform depends vitally on being able to talk about\r\nchange but also on being able to talk about the direction of change. Recent educational\r\ninnovations related to the early introduction of the math of change  e.g. the use of\r\nmotion detectors and powerful simulation software  are starting to find their way into\r\nsignificant curricular reform. Unfortunately, entropy related fundamental research,\r\nmaterials development, and course-work aimed at advancing the dynamic-based\r\nunderstanding of all learners is all but non-existent. This grant is aimed at addressing\r\nthis critical missing element in pursuing dynamics-based reform.\r\nOver a decade of entropy-based research and innovation leads me to believe that\r\nentropy ideas can be incorporated into learning about energy dynamics early on in\r\nscience education, that entropy can be taught in a way that is cross-disciplinary and cross-level\r\n(from the very small to the very large), and that moving in this direction not only\r\nadvances student understanding of entropy but that the ability of all students to better\r\nunderstand and succeed, at virtually all levels of their science learning, is significantly\r\nadvanced. Although I intend for this entropy-focused work to impact science learning\r\nfrom late elementary through the wide range of undergraduate science courses, my\r\nprimary focus will be on two critical junctures in students' lives relative to formal\r\nscience learning: early high school and early university level work. Coming into these\r\njunctures many students are \"still in the game\" and are interested in further science\r\nstudy. Coming out of these junctures many students decide to leave, especially students\r\nfrom under-represented groups. Courses taught at these levels will serve both as\r\ntestbeds for the efficacy of entropy-based learning and as research settings. In schools, I\r\nwill focus primarily on the state-mandated, ninth-grade Integrated Physics and Chemistry\r\ncourse. At the university level I will focus on a newly developed undergraduate science\r\ncourse titled Entropy and Energy that I will co-teach with a research physicist who is also\r\nCo-Director of the completely restructured and rapidly growing new secondary\r\ncertification program called UTeach. Domain courses, such as this, in the new UTeach\r\nprogram are to model Standards-based teaching at the university level. Research\r\ninsights related to student learning as such  learning with entropy  will be integrated\r\nwith my newly developed Knowing and Learning course that is the first required\r\neducation course for all the UTEACH students. Through the establishment of a work\r\ncircle of teachers in schools, through the establishment of a brown-bag seminar series at\r\nthe university, through research presentations and publications, and through the\r\ndevelopment of a Learning Entropy and Energy (LEEP) website, this project is intended\r\nto support a larger conversation related to the efficacy and significance of learning about\r\nand with entropy as a vital part of moving towards a dynamics-based curriculum for all\r\nstudents.",
