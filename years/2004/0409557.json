The primary focus of the project is to exploit structural compliance to enhance microbearing system performance, with surface coatings being a secondary concern. This project is expected to form a framework to lead researchers into combining more complex bearing structures with particular surface coatings.  The proposed test bearing is comprised of a free rotor with compliant surfaces that rotates about a fixed, rigid hub through the action of an external air jet. Computational studies have indicated that a rotor comprised of a compliant bearing surface has substantially higher load capacity than that obtained with a conventional rigid rotor.  Particular emphasis of the project is to develop a reliable and repeatable fabrication method and test protocol to understand the effects of elasticity, surface roughness, load, and speed on microbearing surface wear. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project will lead to the development of reliable MEMS-based microturbine, micropump, and microactuator components that can be readily integrated into larger micropower and lab-on-chip systems. The broader impact of the project will be accomplished through tribology-based laboratory sessions aimed at under-represented groups in the Rochester area, along with integration of research results into a multidisciplinary and graduate microsystems curriculum being developed at RIT.\r\n\r\n",
