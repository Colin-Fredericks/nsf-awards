Blaine Lawson, Jr.\r\n\r\nThis project is concerned with the study of cycles, residues,\r\nboundaries and differential characters.  The proposal has several\r\ninterrelated parts.  The first concerns the groups of algebraic\r\ncycles and cocycles on a projective variety $X$.  The aim is to\r\nrelate these groups to the global structure of $X$.  The\r\ninvestigator has, with others, established a theory of homology\r\ntype for algebraic varieties based on the homotopy groups of\r\ncycles spaces. This theory will be used to study concrete\r\nquestions about algebraic spaces.  Implications for real\r\nalgebraic geometry will be explored.  Striking onnections to\r\nuniversal constructions in topology which emerged in prior\r\nresearch will also be investigated. A second part of the proposal\r\nconcerns cycles which bound complex subvarieties in a projective\r\nmanifold.  Several new conjectures relate these cycles to\r\napproximation theory, pluripotential theory, and the projective\r\nspectrum of Banach graded algebras.  A third area of the proposal\r\nconcerns the study of singularities and characteristic\r\nforms. This subject includes a generalization of Chern-Weil\r\ntheory which gives canonical homologies between singularities of\r\nbundle maps and characteristic forms. It includes a useful\r\nanalytic tool -- geometric atomicity -- which will be studied,\r\nand it yields a new approach to Morse Theory. Applications\r\nrelating singularities to global geometry remain to be\r\ninvestigated. The forth part of the proposal concerns sparks and\r\nspark complexes. This recently developed framework for the study\r\nof differential characters has yielded interesting\r\ngeneralizations which extend Deligne cohomology and arithmetic\r\nChow groups. They are essentially secondary invariants which\r\nmediate between cycles and smooth data. Further development of\r\nthe theory and its application to the study of cycles is\r\nproposed. A fifth area is concerned with special cycles in\r\ngeometry, in particular Special Lagrangian cycles in Calabi-Yau\r\nmanifolds, and associative and Cayley cycles in $G_2$ and\r\nSpin$_7$ spaces. These latter subjects relate to mirror symmetry\r\nconjectures and to M-theory in Physics as well as many areas of\r\ngeometry and algebra. This project will also be concerned with\r\nstudent development, including an undergraduate educational\r\neffort aimed at fostering mathematical independence and\r\ndeveloping interactive enviornments.\r\n\r\nA concept of central importance in geometry is that of a\r\n``cycle''.  In algebraic geometry a cycle corresponds to the\r\nsimultaneous solution of a system of polynomial equations. In\r\ndifferential geometry they arise in many ways: as the large scale\r\nsolutions of certain differential equations, and as the level\r\nsets and singularity sets of differentiable mappings.  Curves and\r\nsurfaces in space are simple examples.  Cycles with a particular\r\ngeometry also play a fundamental role in modern physical theories\r\n\r\nThis proposal is concerned with the study of cycles across this\r\nbroad spectrum. In the algebraic setting cycles have been related\r\nto fundamental large-scale geometry of their surrounding\r\nspace. This discovery has revealed surprizing and important\r\nrelationships between spaces of algebraic cycles and fundamental\r\nconstructions in algebraic topology and has led to new insights\r\nin both fields.  This work will be continued.\r\n\r\nAnother area of investigation concerns cycles which form the\r\nboundary of subsets with special geometric structure.  They\r\nrepresent non-linear versions of classical boundary value\r\nproblems in analysis. Such questions arise in many contexts.\r\nRecently the proposer has formulated conjectures relating certain\r\nimportant classes of such cycles to questions in approximation\r\ntheory and Banach algebras. Successful resolution should produce\r\nsignificant new insights in several fields of mathematics.\r\n\r\nA third area of study concerns a mathematical apparatus developed\r\nby the proposer to detect subtle relationships between cycles and\r\nthe global structure of the space they live in.  This apparatus\r\nencompasses some of the most effective tools historically\r\ndeveloped for this purpose, and it is much more general. Further\r\ndevelopment of this theory and its applications will be persued.\r\n\r\nA fourth domain of investigation is concerned with special cycles\r\nin geometry: Special Lagrangian cycles in Calabi-Yau manifolds,\r\nand associative and Cayley cycles in G(2) and Spin(7) spaces.\r\nThese latter subjects relate to gauge field theory and gravity in\r\nPhysics\r\n\r\nThis project will also be concerned with graduate student\r\ndevelopment.  Students will be part of the research team.  There\r\nwill also be an undergraduate educational effort aimed at\r\nfostering mathematical independence and developing interactive\r\nenvironments.\r\n",
