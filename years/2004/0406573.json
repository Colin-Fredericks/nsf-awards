 "awd_abstract_narration": "Noncommutative Algebraic Invariants in Low-Dimensional Topology\r\n\r\nThis project will discover the topological significance of certain \r\nhighly noncommutative algebraic invariants of low-dimensional manifolds. \r\nIf X is a topological space and G is its fundamental group, then \r\nassociated to any normal subgroup H of G is a covering space of X \r\nwhose homology groups are modules over the integral group ring of the \r\nquotient group G/H. When G/H is commutative, these modules have played \r\na central role in the applications of algebraic topology to the problems \r\nof topology. For example, if X is the exterior of a link L of circles \r\nin S3 and H is the commutator subgroup, then these modules are called \r\nAlexander modules of L. This project investigates these  \"higher-order\"\r\n modules in more general situations, especially where the subgroup H \r\nis an element of the derived series of G. Families of modules that \r\ngeneralize the Alexander module are thus obtained. Although these are \r\nmodules over noncommutative rings, they share many important properties \r\nwith the Alexander module. If X is a manifold then there are also Hermitian \r\nforms and linking forms defined on these modules, giving additional structure. \r\nThis project investigates these structures and their applications. With the \r\nhelp of techniques of noncommutative algebra and functional analysis, one observes \r\nnew noncommutative phenomena in knot theory, 3-dimensional manifolds, 4-dimensional \r\nmanifolds and in surface homeomorphisms. In particular the project will find more \r\nstructure in the group of topological concordance classes of knots; find structure \r\nin the monoid of all isotopy classes of knots; will investigate this monoid modulo \r\ncertain equivalence relations involving \"gropes\"; will find new information about \r\nthe depth of foliations of 3-manifolds, and will find new invariants of 3-manifolds, \r\nand mapping class groups.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of quantum mechanics, scientists in the late twentieth century \r\nhave become increasingly aware that describing the structure of the universe \r\nwill necessitate noncommutative mathematics. In multiplying numbers, \r\n2 times 3 = 3 times 2. But particles are now known to behave more like matrices, \r\nand matrix multiplication is not commutative, i.e. AB is not in general equal to BA. \r\nYet, until recently, even in the field of mathematics itself commutative algebra and \r\nlinear techniques have played the greater role, simply because noncommutative algebra \r\nis very difficult. To understand the finer structure of 4-dimensional space-time, of \r\n3-dimensional space and of string theory, it will be necessary to understand the full \r\nrole of noncommutative algebraic structures.  This project lays the mathematical f\r\noundations for the use of noncommutative algebraic topology in the study of 3 and \r\n4-dimensional manifolds and in knot theory. In addition, since a high percentage of \r\nthe research assistants of the PI are U.S. women, and since women are under-represented \r\nin the field of research mathematics, this project will contribute to the increase in \r\nthe scientific potential of the United States. \r\n\r\n \r\n",
