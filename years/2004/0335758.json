 "awd_abstract_narration": "Molecular evolution is a field in rapid transformation. In large part, this transformation is the result of an explosion of raw sequence information (from whole genome and large scale sequencing projects) that can only be interpreted using the comparative tools of molecular evolution.  One outcome is that molecular evolution has shifted from being a subdiscipline of evolution to an expansive and overarching discipline that now informs almost every aspect of the biological sciences.  The 2004 Gordon Research Conference on Molecular Evolution will highlight the expansive nature of the field, by incorporating sessions that range from network evolution to patterns of human genetic diversity and from the evolution of genome complexity to adaptive evolution in plants. In addition, it will explore how comparative genomics studies are fundamentally shifting our understanding of the evolutionary process and it will highlight the development of new analytical methods.  The goal is to bring together researchers who share the common tools of molecular evolution but who would normally never overlap at a professional meeting. Previous Gordon Research Conferences in molecular evolution have been highly successful because they brought together diverse scientists who are nevertheless united by a common intellectual theme. The proposed program is designed to continue this successful focus on multidisciplinary approaches to cutting edge topics.",
