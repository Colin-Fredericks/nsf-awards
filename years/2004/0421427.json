 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Kansas State University under the direction of Dr. Karen A. Garrett for partial support of acquisition of equipment to enhance gene expression analysis capacity.  Understanding complex biological processes requires analysis of the expression of the thousands of genes involved.  This high-throughput gene expression profiling is now feasible through microarray technology.  Over 40 laboratories at KSU include gene expression studies as part of their research and education programs.  In response to the needs of KSU researchers, this grant will add three pieces of equipment to the KSU Gene Expression Facility to expand gene expression profiling capabilities.  1) A gene array analysis system that allows KSU researchers working with cells or tissues derived from model organisms to make use of high quality commercial arrays.   2) A ChipWriter/Colony Picking System that provides state-of-the-art gene array preparation technology and enables KSU researchers working with species that require custom arrays with subsets of genes, to print their own arrays from clones.  3) A hybridization station that will provide greater control over the critical hybridization step to reduce variability between samples and thus increase the statistical power of experiments.\r\n\r\nProjects at KSU that require this new equipment include several of which are part of the NSF-supported Kansas Ecological Genomics initiative.  This unique initiative has drawn together scientists from ecological and molecular disciplines to apply functional genomic approaches to the study of organismal response to global environmental change. Other areas of research that will especially benefit from this technology include plant and animal biology with a focus on host-parasite/pathogen interactions and research with emphases on tissue development, hormonal and drug effects, mutations, and cancer.  KSU has and is further developing strong bioinformatics support for the analysis of gene expression data.  Acquisition of this equipment will broaden the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral scientists, strengthen this research area at KSU, help to attract and recruit excellent faculty and students, and provide an additional attraction for the recruitment of the best women and minorities at all levels.  \r\n\r\nWorkshops to educate users of the equipment will be taught regularly.  The PIs and other researchers involved in this project are active participants in programs aimed toward the recruitment of women and minorities to the sciences, including NSF GROW (Girls Researching our World), NSF ADVANCE Institutional Transformation program, K-BRIN (Kansas Biomedical Research Infrastructure Network), SUROP (Summer Research Opportunities for Undergraduates) and K-State DSP (Developing Scholars Program).  In addition to the support this new equipment will provide to basic research, it will also support research contributions to the improvement of agricultural systems, human health, and ecosystem management.\r\n",
