Funding is recommended.\r\n\r\nAnalysis (rationale for decision):\r\n\r\nTravel grant awards will be provided to U.S. speakers, authors of papers, and young academics participating in the International Conference on Advanced Membrane Technology (II), to be held in Irsee, Germany, on May 23-28, 2004.  Membrane-based technology has grown to be a major technology within the last decade.  Many of the recent developments were made in the European countries and Japan.  It is an important area for industrial competitiveness as well as collaboration.  The purpose of the Conference is to discuss the latest advancements in membrane technologies. The researchers in the membrane field have diverse background, mainly in chemical engineering, chemistry, material science, biomedical and environmental engineering.  \r\n In terms of the broader impacts, it is important to provide a needed forum through this conference to bring researchers with different backgrounds and from different countries together for disseminating and exchanging the latest scientific information. It will provide an opportunity for developing international collaboration for the U.S. participants.  The grant will provide for 15-20 partial travel grants. Travel awards will be made based on the following considerations: (1) scientific or technological merit of the peaker/participant; (2) availability of other sources of travel funding; (3) professional qualifications relative to age and position; (4) institutional and geographical distribution. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
