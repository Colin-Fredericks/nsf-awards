Relative to open-ocean cycling, however, comparatively little is\r\nknown about the overall role of these areas in the global carbon cycle (e.g. Liu et al. [2000]).\r\nOne of the major challenges confronting research in the coastal environment is its very high\r\nspatio-temporal variability mainly as a result of meso- and submesoscale processes. The integral\r\nrole of these processes for the coastal ocean carbon cycle and their impact on the net exchange\r\nof CO2 with the atmosphere are virtually unknown.\r\n\r\nWe propose to address this challenge by conducting an integrated and multi-disciplinary\r\nobservational program in Santa Monica Bay, CA. In particular, we will address the following\r\nthree goals: (i) quantify the upper ocean carbon budget of Santa Monica Bay over seasonal to\r\nannual timescales, (ii) determine the integral contribution of meso- and submesoscale processes\r\nto this budget and to the air-sea exchange of CO2, and (iii) quantify the relative roles of physical\r\nand biological processes in controlling the carbon balance within mesoscale features as well as\r\nover the entire testbed region.\r\n\r\nWe plan to address these goals with three research elements: (i) time-series observations\r\nfrom an interdisciplinary moored platform (see http://www.ioe.ucla.edu/mucla), (ii) bi-weekly\r\nshipboard based water sampling at the mooring site for shorebased analysis of water column\r\ncarbon and biogeochemical properties, and (iii) process cruises scheduled on an event basis to\r\nstudy the temporal evolution of the 3-D structure of the carbon and physical fields associated\r\nwith a mesoscale or sub-mesoscale phenomenon. Analyses of the results from these efforts will be\r\ngreatly aided by the availability of very high-resolution ocean carbon cycle hindcast simulations\r\nof the area using the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (independently funded).\r\n\r\nThe proposal's unique contribution consists of the embedding of the process studies into the\r\nframework of a multidisciplinary time-series. The proposed work builds upon the strength and\r\nexpertise of the PI and his team in the areas of modeling and data analyses, while continuing\r\nthe expansion into the observational realm to address an urgent need for critical new carbon\r\nobservations. We already have initiated work on all program elements and will be able to leverage\r\nthis proposal upon a number of existing grants and synergistic activities of other investigators at\r\nUCLA and at partner institutions.\r\n\r\nBroader impact By working toward the understanding of the net impact of meso- and sub-\r\nmesoscale processes on the upper ocean carbon cycle in the coastal environment, our proposed\r\nprogram addresses two formidable challenges that the carbon community is facing currently. The\r\nubiquitous presence of mesoscale variability poses serious problems for the design of an observing\r\nnetwork that attempts to quantify the coastal ocean sources and sinks of atmospheric CO2, such\r\nas is being planned for the North American Carbon Program. In addition, carbon-cycle modeling\r\nstudies that require long integrations, such as those associated with climate change, do not have\r\nthe computational resources to resolve all mesoscale and submesoscale processes explicitly and\r\ntherefore need to incorporate the net effect of them in a parametric form.\r\n\r\nOur proposed project will build upon many already existing educational and public outreach\r\nactivities. These include the incorporation of data as examples and homework assignments into\r\nseveral undergraduate classes as well as the undertaking of several educational cruises centered\r\naround the mooring platform. In addition, we will make use of UCLA's long tradition in oceano-\r\ngraphic teaching at primary and secondary schools. In particular, we will collaborate with the\r\nNSF funded Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence at UCLA in order to reach out to\r\nK-12 teachers and their students.\r\n",
