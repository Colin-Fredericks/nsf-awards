 "awd_abstract_narration": "One major goal of evolutionary biologists is to determine how certain characteristics of\r\norganisms can influence their rates of adaptation and subsequent pattern of evolutionary change.\r\nOne such characteristic is the overall complexity of an organism. In order to address how\r\ncomplexity influences evolutionary diversification, bacterial populations were evolved in the lab\r\neither with or without selection for the ability to make spores, which are complex structures.\r\nOne measure of complexity is how many traits are maintained by the organism, and this can be\r\nexamined by looking at the contents of the genome. Changes in genome content will be\r\nexamined in these bacterial populations to detect large changes in gene organization, including\r\nthe loss or duplication of genes. Studying these gains and losses of genetic material will have\r\nimportant implications for our understanding of the speed and mode of evolutionary adaptation\r\nin all life forms.\r\nThe results of these experiments will have important implications for our understanding of how\r\ncomplexity affects adaptive evolution and rates of evolutionary change. This information is very\r\nimportant for our view of interactions between fast-evolving pathogens and their host organisms.",
