 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research grant awarded to a multidisciplinary team aims to develop algorithmic tools and a corresponding cyberinfrastructure for the development, coordination, utilization, and dissemination of knowledge regarding the application of optimization-based inverse methods for radiation treatment planning. The PIs bring to this research cross-disciplinary proficiency in Industrial Engineering, Computer Sciences, and Radiation Oncology, building on their recent research in the areas of information technology, optimization, and treatment planning. The algorithm development is based on their newly developed methodologies including slicing approaches and the Nested Partitions framework.  Along with the development of algorithms for Radiation Treatment Planning, the PIs also plan to develop a website that will provide an infrastructure to researchers worldwide for the development, coordination, utilization, and dissemination of optimization methods in Radiation Treatment Planning research. \r\n\r\nApproximately one million new cases of cancer are reported each year in the United States, with many times that number occurring worldwide. It is reported that more than 40 percent of people diagnosed with cancer in the US will undergo treatment with radiation therapy. Given the aging population, these numbers are expected to increase rapidly in coming years. It is expected that research results developed in this project will accelerate the development and understanding of efficient and effective automated Radiation Treatment Planning methods and software, resulting in clinical treatments of significantly higher quality, thereby enhancing both the quality of life and the longevity of cancer patients treated with radiation.",
