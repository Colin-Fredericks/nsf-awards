Only 15% of all Ph.D. recipients were women, only\r\n2% were black, and only 2% were Hispanic. In an effort to improve the representation of women\r\nand minorities in computer science, as the organizing committee of the 2004 ACM SIGSOFT Con-\r\nference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE-12), we are developing a plan to help\r\nincrease the participation of faculty from institutions with a large minority and/or female student\r\nenrollment. We will target institutions that have large populations of women, African Americans or\r\nHispanics. Since the conference will take place in California, we expect to be able to attract faculty\r\nthat teach Hispanic students. Our plan is to invite faculty actively involved with the education of\r\nwomen and minorities to attend FSE-12 tutorials and conference. As part of our tutorial series,\r\nwe will provide tutorials for the selected faculty to help them in their teaching. They also will be\r\ninvited to the conference to stimlate their interests in software engineering and thus their students'\r\ninterests. To help support our effort, we request NSF funding to provide travel and registration\r\ngrants for these participants, who may not otherwise have sufficient institutional funding to attend.",
