 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned about the issues of security monitoring and ATC calculations for a multi-area large power system where an independent grid operator has limited access to the network data and measurements of individual areas.  The goal is to develop a general computational framework which can be used for any multi-area system application regardless of the data base and software requirements of individual area operators and the applications themselves. The distributed nature of the proposed approach has the advantage that it will remain valid as the system size and the number of areas increase for more complex interconnected systems.  Furthermore, it allows each area to improve its software and monitoring capabilities at its own pace without the need to coordinate this activity with the other areas in the system.  The project focuses on two applications, namely the state estimation and the ATC calculations. These applications are formulated within the proposed multi-area two level computational framework. \r\n\r\nIn addition to its technical impacts, the project is expected to have broader impacts on education, training of graduate students and mentoring of students from under-represented groups.  The project will employ two graduate students who will pursue their graduate degrees during the project.  They will be trained both technically and also via laboratory teaching assignments to become future instructors in their specialties.  They will also be involved in the development of teaching materials which will then be used in undergraduate teaching laboratory.  \r\n\r\n",
