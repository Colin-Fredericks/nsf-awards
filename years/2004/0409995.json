The meeting has, for many years, been at the center of polymer physics activities worldwide.  The 2004 meeting will have talks from an international group at the cutting edge of polymer physics activities.  Among the topics to be discussed are biopolymer dynamics, glass transition dynamics, polyelectrolytes, polymer mixtures, polymer surfaces, advanced theology, and electronic materials based on polymers.  A major goal in organizing the meeting has been to invite speakers who have not previously spoken at the meeting, in order to give the polymer physics community an opportunity to hear of some of the most important new initiatives in the field.  Of those speaking in 2004, 3/4 have not previously spoken at a Polymer Physics Gordon Conference.\r\n\r\n    The Polymer Physics Gordon Conference has a strong tradition of developing human resources by including graduate students and postdocs.  One important way in which this has happened has been the poster sessions (which drew approzimately 100 participants in 2002).  The posters allow young scientists to share their results with all the meeting participants and to get important feedback.  The 2004 Gordon Conference will build on this tradition by adding four short talks by graduate students to the main program.  This new addition will further substantiate the contribution which younger scientist make to this meeting and the important role which this meeting can play in their development.  This proposal requests $4000 to cover the conference fees of 6 additional graduate students, thereby allowing them to attend the meeting.",
