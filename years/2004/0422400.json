 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will allow the Institute of Statistics and Decision Sciences\r\n(ISDS) at Duke University to purchase equipment for a high-speed\r\ncomputing cluster which will be dedicated to support research in\r\ncomputational statistical sciences.  It will be used for five projects\r\nspecifically directed at developing statistical methodology for complex,\r\nhigh-dimensional hierarchical models using distributed computing\r\nenvironments.  Specific research problems involve sequential importance\r\nsampling in latent variable models, combinatorial search for data mining\r\napplications, adaptive stochastic search for high dimensional model\r\nspaces, multivariate nonparametric function estimation, and multivariate\r\nspatial-temporal modeling.  These problems, which are typical of\r\napplications in many scientific disciplines, require substantial\r\ncomputational power, in both speed and memory, and require development of\r\nnew methodology for efficient implementations in modern distributed\r\ncomputing environments.  \r\n\r\nModern statistical methodology has allowed researchers to propose more\r\ncomplex and realistic models for many scientific problems, however,\r\npowerful computing environments and sutiable methodology are necessary\r\nto make progress as larger datasets become available. This grant will\r\nallow the Institute of Statistics and Decision Sciences (ISDS) at Duke\r\nUniversity to purchase a high-speed computing cluster, dedicated to\r\nsupport research in computational statistical sciences. Projects\r\ninclude spatio-temporal models to integrate information at multiple\r\nlevels, with applications in climate change and ecology, new classes of\r\nmodels for identifying protein biomarkers for early cancer detection,\r\nnovel algorithms for exploring high-dimensional collections of models\r\nand combining them, new techniques for modern data mining, and efficient\r\nmethodology for sequential analysis of data collected over time.  These\r\nare all areas at the forefront of statistics with broad applicability to\r\nwidespread problems in the statistics, science and beyond.  The proposed\r\ncomputing system will be both extensible and upgradeable.  Serving\r\ninitially the five projects, it will also provide for future expansion\r\nas these projects evolve and generate new directions in collaborative\r\nresearch involving the primary investigators.  The proposed research\r\nwill have significant immediate impact on education through involvement\r\nof Ph.D.  students and postdoctoral researchers directly in the proposed\r\nresearch, and incorporation of results into graduate courses at Duke\r\nUniversity.  Results will be disseminated to the statistical and broader\r\nscientific communities via software distributed on the web, direct collaboration\r\nwith researchers in other disciplines, conference presentations, and\r\npapers to be published in academic journals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
