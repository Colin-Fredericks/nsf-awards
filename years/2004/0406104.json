 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI's research includes the use of fixed-point methods,\r\nthe method of moments, and complex-analytic singularity analysis to\r\nstudy additive functionals on random trees, which arise in the\r\nanalysis of divide-and-conquer algorithms.  It seeks to explain,\r\nusing continuum random trees and Brownian excursion or otherwise, an\r\ninvariance of distributions observed across various random-trees\r\nmodels.  A refined analysis, under the so-called random permutation\r\nmodel, of the periodic asymptotic distributional behavior of\r\nadditive functionals for trees with large branching factor also\r\nextends to urn models and multi-type branching processes.\r\nAdditionally, the research encompasses digital analyses and\r\nimprovements of algorithms for searching and sorting, such as the\r\nwidely-used Quicksort; use of a perfect simulation algorithm\r\npioneered by the PI to estimate mixing times of Markov chains\r\nstatistically; and the novel application of Mellin transforms to the\r\nstudy of small deviations (small-ball probabilities) for Gaussian\r\nrandom fields.\r\n\r\nThe research to be performed lies at the interface of probability\r\nand computer science.  It involves the design and application of\r\nefficient algorithms for computer simulation from complicated\r\nprobability distributions; the probabilistic analysis of algorithms\r\nand data structures arising in connection with such basic and\r\nimportant algorithms as Quicksort, which is the standard sorting\r\nprocedure in Unix systems and which, in a computer science review\r\npaper in 2000, was cited as one of the ten algorithms with the\r\ngreatest influence on the development and practice of science and\r\nengineering in the last century; and the novel application of a\r\ncommon analysis-of-algorithms tool (\"Mellin transforms\") to an area\r\nof probability (\"small deviations\", involving the estimation of the\r\nchance of certain uncommon events).\r\n",
