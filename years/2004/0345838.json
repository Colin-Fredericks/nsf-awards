Plants of this time occur after the biotic recovery from the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction events, yet shortly before the major climate changes of the Paleocene/Eocene transition. The Late Paleocene Almont and Beicegel Creek floras from North Dakota provide an unparalleled opportunity to study the changing flora that occurred at this time and to expand the documentation of rarer Paleocene elements, especially the emergence of mostly temperate families (Ranunculaceae, the buttercup family) and genera [Cornus, (the dogwoods) and Acer (maples)].  Because these unusually preserved floras document both internal anatomy and external surface features of fossil plant remains, they can serve as a benchmark with which to compare two   disparate types of fossils of the same age: European seed and fruit assemblages and leaf compression floras of western North America and Asia.  The funded research will provide invaluable information useful for other studies focusing on the evolutionary history of temperate families (Actinidiaceae, Betulaceae, Ranunculaceae) and the biogeographic history and development of North American and Asian floras.\r\n\r\nThis project will provide an excellent opportunity for outreach.  First graduate and undergraduate students, including women and underrepresented groups will be trained in paleobiology.  Second, there are a number of other avenues for outreach including incorporation of information in formal courses ranging from introductory environmental science to community ecology and plant anatomy, public lectures in museums, and activities for K-12 schools (through GC&SU's Academic Outreach Program).  Finally, an exhibit on the Almont Flora will be established for GC&SU's new museum showcasing the research of the Department of Biology and Environmental Sciences five faculty members who work with Cenozoic floras and faunas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
