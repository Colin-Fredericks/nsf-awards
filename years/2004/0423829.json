 "awd_abstract_narration": "An international conference on Nitride Semiconductors will be held July 19-23, 2004 in Pittsburgh, PA. The conference is organized to include discussion of Epitaxial Growth (MOVPE, MBE, CBE, VPE, alternative precursors, regrowth, new alloys); Substrates (lateral epitaxial growth, bulk crystals, SiC, thick GaN layers, oxides, new materials); Defects and Doping (defect structures and their characterisation, new dopants); Interface Physics (electronic surface and interface states, interface polarization charges, adsorption and surface reaction); Optical Characterization (exciton physics, optical surface spectroscopy (ellipsometry, RAS, PL, CL)); Electrical Characterization (carrier transport, magneto-transport, photo-conductivity, CV techniques); Quantum structures (fabrication of low dimensional structures and their optical and/or electrical Properties); Processing (etching (dry, wet), cleaving, high reflection coatings, passivation, ohmic and Schottky Contacts); and device ramifications. The format includes oral and poster sessions. The conference is expected to stimulate collaboration and discussion between researchers, especially between young professionals and established experts and to identify critical scientific issues.\r\n%%%\r\nAn evaluation of the progress and status of fundamental phenomena involved in the growth and processing of gallium nitride is an important and timely topic, and will be of great value to progress in the electronics/photonics field. Along with the opportunity to assess the field and future directions, it is expected that new ties will be established among universities, research institutions, and industry. The requested NSF funds will be used to facilitate participation in the meeting by students. \r\n***\r\n",
