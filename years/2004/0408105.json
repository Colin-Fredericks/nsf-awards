 "awd_abstract_narration": "The alpine biome is the only terrestrial ecosystem that is distributed globally.  Understanding genetic variation and evolution of plant species in these widespread yet isolated ecosystems will provide insight into the origins of global biodiversity.  The plant genus Oreomyrrhis is found in alpine and sub-Antarctic environments around the South Pacific Rim, a unique distribution well suited for studying the evolution of alpine plants.  This grant will support travel to Central America to complete worldwide sampling of Oreomyrrhis species.  By applying molecular genetic approaches, interspecific relationships will be reconstructed to elucidate histories and mechanisms underlying Oreomyrrhis's distribution.  Dr. Barbara Schaal and Kuo-fang Chung will also compare population genetic structures of Oreomyrrhis species in Ecuador, Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, and the sub-Antarctic islands of Tierra del Fuego and Falkland Islands, illuminating evolutionary forces that have shaped genetic variation of alpine life.\r\n\r\nTo survive harsh alpine environments, organisms evolve distinctive adaptations that characterize the alpine ecosystems.  However, this unique ecosystem is now diminishing rapidly as global warming triggers an upward migration of mountain vegetation belts, narrowing alpine zones to higher and more arid environments.  Results of this study will provide data to evaluate and predict the impacts of global warming on alpine plant communities, information necessary for designing effective polices to conserve the intriguing and fragile alpine biodiversity.\r\n",
