 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a growing interest in developing technologies which use silicon and other electronic materials as mechanical materials.  Using standard processes of the integrated circuit industry, researchers have successfully fabricated miniature mechanical components, or micromachines.  The integration of miniaturized mechanical components with microelectronic components has spawned a new technology, known as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).  It promises to extend the benefits of microelectronic fabrication to sensing and actuating functions.  However, given the dimensions of micromachines, surface phenomena such as adhesion, friction, and wear are principal source of yield and reliability concerns plaguing MEMS industry. These issues will persist, indeed escalate, as microsystems technologies begin to transition into the nanoscale. Recent research by us and others has successfully addressed the issue of adhesion (often termed stiction in this context). The present proposal aims to understand and overcome the problem of wear in MEMS.  The proposed research is expected to result in wear-resistant processes that are compatible with the release-antistiction technology we have recently developed, to achieve the ultimate goal of robust, manufacturable, low cost MEMS devices. \r\n\r\nThe impact of achieving anti-stiction, self-lubricating, wear resistant coatings in MEMS is manifold.  (i) Economically, it would lead to increased lifetime, and reliability of manufactured microparts and micromachines; (ii) From the manufacturing point of view, it would lead to simplified design of micromachines with moving parts; (iii) It would also have an environmental impact via the elimination of liquid lubricants. (iv) The project will provide core training for a graduate student.  \r\n",
