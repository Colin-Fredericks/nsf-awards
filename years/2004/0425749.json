 "awd_abstract_narration": "Redox homeostasis is central to the functions of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms\r\nsuch as cyanobacteria and plants. In this project, a systems approach will be\r\nundertaken to analyze the impact of cellular redox status on the overall functions of\r\nthese organisms. The initial focus will be on the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803,\r\nwith subsequent applications in the understanding of the biology of Arabidopsis, a\r\nvascular plant, and Physcomitrella, a non-vascular plant. Synechocystis 6803 has a\r\ncompletely sequenced genome and is amenable to high-throughput genome level\r\nmanipulations. Although the detailed inventory of the genes, transcripts and proteins are\r\navailable for Synechocystis, it is inadequate to comprehend the organizational hierarchy\r\nof the complex functions of this organism. A multidisciplinary approach will be used to\r\nresolve this gap in fundamental knowledge. The expertise of the project team spans\r\nmolecular genetics, biochemistry, proteomics, metabolomics, computational biology and\r\nsystems engineering, which includes nonlinear modeling, estimation and statistical\r\nanalysis. The experimental research experience of the team spans model systems in\r\ncyanobacteria, moss and flowering plants. One aim is to infer a gene regulatory network\r\nin cyanobacteria that will include identification of the sensing and signaling pathways. In\r\naddition, a gene regulatory network will be independently generated in Arabidopsis, and\r\nthe conservation of the genes and interactions will be evaluated. The network will be\r\nvalidated, the contribution of the network modules to the overall redox regulation will be\r\nstudied, and the model will be extended to Physcomitrella. Such an iterative process is\r\nexpected to generate fundamental insights into the organization and function of the\r\nredox control network (RCN) in these organisms. Furthermore, the proposed approach,\r\nviz. first to model an RCN in cyanobacteria and then to extend it to plants, will highlight\r\nthe expected conserved nature of these processes during the evolution of land plants.\r\n\r\nBroad Impact: The research activities in this project will be intimately connected to the\r\ntraining and development of undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students, and\r\nvisiting scholars, both at Washington University and Colgate University. In particular,\r\nstudents from both Biology and Systems Engineering will become well-versed in the use\r\nof mathematics and computational methods to answer challenging questions in biology.\r\nCollaborative interactions with Saitama University will allow scientific interactions and\r\nresearch visits between USA and Japan. An important goal of this project is an\r\nintegration of cutting-edge technologies with learning experiences that will inspire faculty\r\nand student development from small colleges lacking significant research programs.\r\nThe students will obtain mentoring, research credit and training. They will become\r\naware of the fascinating array of activities and career choices in modern life science\r\nresearch. Hands-on training in genomics, bioinformatics and systems science research\r\nwill have far-reaching educational impacts well beyond the project period.\r\nThe link for the project web site is http://www.sysbio.wustl.edu/.",
