Few sites have the capacity to copy an entire data set to local storage prior to analysis or visualization.  In-stead, this work explores distributed access strategies to enable remote applications to query and receive on-demand delivery of relevant fragments of large data sets.  Integrated into a data grid that manages distributed data collections, these strategies monitor appli-cation access patterns and pre-fetch and cache needed portions of a data set, delivering to the remote application only the data that is needed, as it is needed.  The approach is simi-lar to virtual memory paging systems found in operating systems, but uses knowledge of the spatial and temporal structure of data sets and the application's observed access pat-terns to efficiently pre-fetch, format, cache, and deliver the data.  The results of this work enable distributed access to data sets far larger than local storage resources would other-wise allow.  Network bandwidth is used more efficiently by transferring only the data that is needed, and local storage is used only as a cache for frequently used portions of a data set.  Expected results of this work include predictive pre-fetch algorithms, cost mod-els, and a prototype implementation whose usefulness will be validated by its application to several real-world problems involving distributed access to enormous data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Brett D.
