 "awd_abstract_narration": "The engineering program at The University of Alabama is experiencing an attrition rate of approximately 67 percent.  This is higher than the national average of 52 percent for similar programs.  Ten years of performance data indicates this is due to two major barriers: deficiencies in the student's mathematical ability and student's lack of motivation.  Approximately 50 percent of entering freshman engineering students need one or two semesters of Algebra, Algebra II, Geometry, and Trigonometry (the focus areas of this program) to be considered calculus ready.  To overcome these barriers, a five-week summer residence Engineering Math Advancement Program (E-MAP) is being conducted which provides 160 graduate high school/pre-freshman students with the necessary background to be engineering calculus ready.  The program improves students' retention of mathematics skills learned prior to entering college and eliminates the delay caused by the one or two semesters of mathematics that would normally be required to advance their ability to the level of engineering calculus.  In addition to improving their mathematics skills, E-MAP is coupled with a \"hands-on\" laboratory to bolster students' enthusiasm for engineering.  Participating students are being exposed to exciting career choices available in engineering through direct field experience with practicing engineers.",
