This is a very strong nomination; the panelists indicated that it targets well what a mentoring program should be.  Notably, 25% of participants are women of color. WEP has identified barriers to women in academic engineering programs and strategies/methods to overcome them.  Women in engineering are retained at a high rate (60-70% at the end of sophomore year).  WEP provides mentors for women early in their collegiate experience. It is a program with a variety of activities, and involves one-on-one mentoring and team leadership activities.  WEP has a good success rate with proven results and is supported by the University.  Other programs on campus are using the WEP orientation component as a model and other universities are adapting the overall WEP as a model.",
