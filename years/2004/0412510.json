 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators propose a mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative)\r\nstudy of distributed content leadership in middle school mathematics.\r\nThere is little research on what content, pedagogical, and diagnostic\r\nknowledge leaders must have to effectively assist teachers in\r\nimplementing demands of rigorous mathematics instruction and student\r\nlearning.  This research builds on prior research of the investigators\r\nwho examined distributed leadership at the elementary school level.\r\nHowever, this research will go much deeper into defining and\r\nunderstanding the leaders and the roles they play.\r\n \r\n\r\nMuch of the project is devoted to developing instruments to measure\r\nmathematics content leadership as distributed in middle schools.\r\nSpecifically, the team proposes to develop, test, and validate\r\nmeasurement instruments of content leadership practice and knowledge and\r\nto examine how content leadership affects how teachers teach.  They also\r\npropose to test whether content leadership can be learned.  All of this\r\nwork will be conducted in the context of a Mathematics and Science\r\nPartnership (MSP) Teacher Institute for the 21sth Century site.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe proposed program of work fills a major gap in the knowledge base by\r\ngenerating new information and evidence about content leadership\r\nknowledge and practices as they relate to improvement in mathematics\r\neducation. The senior research team brings together experienced scholars\r\nand teachers from mathematics, mathematics education, teacher learning,\r\nleadership, policy, and statistics.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe research is divided into two main parts.  The first will focus on\r\nthe development, piloting, and validation of instrumentation for\r\nidentifying and documenting content area leadership practice for middle\r\nschool mathematics.  The second part will study the nature (i.e., the\r\nwhat, the how and the why) of content area leadership practice for\r\nmiddle school mathematics and its relations to (a) leadership\r\ndevelopment and (b) classroom teachers and teaching.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis work may have significant broad impact by generating usable\r\nknowledge and methodological tools that will be of considerable interest\r\nto MSPs and Institute Partnerships and to the school systems around the\r\nnation.  By focusing on content leadership in urban schools, this work\r\nwill contribute to improving mathematics education for urban youth, who\r\nhave historically been underserved by many school systems.\r\n\r\n",
