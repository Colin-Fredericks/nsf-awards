 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a sustainable alternative to fiberglass load-bearing multi-purpose panels with novel cellular nano-biocomposites. Cellular nano-biocomposites. The cellular nano-biocomposite will be used to develop advanced panel components for multiple-use (i.e., housing floors, walls, roofs, bridge decks, RV panels) with tailorable integrated multi-functions (i.e., stiffness, strength, toughness, thermal insulation, fire protection, and user friendliness). \r\nThe research objectives will be achieved through a fundamental study guided by four general tasks:\r\nI.\tBiobased Polyester Resin. Suitable biobased resin from a blend of petroleum-based polyester and functionalized soybean oil (~ 30 wt.%) is proposed to address both engineering and environmental requirements. \r\nII.\t Clay/Biobased Polyester Nanocomposite. The properties of biobased resin will be enhanced with nanoclay reinforcement dispersed via exfoliation. \r\nIII.\t Nano-reinforced Polyester Biocomposite. The polymer nanocomposite will be additionally reinforced with \"engineered\" natural fibers. \r\nIV.\t Cellular Structural Material and Panel Systems. The specific properties of the nano-reinforced biocomposite will be further enhanced through the topological design of the material in cellular arrangements. \r\n\r\nThe project is a multidisciplinary effort among the Departments of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, and Agriculture Economics. The research approach integrates the technical components of analysis, design and manufacturing with broad societal impact elements such as environment, economy, life-cycle analysis, energy, industrial collaboration, education integration, and outreach.\r\nThe project will allow education and research training of two graduate and two undergraduatestudents. Research and education will be integrated in advanced composite materials courses across departments and through multidisciplinary student activities. A determined attempt will be made to recruit underrepresented students using university programs. We expect to create a break-through concept for a new generation of high-performance load-bearing components through fundamental research. The research will add considerable knowledge in the engineering of naturally reinforced nanocomposites, innovative structural design, and will create consciousness in designing value-added, eco-friendly and affordable materials and components for the 21-st century.\r\n",
