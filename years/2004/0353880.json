 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Mathematics will host the summer program Mathematics and Computing Research Experiences for Undergraduates at Iowa State University.  Participants will spend eight weeks working on research projects as part of active research groups at ISU.  The projects are in a variety of mathematical areas, representing the diverse research interests of the ISU Mathematics Department, but all utilize computational methods; current projects are described in more detail on the website www.math.iastate.edu/reu/.  In addition to carrying out their own research, students will attend a weekly REU Seminar, where they will hear faculty lectures on a variety of mathematical topics and presentations related to attending graduate school.  The REU will conclude with a symposium of student reports. Participants will be provided a stipend, accommodation in University student housing, and some travel and meal expenses, and will have the opportunity to participate in social activities for REU students.\r\n\r\nEach year twelve students will be selected from the national pool of talented undergraduates.  Women and minorities are particularly encouraged to apply and this REU will run concurrently with the ISU Program for Women in Science and Engineering summer internship program and the Alliance program, in which students from historically black colleges come to the ISU Mathematics Department.\r\n",
