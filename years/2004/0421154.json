 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will acquire a facility for state-of-the-art small/wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) instrumentation for research, research training, and integrated research/education activities at the University at Buffalo (UB), The State University of New York (SUNY).  The SAXS/WAXS instrument probes\r\ndifferences in electron density within a sample.  Analysis of the data obtained provides structural details at length scales ranging from 0.2 to 100 nanometers.  Examples of information to be obtained from SAXS/WAXS are (i) size and shape of polymers, proteins, and nanoparticles in solution, (ii) non-uniform (two-phase) structure of materials, and (iii) crystalline periodic structure of surfactants, polymers or nanocomposites.  The SAXS/WAXS instrument will support high quality scientific research in nanostructured materials and\r\nrelated topics, which will result in important advances in the fundamental understanding of several methods of synthesis of nanoparticles and nanostructured materials and in the self-assembly of such nanoscopic building blocks.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the proposed work will be of two types:  (a) societal impacts and improvements in quality of life due to long-term implementation of the science and technology developed in commercial applications; and (b) education and outreach impacts.  In education and outreach, the proposed instrument will be used by numerous graduate students in their thesis research, as well as by undergraduate researchers.  The instrument will also be used in formal science and engineering courses.  Faculty involved in this proposal will continue their outreach efforts to underrepresented minority students at the high-school, undergraduate, and graduate levels.  Finally, this facility will be made available to local industry, thus fostering intellectual connections between industry and academia and contributing to the local\r\neconomy.\r\n",
