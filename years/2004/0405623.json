 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves problems in geometric group theory and spaces of non-positive curvature with a focus on Artin groups \r\nand Garside groups.   Artin groups span a wide range of groups including braid groups, free groups, and free abelian groups. \r\nThe first part of the project concerns automorphism groups of right-angled Artin groups. These are finitely generated groups \r\nwhose presentations involve only commutator relations between generators. By varying the number of commutator relations, \r\nright-angled Artin groups may be viewed as \"interpolating\" between free groups and free abelian groups. The automorphism \r\ngroups of free groups have been the focus of much research in recent years. They have been shown to have much in common \r\nwith linear groups, in particular with the automorphism groups of free abelian groups.  This project aims to put these \r\nresults in a broader context by studying the automorphism group of a general right-angled Artin group. The key idea is to \r\nconstruct a contractible space, analogous to Culler and Vogtmann's \"outer space\", on which the automorphism group acts.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the project concerns Garside groups. Garside groups are groups with algorithmic properties similar to \r\nthose of braid groups. A Garside structure on a group gives a very powerful tool for studying the combinatorial and geometric \r\nproperties of the group. This approach has been used extensively in the study of finite type Artin groups. While no such \r\nstructure exists for infinite type Artin groups, it appears that something close to a Garside structure may exist for at \r\nleast some of these groups. The project will consider various generalizations of Garside groups and their properties.\r\n\r\nSymmetries of geometric objects have been studied since ancient times and have played an important role in many areas of \r\nmathematics and the sciences. They form the model for the abstract mathematical notion of a \"group\". Groups arise in nearly \r\nevery field of mathematics. While not all groups occur naturally as symmetry groups, it is always possible to construct\r\ngeometric objects on which a given group acts as symmetries. In recent years, this interplay between groups and geometry \r\nhas been increasingly exploited to understand various types of infinite groups. A particularly interesting class of groups \r\nthat lends itself to such techniques are the \"braid groups\".  The n-strand braid group, as the name suggests, encodes the \r\ndifferent ways that a set of n strings can be braided.  It also describes the different ways that a collection of n particles\r\n can move around in a plane. Braid groups have applications to topology, mathematical physics, and cryptography.  \r\nAnother fundamental class of groups are the \"free groups\". These groups form the foundation for studying algorithmic and \r\ncombinatorial properties of groups in general. In this project we will study a large class of groups, known as Artin groups, \r\nthat includes the braid groups, the free groups, and many others.  The project aims to reach a better understanding of Artin \r\ngroups by studying geometric objects associated with them, as well as searching for new algorithmic techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
