 "awd_abstract_narration": "I propose to use methods from algebraic topology in the study of knots.  A \r\nknot induces a map from the space of configurations on the knot to \r\nconfigurations in the ambient manifold.  With recently developed \r\ncompactification technology, one can fix boundary conditions on those \r\nconfiguration spaces and study the homotopy class of this induced map \r\nrelative to those boundary conditions.  Such an approach was pioneered \r\nby Bott and Taubes in de Rham theory and by the PI and his collaborators \r\nin homotopy theory itself.  Results of Volic may be used to show that all \r\nBott-Taubes invariants, and thus all real finite-type invariants, are \r\nhomotopy invariants of this induced map.  Already in lowest degree, new \r\ngeometric understanding arises from studying the induced map directly \r\nhomotopy, and I propose to continue this study in higher degrees.  I \r\nalso propose to more deeply understand the role of operads in this theory, \r\nas well as to extend these techniques to study link homotopy.\r\n\r\nKnot theory, the study of embedded loops in space, is one of the oldest \r\nand most distinguished fields in topology.  For most of its life, knot \r\ntheory has developed in parallel with other subfields of topology.  But \r\nin the last twenty years, the field has changed dramatically from the \r\ninfluence of previously unrelated fields.  In particular, quantum field \r\ntheory has provided ground-breaking new constructions.  One can try to \r\ndefine the energy of a knot as an invariant, but in order to do so one \r\nmust \"integrate over all connections\", that is over all ways of putting \r\nan \"energy field\" on the space in which the knot lives.  Such an integral \r\ndoes not exist in precise mathematical form, but through the standard \r\nperturbative expansion in quantum field theory one can write down \r\nFeynman integrals which are meant to approximate  it to finite order.  \r\nTopologists have made such integrals precise and rigorous in this \r\nsetting, and shown that they provide a basis for the finite-type \r\ninvariants of knots.  But topologists would like to reconnect the \r\ntheory to more standard constructions in topology.  The PI's previous \r\nwork marks the beginning of such a connection.  New geometric insight \r\nwas gained in the process, as the simplest quantum invariant can now be \r\ncomputed by counting instances of a line intersecting a knot in exactly \r\nfour places.   I hope to find both new connections with classical \r\ntopology and novel geometric interpretations in this proposed work. \r\n",
