 "awd_abstract_narration": "The pioneering works of Bennequin and Eliashberg from the 1980s and \r\nthe 1990s have shown that, among all contact structures, the tight \r\nones best reflect the topology of the ambient space. Only in the past \r\ndecade have sufficient tools been developed to allow many of the \r\nbasic classification questions in the subject to be attacked. The PI \r\nproposes joint work with Honda and Mati\\'c to analyze the contact \r\ntopology of Haken manifolds using cut-and-paste techniques. Important \r\noutgrowths of this investigation include constructions of tight \r\ncontact structures in Haken homology spheres, extensions of the \r\nrelationship with foliation theory to laminations and hyperbolic \r\nmanifolds, and an understanding of the interplay between the \r\nsubsurface complex and contact structures on a product.\r\n\r\nThree-dimensional manifolds are modeled on the three-dimensional \r\nspace we live in.  Contact and symplectic topology were originally \r\nmotivated by questions of physicists working in classical mechanics \r\nand thermodynamics. They arise in a surprisingly broad array of \r\napplied situations ranging from fluid flows to the manufacture of \r\nprojection screen televisions. The proposed research has the \r\npotential to produce new results applicable to these fields.\r\n",
