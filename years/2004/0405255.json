The first one is about\r\nthe Ricci flow on manifolds with positive isotropic curvature. We want\r\nto work out a classification of closed 4-manifolds with positive\r\nisotropic curvature. The second one is about the Ricci flow on\r\ncohomogeneity one manifolds. One question is to explore when\r\nnonnegativity of sectional curvature is preserved and when the\r\nsectional curvature becomes positive. Another question is to explore\r\nwhen Hamilton and Ivey's pinching theorem will hold. The third one is\r\nabout the relation between the Ricci flow and quantum field theory;\r\nespecially we will focus on the duality property of the Ricci flow\r\nwith symmetry. We will look for mathematical applications of new ideas\r\nin physics which are related to the Ricci flow.\r\n\r\n    The Ricci flow is a very important mathematical field and has the\r\npotential to solve very challenging problems relating to the geometric and\r\ntopological properties of spaces of dimensions three and four.\r\nRecently the fundamental work of Perelman has drawn a lot of attention\r\nto the field. The Ricci flow has a close connection with string\r\ntheory;  more precisely, Ricci flow is the first order approximation of\r\nthe so-called renormalization group flow (RG flow). The proposed study\r\nwill improve our understanding of the Ricci flow and demonstrate that\r\nRiemannian Ricci flow is a powerful tool in studying\r\ngeometric-topological properties of manifolds of dimension greater\r\nthan three. Furthermore we hope the proposed study will improve our\r\nunderstanding of the RG flow in string theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
