 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support to continue research on the high intensity K-short/neutral-hyperon data of NA48/1 (CERN), to participate in the CLEO-c (CESR) program, and to commence involvement with the MECO (BNL) experiment.  NA48/1 is a search for rare K-short and neutral hyperon decays with a single-event sensitivity of about 3 x10-10. Its primary objectives include measurements of K0S to p0e(m)+e(m)- and cascade hyperon semi-leptonic and weak radiative decays. CLEO-c expects to collect data at the Psi'' resonance, at a center-of-mass energy of 4140 MeV (above the DsDs threshold) and at the J/Psi , yielding samples of 1.5 million DsDs pairs, 30 million DD pairs, and one billion J/Psi. These data will provide a typical sensitivity, for rare D decay searches, of 2-3 orders of magnitude better than Particle Data Group values. The PI intends to investigate flavor-changing neutral-current decays of the D-meson and weak radiative decays of the Lc.  CLEO-c formally commenced in Summer 2003 and the investigator will work with the software coordinator on special support tasks.  MECO intends to set a limit of  < 10-16 on the branching ratio for muon to electron conversion with a newly designed detector and innovative method for producing a high purity, momentum- and charge-selected muon beam.  MECO aims to take data during the second half of this decade, and the PI would likely collaborate with colleagues at the College of William & Mary on the construction of the cosmic muon veto system.\r\n\r\nThe PI will continue his efforts to recruit underrepresented populations into the mathematical sciences and he will join an ongoing effort to develop teacher training programs for science and mathematics pedagogy at all grade-school levels. \r\n",
