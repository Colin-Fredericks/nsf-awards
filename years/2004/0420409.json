 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program, the Department of Chemistry and Physics at SUNY College at Old Westbury will acquire a 300 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) Spectrometer. This equipment will enable researchers to carry out studies on a) androgen and glucocorticoid receptor ligands; b) synthetic analogs of metalloproteins possessing Lewis acid metallo-cysteinate centers; c) solid state NMR studies on water dynamics in metal-containing biological crystals; and d) analysis of chemical constituents in over-the-counter nutraceuticals .   \r\n\r\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic chemistry and biochemistry. \r\n",
