The workshop is being co-organized by the PI and by Jan Persens from the University of the Western Cape, South Africa. A number of leading American researchers in computer security have identified current research issues in information security, information exchange, and information hiding, and will work towards developing collaborative approaches to solving these problems. Computer security issues, in this era when more and more information is developed and maintained in electronic form, have vastly increased in importance, and in order to develop stronger methods, more scholars need to become interested in this field. This research workshop will develop collaborations among the American practitioners in the field, as well as among US researchers and the African scholars who will participate in the workshop.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this project will be to deepen and sustain the relationship between US and African mathematicians and computer scientists. A significant number of the US participants are from minority-serving institutions, so it is expected that this activity will bring a broader range of US participants to this field of research.\r\n",
