 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis research project will apply microeconomics, in particular game theory, to the analysis of\r\nqueuing and scheduling protocols.  Previous work on this problem has focused on the non\r\ncooperative behavior of participants - in particular the decision to join a queue\r\nor \"balk\"-, and the incentives to reveal one's waiting cost. It relies on cash\r\ntransfers to align incentives with effciency.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is twofold. Firstly it focuses on\r\nfairness and cooperative stability, in particular the ideas of limited liability and\r\nthe strategic tranfers of jobs. Secondly it develops a probabilistic model of\r\nscheduling,where cash transfers are ruled out and the server randomly orders\r\nthe different jobs according to their processing times and release dates. It is\r\ncontrasted with the more familiar quasi-linear model, where cash transfers are\r\nfeasible and disutilities are linear in waiting time until job completion.\r\n\r\nOn the fairness side a first concern is to limit a user's liability to wait, i.e.,\r\nto place as tight a cap as possible on his worst case delay, given his own characteristics\r\nand the number of potential other users. The PI will develop a probabilistic model and will analyze different scheduling methods to determine which method best achieves social goals.\r\n\r\nWhen the central processor cannot monitor easily the identity of the final consumers of\r\nthe jobs it processes, customers can merge their jobs into a single job, use straw men\r\nto split a single job into several small jobs, or transfer parts of their jobs within\r\na coalition. The scheduling methods for which these cooperative maneuvers\r\nare never profitable will be systematically investigated.\r\n\r\nQueuing and scheduling are central to\r\nthe production of manufactured commodities, to the exploitation of congested\r\ncommons such as road networks and the Internet, and much more. The models that will be developed and analyzed encompass all these examples, and other simple scheduling protocols\r\nwith universal applicability. In the internet and many other congested\r\nnetworks, cash transfers are not feasible, and randomization is the only way to\r\nachieve fairness, typically by serving first a short job with a higher probability\r\nthan a long job. The simple shortest job first protocol fails to protect short jobs\r\nfrom being \"starved\" by longer jobs. This research provides systematic solutions\r\nto this problem, to the related disruption of job transfers accross users,\r\nand to several other normative concerns.\r\n1",
