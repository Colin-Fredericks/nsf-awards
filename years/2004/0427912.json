 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for Collaboration \r\n0427985, 0427464, 0427094,0427912,0427695 \r\n\r\nA multidisciplinary team of researchers from Argonne National \r\nLaboratory, Carnegie Mellon University, Columbia University, \r\nUniversity of Chicago, Emory University, and University of \r\nPennsylvania, with collaborators from the Universities of Graz and \r\nLubek, will initiate a long term research project on image-driven, \r\ninversion-based biophysical modeling. The team includes expertise in \r\nnumerical algorithms and scientific computing, fluid and solid \r\nbiomechanics, PDE optimization, inverse problems, medical image \r\nanalysis and processing, and distributed and grid computing necessary \r\nto tackle this class of problems. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to create a framework for assimilating multimodal \r\ndynamic medical image data to produce highly-resolved, \r\nphysically-realistic, patient-specific biomechanics models. While the \r\ncomputational and algorithmic aspects of the project are widely \r\napplicable, the target application will be the construction of \r\npatient-specific cardiac biomechanics models from 4D image datasets of \r\nheart motion. Such models are useful for medical diagnosis and \r\nsurgical planning. This places a premium on quick turnaround of the \r\ncomputations, which mean they must be fast, scalable, and capable of \r\nexploiting grid-based computing. \r\n\r\nResearch will focus on three key areas that undergird the project's \r\noverall goals: registration, inversion, and distributed computing. The \r\nregistration research component will create multilevel algorithms to \r\nextract cardiac deformation histories from time-varying medical image \r\ndatasets via the solution of sequences of 3D image registration \r\nproblems. The inversion research component will develop multilevel \r\nalgorithms that use these deformation field histories as virtual \r\nobservations to solve inverse problems for cardiac biomechanical \r\nparameters. The distributed computing research component will create \r\ntools for performance prediction and resource scheduling that support \r\nsimulations across distributed computational resources. \r\n\r\nDovetailing with the research components, the project will undertake \r\nan educational program designed to communicate the fruits of its work \r\nand of the wider benefits of the integration of the biomedical \r\nsciences, computing sciences, and computational sciences, to a more \r\ngeneral audience of students, disciplinary researchers, and the lay \r\npublic. The professional activities of the team members in the \r\ninversion, image registration, grid computing, and computational \r\nscience communities will be parlayed to organize workshops and \r\ninternational meetings, edit volumes, teach summer schools, develop \r\nuniversity and short courses, and engage in outreach activities---as \r\nthey have done in the past---but with greater emphasis on the field of \r\ncomputational biomedicine. The proposed image-based cardiac \r\nbiomechanics modeling application will provide an excellent \r\nopportunity to demonstrate the benefits to health and welfare that \r\nadvances in optimization-based registration and inversion algorithms \r\nand Grid computing can provide. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
