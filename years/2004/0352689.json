 "awd_abstract_narration": "With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Allan Simmons will conduct two seasons of archaeological  investigation into the initial colonization of the Mediterranean island of \r\nCyprus,.  For many years, scholars considered the Mediterranean islands as \r\nlate recipients of human occupation. Cyprus, however, had the earliest \r\nevidence, with most data pointing to the founding of the first villages during \r\nthe later Neolithic period, around 6,000 B.C. The Neolithic, the transition \r\nfrom hunting and gathering economies to those based on food production, first \r\noccurred on the Near Eastern mainland about 9,000 B.C. and thus the colonization \r\nof the Mediterranean islands was seen as relatively late.  Furthermore, the \r\nisland Neolithic was characterized as a nondescript counterpart of its \r\nmainland ancestors, often regarded as little more than a footnote in the wider \r\nNeolithic world.  Research at Ais Yiorkis challenges this perception.\r\n\r\nRecent discoveries on Cyprus demonstrated an initial occupation around \r\n10,000 B.C., which likely resulted in the extinction of native Pleistocene \r\nfauna such as the pygmy hippopotamus.  Other research has extended the \r\nchronology and scope of the actual Neolithic colonization of the island by \r\nabout 1,000 years.  This newly defined phase, the Cypro-PPNB, presently \r\nconsists of a handful of sites, of which Ais Yiorkis is one.  Research at the \r\nsettlement is oriented towards understanding why it is atypical from other \r\nNeolithic sites.  First, it is located in the uplands rather the coastal area, \r\nwhere nearly all other sites are situated.  Second, it contains a \r\ntechnologically and typologically sophisticated artifact assemblage, including \r\nimported obsidian artifacts.  Third, although it does not appear to be a \r\nvillage, it contains a large circular stone structure unlike anything \r\npreviously found in the Cypriot Neolithic.  Finally, economic data suggest a \r\nfar more wide ranging subsistence base that previously suspected.  This \r\nincluded the limited presence of cattle, which had not been documented until \r\nthe much later Bronze Age.  Cattle also have recently been reported from \r\nanother Cypro-PPNB site, thus these animals appear to have been part of \r\nthe \"Neolithic Package\" that accompanied the island's first colonists.\r\n\r\nThis research will establish base-line data for the newly defined Cypro-PPNB period.  The project will test models related to variability in the early permanent occupation of Cyprus \r\nwhich is now known to be far more complex than initially believed.  In \r\nparticular, the research examines both the nature of an upland occupation and \r\nthe economic, and possible ritual, impact of cattle in the early Neolithic of \r\nthe island. The work contributes to a better understanding of the trajectory of how early food producing societies spread throughout the Mediterranean area during the tumultuous \"Neolithic \r\nRevolution.\"  It is now clear that Cyprus was an active  participant in this event much earlier than believed.  \r\n\r\nThe Neolithic resulted in both the establishment of the Mediterranean agro-pastoral economic pattern and the ecological degradation associated with food production and high population \r\ndensities that is still being felt in the region today.  It is, therefore, a \r\nrelevant research issue with contemporary significance.  Both Cypriot and U.S. \r\nstudents will join the project, thereby gaining valuable research \r\nexperience.   Archaeology students from the fledging University of Cyprus will \r\nbe encouraged to participate, enhancing joint participation between the U.S. \r\nand Cyprus.\r\n\r\n",
