 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microemulsions are clear, stable, non-toxic fluids made from oil, water and detergent.  Prior research has shown how microemulsions can enhance rates and control pathways of electrolytic chemical formation. The long-term scientific goal is to develop a fundamental understanding of how dynamic processes at interfaces in microemulsions can be used to control reactivity and reaction pathways. From a practical point of view, this project seeks to uncover methodology to make chiral chemicals stereoselectively in microemulsions using films of inexpensive proteins and other chiral catalysts. Chirality, the property of a molecule being non-superimposable on its mirror image, is a key to drug activity. One chiral form of a drug often possesses all the desired activity. The drug industry is currently leading a large effort toward production of chiral drugs, with a future market predicted at over $15 billion.  If developed properly, catalytic synthesis in microemulsions may be an important contributor to future toolboxes of clean chiral synthetic methods. The technological impact of stable, efficient catalytic electrodes and surfaces designed for stereoselective chemical production in microemulsions could be very large. They would enable reusable catalysts to make fine chemicals, such as drugs, employing only electricity and consumable feed reactants. Problems with side products, catalyst recovery, or solvent toxicity would be minimized.\r\n  Specific aims in this project period involve understanding how dynamic interactions between microemulsions, catalytic films, and reactants control reaction rates, pathways and stereochemistry. Representative reactions that are catalyzed by stable films of polymer and protein catalysts will be examined.  A number of modern spectroscopic, microscopic and physical methods will be used to characterize reactant-film interactions with a view to optimizing the reaction systems. \r\n  The broader impact of the work includes fundamental guidance to develop future electrochemical syntheses in relatively inexpensive, low toxicity, water-based fluids. This project will build a basis for future cost-effective, environmentally benign processes to make high value chemicals such as drugs. The project includes a broad-based education component, and will involve high school, college undergraduate, and graduate students, including underrepresented groups and women, in the research. Senior graduate students will be involved in training students at the beginning levels. Mentoring activities will be used at all levels. Students will take advanced courses preparing them for research on the project and will present their research findings at national conferences and workshops. Overall, the project provides a rich training ground in modern cross-disciplinary research and education for participants at several levels of expertise.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n .
