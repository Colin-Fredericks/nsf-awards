 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award provides funds to advance discrete-component metrology that directly impacts manufacturability and inspection of micro-optic components.  The measurement advances are based on self-calibration and homogeneous transformation methods that will allow interferometric measurements of the dimensional errors and optical performance of micro-lenses.  This will significantly reduce measurement uncertainty and increase the types of parts that can be measured.  Transfer of research advances to industry will be accomplished through an industry-sponsored graduate student internship and a continuing education workshop.  The award will also be used to advance graduate education through a laboratory course module on micro-optics metrology and a new course on project management.  High school summer internships will be used to expose local students to the research program by leveraging an existing NSF-funded GK12 program with a local high school.\r\n\r\nIndustry implementation of the metrology advances will improve manufacturing of micro-refractive lenses by improving device yield and reducing testing time and cost, and thereby enhancing U.S. competitiveness in this area.  The research accomplishments will also advance research and manufacturing capabilities under a micro-optics testing and fabrication program at UNC Charlotte.  The program focuses on low-cost/high-volume micro-optic manufacturing research to develop cost-effective manufacturing solutions for micro-optic components and systems.  The program falls at the interface between the Center for Optoelectronics and Optical Communications and the Center for Precision Metrology at Charlotte, and will be orchestrated under the Carolinas MicroOptics Triangle Agreement.  This is a multi-institution agreement aimed at stimulating economic growth in the Carolinas through high-impact research, providing joint access for students and faculty to advanced facilities, and delivering a well-trained workforce in opto-technologies.  The education objectives will enhance the retention and recruitment of students in the area and contribute to the objectives of the MicroOptics Triangle Agreement.",
