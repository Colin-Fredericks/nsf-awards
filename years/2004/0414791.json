 "awd_abstract_narration": "The issues involved in designing efficient checkpointing and recovery techniques for distributed/parallel computations have been extensively studied and are well understood; efficient solutions exist for this problem in this area. However, the issues related to checkpointing and recovery in distributed and mobile database systems as well as distributed object-based systems are not well understood. This project focuses on these issues. More specifically, this project will develop a theoretical framework that addresses the issues related to developing efficient checkpointing and recovery techniques for distributed and mobile database systems as well as distributed object-based systems. Based on the framework, efficient non-intrusive asynchronous checkpointing and recovery techniques will be developed for such systems.\r\nThe important expected broader impacts of this project are: \r\n(i) an improved understating of the issues related to the design and implementation of fault-tolerant distributed and mobile database systems as well as distributed object-based systems; \r\n(ii) availability of efficient checkpointing and recovery techniques for building fault-tolerant distributed and mobile information systems as well as distributed object-based systems would help in building such systems;  (iii) involvement of graduate students in the project will enhance their understanding of the issues related to the design and implementation of fault-tolerant distributed and mobile information systems and also help them  acquire the tools and techniques for building such systems; (iv) the research results from the project will be presented in international conferences and also published in international journals which will benefit the researchers in both academia and industry; (v) the research results will also be integrated in a graduate level course.\r\n",
