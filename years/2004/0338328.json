Co-PIs: Maria Varelas, Tom Moher, Stacy Wenzel, Jeff Lewis\r\nNumber of Fellows per year (graduate vs. undergraduate): 10 graduate, 1 undergraduate\r\nSchool District Partner: Chicago Public Schools\r\nTarget audience of the project (K-12 grade-band): K-12\r\nSetting: Urban\r\nNSF supported disciplines involved: Chemistry, Biology, Computer Science, Earth and Environmental Sciences\r\n\r\nPrevious Project:  The SKIT project evolved out of our Track I project, UIC Graduate Fellows in K-12 Education (NSF DUE-9979537). The prior project was organized around four different interventions in schools in Chicago and two nearby suburbs. Findings show Fellows influenced K-12 education through multiple roles, including that of teacher, curriculum developer, professional developer, student mentor, educational researcher, university representative, and resource gatherer. Teachers reported Fellows helped them plan in advance for lessons and labs; offer one-to-one attention to more students; address topics in deeper and more engaging ways; and offer more hands-on experiences, along with alternative explanations. As Fellows contributed to changes in urban K-12 classrooms, they also gained valuable understandings about the complexities of teaching, learning, and assessing STEM knowledge in diverse settings.\r\n\r\nCurrent Plans: The new SKIT project focuses on and supports the new (2003) Chicago Math and Science Initiative (CMSI) of the Chicago Public Schools (CPS). CMSI includes focused staff development, instructional support for teachers through a cadre of mathematics and science support personnel, increase in instructional time, adoption of standards-based curricula, standardization of assessments, and capital improvements. SKIT Fellows work in three different areas within the CMSI structure: K-8 mathematics and K-8 science, for which CMSI has identified particular curricula that schools may implement; and high school science and mathematics, where Fellows work in department-wide projects and district-wide networks. All Fellows attend CPS professional development activities and assist classroom teachers and specialists in delivery of instruction, assessment of student work, design of classroom-based research, and enhancement and development of curriculum. At UIC, Fellows attend GK-12 summer workshops and academic-year courses to gain an understanding of teaching and learning in urban school settings and to share their CPS experiences.\r\n\r\nThe project's intellectual merit centers on facilitating change through Fellows' participation in several overlapping learning communities. The anticipated broader impact is to support and sustain reformed STEM education in the nation's third largest school system, and allow CPS to benefit much more directly from STEM expertise at UIC as UIC also learns from CPS. The project plan includes a phased transition from an NSF-supported program infrastructure to a sustainable UIC/CPS infrastructure over the course of the grant.\r\n\r\nProject evaluation is organized around a set of 11 specific objectives addressing impact on Fellows, teachers, students, as well as institutional impact on UIC and CPS. Evaluation is based on a broad set of quantitative and qualitative data obtained through participant activity logs and journals, student performance in various assessments, questionnaires, and interviews. Evaluation guides ongoing program development and assess its effectiveness with respect to both particular project objectives and the transition to a self-sustaining program. \r\n\r\nThis project is partially supported by funds from the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\r\n",
