 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: 0405899, J. Rauch, University of Michigan\r\n\r\nApplied Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations \r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator will investigate mathematical problems\r\ninvolving hyperbolic partial differential equations.  These equations\r\nappear in the description of waves which propagate with finite speed,\r\nfor example acoustics, electromagnetism, fluid and aero dynamics,\r\nplasmas, lasers, telegraphy, radio, television, cell phones, shock\r\nwaves, music, power lines, .... etc.  Typical mathematical problems\r\ninvolve showing that specific problems, motivated by applications,\r\nhave solutions and studying their qualitative properties, for example\r\nstability and methods for effective computation.  A first set of\r\nproblems in the proposal concerns the damping of acoustic waves by\r\nenclosing the acoustic cavity in a diffusive medium.  Two situations\r\neasy to understand are the protection of pilots and passengers in\r\nairplanes from the noise of the engines and the absorption of sound in\r\na submarine so that it will not escape to the sea.  There are also\r\napplications to the automatic control of mechanical systems immersed\r\nin fluids.  A second problem concerns the scattering of solutions of a\r\nstrongly nonlinearly damped wave equation.  A third problem is to show\r\nthat the phenomenon of continuum generation in focused laser pulses is\r\na consequence of nonlinear electromagnetic models without ionization.\r\nSelf focused laser beams exhibit continuum generation.  The band of\r\nfrequencies present in the focused beam is much broader and spans a\r\ncontinuum of frequencies (in contrast to a discrete set) than before\r\nthe focusing.  Current explanations are frankly not very convincing.\r\nThis is a fundamental problem long recognized in the laser physics\r\ncommunity.  It is a place where mathematics may add important\r\ninsights.  Focused beams are used in many situations including a\r\nsurprising application to reduce resistance in hypersonic aircraft.\r\n\r\nThe proposer will study the behavior of solutions of the differential\r\nequations that govern the propagation of waves.  One problem\r\ninvestigated is how well sound can be excluded from a region by\r\nenclosing the region is an absorbing layer.  Here the absorption in\r\nthe layer is supposed to be of a diffusive nature, like one would have\r\nfor a gel.  Applications include sonic insulation of airplane\r\nfuselages and submarines and the control of immersed mechanical\r\nsystems.  A second problem to be studied is that of white light\r\ngeneration in focused lasers.  When high power lasers focus, their\r\ncolor changes from the color of the carrier frequency to nearly white\r\nlight.  There are a variety of explanations of this, none very\r\nconvincing. The PI will try to find a better one.  There is convincing\r\nexperimental evidence that the phenomenon does not require ionization\r\nof the propagation medium and this will help to keep the equations\r\nunder study manageable and well founded.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
