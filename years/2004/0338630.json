The conference is aimed predominantly at graduate students and postdocs in physics who are considering applying the methods of physics to biological topics. Physicists and biologists who are leaders in their fields will be asked to give broad overviews of five broad areas at the interface between physics and biology. In addition, there will be a panel of young researchers who will discuss their careers and in particular how they moved their research field from physics to the biology/physics interface.  Funds for the support are provided by the Divisions of Physics and Materials Research in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and by the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Biosciences Directorate.",
