 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interferometric gravitational wave observatories in the United States, Europe and Japan are already collecting data and, thus, are on the verge of making discoveries that will create new opportunities and challenges in physics and astronomy.  One of these challenges is the dual role that numerical simulations have in this large-scale observational effort.  Initially, simulations of sources of\r\ngravitational radiation will assist in the detection of waves.  Once discoveries become routine, they will provide extremely valuable information that will aid in discerning the particular features of the\r\nsources.  The essence of the work in this award is the determination, via controlled numerical experiments, of the generic and characteristic features of gravitational radiation produced by\r\nblack-hole sources.  This work applies to both roles of numerical simulations by providing information about sources that will aid initially in discovery and later in discerning specific features of the sources.\r\n                                                                           \r\nThe broader impact of this award is to enhance and accelerate the connection between numerical relativity and data analysis, a connection that is currently weaker than needed by the gravitational\r\nphysics community.  The work is also an ideal ground for the interdisciplinary training of students and postdoctoral scholars across areas within gravitational physics and astrophysics; students\r\nwho will one day be taking the lead in research involving the new discoveries that will be made by the gravitational wave observatories. The research outlined in this award will benefit from and contribute to the wide spectrum of research already taking place at the Center for Gravitational Wave Physics and the Institute for Gravitational Physics and Geometry at Penn State.",
