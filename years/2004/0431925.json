 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Engineering Department Level Reform Planning grant will integrate service-learning into a broad array of courses so that students will be exposed to service-learning every semester in the core curriculum in every program in the entire college of engineering.  Service-learning has been shown to be effective in a large number of cognitive and affective measures, including critical thinking and tolerance for diversity.  As a result, service learning leads to better knowledge of course subject matter, cooperative learning, recruitment of underrepresented groups in engineering, retention of students, citizenship as well as the meeting of ABET 2000 criteria a-k, well-known to engineering educators. \r\n  \r\nThis grant will be directed toward planning for implementation: faculty recruitment and training, program and course modification, assessment, and dissemination of results.  The implementation and assessment phases of the proposed study are expected to have significant impact on students, faculty, institution, and community.   Expected outcomes of the project to be planned would include, very briefly, increased experiential learning of engineering subject matter, recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in engineering (particularly women), tolerance of diversity, cooperative learning, active citizenship, and a more enlightened and livable local and global community.\r\n",
