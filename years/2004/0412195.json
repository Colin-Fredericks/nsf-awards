This conference is the largest accelerator application conference in the world.  During the conference nuclear physics principles and techniques are shown to have a wide variety of applications in solving modern problems.  In the medical industry these include the use of accelerators in radiation therapy and the production of nuclear isotopes for Positron Emission Tomography, which by any measure is one of the best medical scanning techniques.  During the conference there is also a symposium on Ion Implantation.  Ion Implantation is a technique for using accelerators to implant ions into silicon to produce chips for the semiconductor industry.  Ion implanted chips are used in most household electronics and these products represent a 50 billion dollar a year market.\r\n\r\nApproximately 800 participants from 50 countries will attend CAARI 2004.\r\n",
