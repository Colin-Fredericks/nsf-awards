 "awd_abstract_narration": "Prof. Mahalingham at UC-Riverside has developed a subgrid-scale model for describing combustion of mixture of gases produced by pyrolysis in a typical forest wood fire.  This model, combined with controlled experiments, provides a basis for understanding the spread of wildfires. Similarly, the University of Coimbra in Portugal has developed an active research program in this area, and Portuguese researchers recently visited the labs in California.  This award supports a short visit by the PI to Portugal to share research ideas as to develop a more active collaboration.\r\n\r\nBoth California and Portugal have suffered serious damage from wildfires in the past year, and the two universities (UC-Riverside and Coimbra) have undertaken research to understand better the mechanisms of fire spread and blow-up.  The trip will not only enable the PI to share his ideas and techniques but also to gain access to recent European developments in this field. A better understand of these mechanism can promote control of fires, which are a serious social problem. Also, with the expectation that the visit will lead to future collaboration, there is potential to involve American students in cooperative research and exchanges.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
