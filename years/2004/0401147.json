 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project has two parts:  an investigation of the \r\nindependence numbers of the powers of fixed graphs\r\nand a study of the emergence of a giant component in \r\n`guided' versions of the classical random graph.  The \r\nfirst part is motivated by the many open questions \r\nregarding the Shannon capacities of graphs and focuses \r\non the possible behaviors of the sequence given by the \r\nindependence numbers of the powers of a fixed graph.  \r\nThe odd cycles and their complements are particularly\r\nimportant examples and play a central role in this part\r\nof the project.  While a wide range of techniques -- \r\nincluding algebraic methods -- may be useful here, \r\nrecent progress has come through the interplay of novel \r\nconstructions for, and structural conditions imposed on\r\nlarge independent sets in these graph powers.   In the \r\nsecond part of this project we study the component \r\nstructure in the random graph processes known as \r\nAchlioptas processes, processes in which a pair of \r\nrandom edges is presented in each round and an on-line\r\nalgorithm chooses between them.  Here we are interested \r\nin the existence, timing and nature of a phase \r\ntransition in the size of the largest component.   A \r\nprinciple tool here is the differential equations \r\nmethod for establishing concentration in random graph \r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nThis research is in the area of extremal combinatorics.\r\nQuestions considered in this field are of the form: `How \r\nlarge (or small) can an object that lies in a particular\r\ndiscrete mathematical system and satisfies a certain \r\ncondition be?'  We are often concerned with the behavior \r\nof the size of the extremal objects as the size of the \r\nunderlying system goes to infinity.  Interest in such \r\nquestions grew extensively during the twentieth century.  \r\nPioneers of the field, such as Paul Erd\\H{o}s, posed \r\nmany fascinating questions of this form and devised \r\npowerful methods for solving them even before the close \r\nconnections between extremal combinatorics and various \r\nother fields (including theoretical computer science, \r\nstatistical physics and information theory) were \r\ndiscovered.   The Shannon capacities of graphs are a \r\nclassic example of the close interaction between \r\nextremal combinatorics and the theory of communication.  \r\nThe Shannon capacity gives a measure of the optimal \r\nzero-error performance of a noisy communication channel \r\nand is centrally important in information theory.  At \r\nthe same time, it gives rise to natural questions in \r\nextremal combinatorics and graph theory.  Some of these\r\nquestions are addressed in this research project.\r\n",
