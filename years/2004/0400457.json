 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores how a cognitive-representational approach to early reading can lead to new and efficient instruction that will impact learning across the curriculum. The research questions addressed are:\r\n\r\nWhich design principles are most important for a balanced approach to literacy instruction that uses multimedia environments for integrated, efficient instruction of decoding and word recognition skills?\r\n\r\nWill design principles suggested by research help teachers better understand and integrate decoding skills into their classroom literacy environments?\r\n\r\nCan a combination of video and print materials linked to multimedia environments be effective tools for improving children's home environments and parental support for early reading instruction?\r\n\r\nThe project will investigate these questions by developing an understanding of design principles for children's word recognition fluency and decoding skills using current cognitive theories of mental representations of language.  Within-subject designs will be used to see how different variations of prototype software affect children's word recognition fluency and decoding skills. These initial studies will also include between-subject controls that use no software. At-home reading of both decodable text and rich, high-quality children's literature will be linked to the content and structure of the decoding and word recognition software. This at-home reading will be supported by video exemplars. The children with at-home access to these materials and the software in school will be compared with those children with just the software at school. Additionally, software based on recent cognitive theories will be compared to commercially available software designed to aid children in developing decoding skills by comparing the reading development of children using research software vs. commercially available software. \r\n\r\n",
