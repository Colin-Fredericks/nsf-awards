 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\n\r\nAcquisition of terrestrial cores, samples and other rock material is critical for\r\nconducting many avenues of geologic research. Most academic researchers have access to\r\nspace where cores and samples can be stored during the initial stages of research and\r\nsampling but lack an adequate facility where these materials can be permanently preserved\r\nand accessed by the greater research community. A one-day workshop will bring together\r\ngeoscientists working with terrestrial cores, samples, collections, and other geologic\r\nmaterials that have been acquired as part of academic research projects. The primary goal\r\nof the workshop is to visit a public-sector, state-of-the-art sample repository where\r\nspace is currently available to the academic community and other researchers for long-term\r\nstorage, curation, and easy access to rock material and other collections. Through the\r\nworkshop, participants will identify the needs of the research community and prioritize\r\nthe facilities, equipment, and metadata storage that would best suit the different types\r\nof geologic material to be curated. By establishing a list of priority needs and major\r\nissues facing academic researchers, an effective plan for meeting those needs can be\r\nformulated.",
