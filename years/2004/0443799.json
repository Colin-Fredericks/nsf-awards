 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will design, build and calibrate a collector to obtain time-sequenced records of micrometeorites and terrestrial dust during hot-water drilling through polar ice caps. Micrometeorites are extraterrestrial dust particles less than a millimeter in diameter. Knowledge of the Earth's micrometeorite flux is critical to understanding its chemical evolution. Furthermore, micrometeorites provide important information on the formation and evolution of stars, solar systems, and planets. The prototype collector will serve as a one third scale model of one proposed for use during large scale drilling projects. It will also be operational in its own right for use with small hot-water drills. The collector functions as a replacement to an existing hot-water drill head. It extracts particles from ice onto a self-contained scrolling filter. This project will focus on two critical proof-of-concept issues: (1) collection efficiency and time resolution of the scrolling filter and (2) performance of the shaped drill head. The broader impacts of this work include development of new research infrastructure and support for the participation of two undergraduate students.",
