 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering-Engineering Technology (58)  The project is increasing the supply of engineering technicians and technologists through educational opportunities at a small, rural community college. The University of Dayton and Edison State Community College faculty are aligning administrative functions and curriculum in order to create a degree of integration that will permit the continued delivery of technology leading to a baccalaureate program for rural students in a cost-effective manner. The project is building upon the distance-learning program at the University of Dayton, which is currently offered at the Edison campus. \r\n\r\nSpecific activities include:\r\n1. Developing a joint marketing plan targeting Tech Prep students and women.\r\n2. Leveraging existing marketing strengths at each institution in order to aid each other.\r\n3. Training Edison faculty to assist Edison-based University of Dayton students on advising issues.\r\n4. Establishing cross-enrollment policies and a \"bureaucracy-free\" experience for students in terms of fee payments, book purchases, financial aid, etc.\r\n5. Coordinating scheduling of courses to eliminate duplication of courses and times between University of Dayton and Edison and to increase the number of options available to students.\r\n6. Identifying curricular niches that require special faculty expertise and/or lab equipment.  Once labeled as a curricular niche at one institution, the other institution is not attempting to develop or offer those courses and is enrolling its students at the other college.\r\n7. Publishing an integrated partnerships handbook.  \r\n8. Updating existing articulation agreement to achieve 95 percent transfer efficiency for Edison students transferring to University of Dayton and to implement an outcomes-based model. \r\n",
