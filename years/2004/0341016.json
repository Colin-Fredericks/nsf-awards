 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proof-of-concept project is developing a modular electronic product for use in a Civil Engineering curriculum.  The web-based learning system is being used teach students the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) within the foundational courses of a typical Civil Engineering program.  As opposed to generating a series of GIS courses, the GIS know-how is being introduced within an existing course as a module that will reinforce basic concepts taught in a comprehensive manner.  The prototype has a geotechnical emphasis for inclusion in a typical soil mechanics course.  However, based on the proof-of-concept, the prototype can serve as a template to further develop other modules (environmental, transportation, hydrology, and/or construction) in a potential full development effort.  The principal objectives of this proof-of-concept project are: (1) To create a prototype web-based learning system to support students in learning how to apply GIS within the context of Civil Engineering (geotechnical emphasis) classes; (2) To carry out an initial series of evaluation studies with components and iterations of this system; and (3) To use the prototype system and evaluation data as the foundation for full scale, comprehensive project proposals.  The GIS tool and the Civil Engineering (geotechnical prototype) content were selected because of the importance of these disciplines within the engineering profession and within the broad context of current U.S. infrastructure needs. As a viable learning technology is being developed, a detailed understanding of how students go about using interactive software as a vehicle for learning to solve complex problems is also being formulated. Moreover, the project has the potential to directly impact Civil Engineering programs across the country and indirectly impact GIS instructional technology across other disciplines.\r\n\r\n",
