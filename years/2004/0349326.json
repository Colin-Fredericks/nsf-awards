 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research integrates synthesis and structural characterization with electrochemical and photocatalytic measurements to develop multifunctional inorganic chalcogenides from organic-free systems. New materials prepared from this project will mimic natural zeolites with porous architecture encapsulating mobile inorganic cations. By combining nanoporosity with fast-ion conductivity or photocatalytic activity, these materials can be used as crystalline solid electrolytes, size- or shape-selective photocatalysts, or high-surface-area photo-electrodes and have great potential for applications in a range of economically important technologies such as batteries, electrochemical sensors, solar energy conversion, and fuel cells.  \r\n%%%\r\nThis project is directly related to both short- and long-term National interests of the general public because of its relevance to energy and environmental sciences. In addition, it serves to increase students' exposure and stimulate their interest in frontier areas of solid state and materials chemistry.  It will provide excellent training opportunities in the latest experimental techniques for both undergraduate and graduate students. The project will encourage  diverse participation of students since the University of California - Riverside campus that has the highest African-American and highest Hispanic enrollment of any of the nine University of California campuses. The type of outreach programs under development include the PI's summer 10-week training sessions in materials chemistry offered to both high-school teachers and students.",
