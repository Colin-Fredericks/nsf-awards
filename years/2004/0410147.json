 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)  As part of our continuing effort to integrate new technology into our curriculum, the chemistry department is integrating gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) problem-based laboratories throughout the undergraduate curriculum. The goal is to enliven instruction for our students in general chemistry by studying chemical separations and molecular structure analysis followed by a coordinated progression of learning throughout our curriculum. Graduates of Saint Francis completing this progression of problem-based learning laboratories are expected to be better prepared to face the difficult challenges in industrial as well as graduate school settings.  The training begins in the freshman year with the Virtual Mass Spectrometry Laboratory (VMSL; http://chemed.chem.pitt.edu/VMSL; CCLI Grant  9950867) and initial access to the GC/MS instrument. Dr. Joe Grabowski (University of Pittsburgh) is assisting faculty and students using the interactive internet program, which introduces problem-solving to the students. In the upper level courses, the experiments become more sophisticated with less information provided by the instructor. A problem-based approach is being implemented in instrumental analysis, forensics, environmental, and physical chemistry, where the students are responsible for developing course specific application laboratory projects by using the current literature.  A major application of the GC/MS is in research projects for our newly added concentration of forensic chemistry since GC/MS is a major piece of instrumentation in forensic chemistry laboratories. Dr. Michael Baird who has recently implemented GC/MS into Wheeling Jesuit University laboratories (CCLI Grant 0088357) is serving as a consultant for the project.  Several impacts of the grant include: incorporation of innovative materials and technology across the newly revised curriculum; excitement potential of younger scientists (especially underrepresented groups) through use of technology; students well-trained in problem-solving techniques and prepared for success in advanced degrees/industry; and an increased number of chemistry majors through recruitment potential of new technology. Saint Francis chemistry currently has 31 majors, a 200% increase over the last five years, of which 71 % are women. \r\n",
