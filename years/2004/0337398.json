 "awd_abstract_narration": "The California Science Center (CSC) will develop the \"World of Ecology,\" a 45,000 sq ft permanent exhibition that involves the large-scale fusion of interactive science exhibits with the immersive live-habitat concept of zoos, aquariums and botanical gardens. \r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\r\nThe focus for this project is the Extreme Zone, which will explore how species adapt to their environment.  It contains four habitats:  the Sonoran desert, deep sea hydrothermal vents, polar regions and rocky shores and will include more than 259 terrestrial and aquatic animal and plant species.  The overall goal is to communicate that in every ecosystem the physical and living worlds are connected and shaped by the same fundamental ecological principles.  It will be achieved through the integration of science center exhibits with immersive habitats on a  large scale.  This approach provides an interesting model for the science center, museum, zoo and botanical garden fields.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT \r\nThe target audience is the 1.6 million annual CSC visitors, 57% of whom are from minority populations, with an emphasis on families, elementary and middle school students.  In addition, CSC will enhance the exhibition through outreach programs that serve at-risk students.  All audio-visual programs will be available in Spanish as well as English, and a Spanish language audio guide will be produced.  Collaboration with the Santa Barbara Zoo will bring valuable expertise as well as enhance prospects for dissemination. \r\n\r\n",
