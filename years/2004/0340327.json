 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is intended to design, develop, and evaluate an innovative web-based software application to address a compelling national need to organize emergency resources. The project will develop an innovative Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) database design to provide a flexible, scaleable platform to meet the needs for a next generation National emergency resource system.  Effective communication systems linking stakeholders responding to emergency events are critical to the Nation's preparedness but a standardized, national-level, flexible system is not yet available. The main Phase One activities are:  (1) remodel the current database as an EAV system; (2) design web-based application tools that provide the ability to generate aggregate hierarchical views of the data at multiple levels, and agile messaging; and (3) build a prototype system and convert/replicate a set of current data, using it with the new prototype system for performance, scalability and user evaluation during test scenarios.\r\n\r\nCommercial application of this project will provide first responders with ability to simultaneously monitor the status of emergency resources, and to distribute messages and queries to emergency personnel in local and regional areas. Successful development and implementation will result in major improvements in the Nation's preparedness.\r\n\r\n",
