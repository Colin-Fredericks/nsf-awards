 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal calls for the third in a series of congresses on geometry to be held in Salamanca (Spain) June 11-15, 2004.  The themes of the conference will be Riemann surfaces (related in important ways to automorphic forms, theta functions, etc), Teichmuller theory, complex dynamics and modular forms.  The previous conferences have seen evidence of important collaborations between the US and the Hispanic world (these were held in Mexico and Chile).  As an example of the impact of these conferences, we note that six of 19 and six of 22 papers in the two volumes of proceedings from the first two conferences involve such collaborations. The funding will cover expenses for five junior and five senior researchers.\r\n\r\nAmong speakers who will be attending (at this stage, 5/04) are Ava Basmajian, Dick Canary, John Hubbard, Sebastian Casalaina-Martin, Edward Frenkel, Gavril Farkas and Samuel Grushovsky. \r\n\r\n",
