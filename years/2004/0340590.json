In contrast to existing 3D seismic analyses, the proposed imaging technology will revolve around a Boundary Integral Equation (BIE) method so that only the outline of a hidden object is rendered. This boundary-only sensing approach has its origins in radar and sonar technologies, but has been largely unexplored in the context of seismic surveys. The need for imaging of subterranean objects spans many aspects of society, ranging from civil engineering to exploration seismology, environmental remediation, and homeland security applications.\r\n\r\nThe project involves research groups led by Bojan Guzina at the University of Minnesota and Marc Bonnet at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, France. They recently developed a prototype algorithm, which demonstrates that BIE formulations could significantly reduce the computational effort needed to identify underground openings.  Building on this initial development, the research would focus on robustness for a wider class of subterranean conditions.  They plan to proceed to a proof-of-concept phase aimed at implementing the new sensing technology.   U.S. graduate students will participate in the project, developing skills in international research and establishing international ties early in their careers.\r\n\r\nThe project will advance the development of a novel, boundary-only imaging technique for robust seismic delineation of underground objects.  Potential applications of this research include rapid detection of underground facilities and unexploded ordnances, cost-effective mapping of subterranean infrastructure in urban areas, and non-invasive delineation of buried waste. The need for fast and economic 3D seismic imaging in these areas is especially pronounced in situations where current electromagnetic surveys may be inadequate.   \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS).  NSF provides support for visits to France by the U.S. investigators and students.  The CNRS covers the costs of visits to the United States by the French investigators.\r\n\r\n",
