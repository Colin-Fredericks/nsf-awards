Working in teams, the group will come to consensus in identifying video clips that illustrate quality and coherent mathematics teaching and learning.  The data collected during the work session will be used to develop a guide, tentatively called the \"TIMSS 1999 Video Study Guide:  Mathematics,\" to accompany the TIMSS 1999 public release mathematics lessons.\r\n",
