A common theme of this project, and also of the research of the PI\r\nover the past several years, is the important role of the nodal sets of\r\nsolutions to differential equations, or in general the level sets of the\r\nfunctions involved. The problems discussed in the project involve differential\r\nequations of various types, elliptic, hyperbolic and of mixed type. Some\r\nproblems have close connections with other fields in mathematics, including\r\nseveral complex variables and algebraic geometry. One class of problems that\r\nthe PI would continue to work on includes the geometric structure of level sets\r\nof solutions, in particular the nodal sets, the singular sets and the branch\r\nsets. An important part of the study is the investigation of the asymptotic\r\nbehavior of solutions near these sets or the asymptotic behavior of these sets\r\nthemselves. Another class of problems that the PI would continue to work on\r\ninvolves the effect of level sets of known functions in the equations on the\r\nproperties of solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problems involving singular sets originate from the material science and the\r\ncontrol theory. Singular sets, as the name suggests, are those sets where\r\nsingularities occur. Precise definitions vary according to problems where they\r\narise. In reality it is impossible to eliminate the singular sets, the\r\nso-called `bad sets'. One of the central tasks is to identify the conditions\r\nunder which the singular sets can be controlled and the conditions under which\r\nthe singular sets are small. The proposed problems concerning singular sets in\r\nthe project are in their simplest forms. They are related to the Erickson's\r\nmodel for liquid crystals and the Ginzburg-Landau equation in the\r\nsuperconductivity. The PI believes that the discussion of these mathematical\r\nproblems would improve the methods to control the singular sets in various\r\napplications.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
