 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for improvements in roads and for construction of additional housing at the Adirondack Ecological Center (AEC).  The goal of the project is the expansion of the AEC's accessibility, improvement in its utility for research and educational use by students, and the provision of improved accommodations for visiting scientists. The construction of two new bunkhouses will alleviate overuse of existing buildings of historic value.  In the past 10 years the AEC has made important contributions to understanding the dynamics of the Adirondack forest, including the structure of vertebrate populations and the complex nature of biogeochemistry. In addition to findings of basic interest, these studies are leading to creative solutions to problems, such as overabundant deer, that have implications far beyond the Adirondacks.   In addition to research, AEC programs expose students to the complexities of the Northern Forest ecosystem and the fascination of field biology.  Expanding onsite accommodations for students, educators and researchers will be an important step toward accelerating intellectual development of the link between research and education at the AEC.",
