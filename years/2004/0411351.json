 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12) An Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AA) is being used as the centerpiece for developing a research project based chemistry lab curriculum that has been introduced into the third quarter of General Chemistry.  The AA is being used by students to study the phytoremediation of heavy metals by plants as a means for environmental detoxification.  Analytical methods from both the educational and research literature are being adapted for use in the project.  Using the AA, General Chemistry students are conducting ongoing research projects that are providing them with experience with the scientific method and that are allowing them to experience the interconnectivity between chemistry and biology.  An artificial marsh is being utilized by students to research the effects of various physical parameters on the uptake of heavy metals by plants and to screen local marsh plants for their ability to hyperaccumulate heavy metals.  After incorporating the AA and the research studies into the General Chemistry lab curriculum, the project will be expanded to include faculty who teach in the areas of physical science, biology and geology at both the college and local high schools.",
