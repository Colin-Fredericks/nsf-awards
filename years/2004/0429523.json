Katti\r\nNorth Dakota State University Fargo\r\n\r\nAlgorithms to recode a binary number into a signed binary number (such numbers have \r\ndigits {0,1,-1}) will be developed by the proposed work. The main advantage of the \r\nalgorithms  developed  is  that  they  examine  the  binary  numbers  from  left-to-right.  The \r\nalgorithms must result in minimal joint weight to reduce the number of operations in the \r\nmulti-exponentiation operation used in cryptography. Developing such  algorithms for \r\nmore than one integer has never been done before. In fact this was considered as a hard \r\nproblem  in  the  literature.  The  PI  developed  a  left-to-right  recoding  algorithm  for  two \r\nintegers that resulted in minimal joint weight. This resulted in a solution to a problem that \r\nhad been an open problem since 2001. Extending this to the general case  of N integers \r\nwill be considered. This extension is no trivial task because the only known solution to \r\nminimal  joint  weight  recoding  of  N  integers  examines  the  integers  from  right-to-left. \r\nExamining the integers from left-to-right makes the algorithm compatible with Shamir.s \r\nleft-to-right multi-exponentiation method. This leads to less memory requirement for \r\nmulti-exponentiation, which is very important in memory-constrained systems like smart \r\ncards. Other extensions like recoding for  sliding window methods of multi-\r\nexponentiation will also be considered. In this case the algorithms developed, other than \r\nbeing left-to-right will also maximize the length  of zeros between windows. This again \r\nresults  in  decreasing  memory  requirement  while  increasing  the  speed  of  multi-\r\nexponentiation. Recoding with other digit sets like {0,1,-1,3,-3} will also be considered. \r\nRecodings developed by the proposed project are useful in cases where group inversion is \r\nvery fast. Such groups include the elliptic curve group, groups of rational divisor classes \r\nof hyperelliptic curves, trace zero varieties and XTR subgroups.  \r\n \r\n",
