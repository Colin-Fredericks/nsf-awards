 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project continues modeling analyses of the observations acquired during the Tropospheric Ozone Production about the Spring Equinox (TOPSE) experiment in order to better understand controlling influences on the seasonal cycle of tropospheric ozone at high northern latitudes.  Seasonal trends, dynamics and latitudinal distributions of ozone and selected photochemically important trace gases measured from aircraft during TOPSE will be characterized, and further analyzed to identify specific factors controlling the observational data.  By combining multi-scale modeling approaches global-to-regional coupled chemistry-transport simulations will be conducted to better understand the relative contributions and interplay between natural and anthropogenic precursor emission sources on observed tropospheric ozone - still a critical issue with respect to atmospheric chemistry on larger spatial scales.  Results from this study will improve our understanding of how natural and human-induced emissions are affecting the atmosphere and a better characterization on the seasonal cycle of tropospheric ozone at high northern latitudes will offer improved insight on how human activity impacts the chemistry of the troposphere and global climate.  Two graduate students will be supported to conduct the modeling and analyses under the direction of the P.I., as will undergraduate students who participate in the project through a program of intensive summer research experience.",
