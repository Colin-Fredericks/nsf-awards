 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this award, supported by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. George Flynn of Columbia University will conduct research on (1) the self-assembly of molecules at interfaces, both liquid-solid and vacuum-solid interfaces, and (2)  the reaction mechanism of carbon tetrachloride on iron oxide surfaces.  Experiments will utilize scanning tunneling microscopy techniques, combined with temperature programmed desorption measurements.  Some of the studies in (1) will be complemented with a coupled theoretical program, in collaboration with the Berne group at Columbia University.  \r\n\r\nThe studies by Prof. Flynn should provide important insight into some of the processes that drive self-assembly.  These insights are necessary in order to begin to undertake the intelligent control and manipulation of self-assembly at interfaces - -  which could likely have a broad impact in many technological areas, from new electro-optical materials to chemical and biological sensors.  In addition, the study of reactions of carbon tetrachloride at iron oxide surfaces is expected to contribute to the understanding of the oxidation of this halocarbon in the environment.  Prof. Flynn's work will also contribute to the education and training of post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate student researchers. \r\n",
