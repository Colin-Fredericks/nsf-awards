Sensors comprise a core component in any viable structural health monitoring system. To overcome the problems associated with widely used piezoelectric ceramic materials, this project sets forth to develop a polymer-based piezoelectric paint sensor that can be deployed on existing or new structures for real-time monitoring the onset and progression of structural damages. The proposed research encompasses the study of the basic material aspects of piezoelectric paint, sensor deployment on structural components with complex geometry, crack detection strategies, a novel in situ fabrication technique for piezoelectric paint, as well as a detailed understanding of the underlying principles and limitations of piezoelectric paint sensors. This exploratory research will significantly advance the scientific knowledge in sensor technology and smart materials. The successful completion of the proposed research will offer a novel sensor technology potentially addressing the needs of low-cost, low-power-consumption sensors for real-time structural health monitoring of civil and mechanical systems. Education and outreach activities are planned to target a diverse group of students at all levels. A dedicated project website will be established to provide key project information, interactive training activities for interested researchers, practicing engineers and students. Additionally, the proposed work will bring new modules into existing outreach programs at Lehigh University.\r\n",
