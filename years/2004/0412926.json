 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program provides funds to the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao, to purchase two instruments, a high power optical microscope with image processing capability and a semiconductor analyzer. The instruments will be used in nanoscience related research and training. The first project is the fabrication and electrical characterization of conducting polymer nanofibers using a simple electrospinning technique. In this method, the polymer dissolved in an appropriate solvent is placed in a hypodermic needle. By applying a high voltage to the needle, the polymer solution is forced out from the needle in the form of a jet, and as the solvent evaporates, ultra fine fibers of the polymer can be generated. The second project is the fabrication of carbon nanotubes using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques. The nanofibers and nanotubes will be electrically connected in a field effect transistor configuration. The purpose is to be able to fabricate electronic devices. The optical microscope will be used in selecting good samples for characterization and to study electro chromic effects in the polymer nanofibers in-situ while there is an external current flowing through the fiber. Electro chromic effects on bulk conducting polymers have been done in the past but not in nanofibers. The instruments will also be used in Senior Lab for specialized experiments related to nanotechnology. The instruments are of the multi-user type and will enhance research collaboration with the Department of Physics and Electronics and the Biology Department. The acquisition will strengthen the undergraduate program in Physics and Electronics at the University and the research and education program in the Southeast part of the island \r\n\r\nThis award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao, with the acquisition a high power optical microscope with image processing capability and a semiconductor analyzer.
