Samy El-Shall, Department of Chemistry, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia and Dr. Nagi R. Ebrahim, Department of Chemistry, Suez Canal University, Ismailia, Egypt.  This project deals with the development of efficient catalysts based on nanostructured materials to minimize pollution in the environment. Specifically, novel catalysts will be developed for the catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide since even minimal exposure to carbon monoxide can be lethal. The project combines the laser methods developed at Virginia Commonwealth University in the USA with the chemical methods developed at Suez Canal University in Egypt, to synthesize and characterize a new family of efficient nanoparticle catalysts for the removal of harmful gases and chemical contaminants from the environment.  The work at VCU will deal with the synthesis of nanoparticle catalysts by the laser vaporization controlled condensation method. The work at Suez Canal University will deal with the preparation of transition metal catalysts by chemical methods.  The proposed research will result in a better understanding of the molecular processes and the mechanisms of the reactions involved in heterogeneous catalysis. The resulting catalysts are expected to provide efficient means for catalytic oxidation of air contaminants. \r\n \r\nScope and broad impact:  Successful results will likely initiate new efforts for a variety of environmental applications involving both the industrial and commercial sectors in Egypt and the US.  The cooperative research is expected to lead to economic development in both countries.  In addition, the project has broad implications in the education and training of graduate students and junior scientists in the multi-disciplinary research areas of catalysis, nanoparticles, environmental chemistry, and materials science. The proposed research will introduce the new area of research on nanostructure materials to the Egyptian scientific community. This is expected to open new fields of research with promising applications in advanced materials, sensors and devices. This project is being supported under the US-Egypt Joint Fund Program, which provides grants to scientists and engineers in both countries to carry out these cooperative activities.\r\n",
