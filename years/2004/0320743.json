This project involves the use of one such technique, namely the Quartz Crystal Microbalance, to probe critical issues of importance to this field.   A first set of experiments will explore the role of electronic and phononic energy dissipative mechanisms in the recently discovered, and increasingly controversial phenomenon of superconductivity-dependent friction. Magnetic fields perpendicular and parallel to adsorbed layers sliding on Pb and Nb substrates will be employed to drive the system in and out of the superconducting state. A second set of studies involves documentation of the impact of sliding on the two-dimensional melting point of monolayer thick Krypton layers adsorbed on Graphene sheets with variable lattice spacing. The goal of these studies is to probe the temperature of a simplified sliding contact, a quantity that has been exceptionally difficult to quantify from theoretical, experimental and computational approaches.  The third set of proposed experiments involves operation of a QCM in conjunction with a blowoff apparatus recently developed at IBM Almaden. The goal here is to explore the linearity of friction laws governing molecularly thin liquid films over a wide range of length and time scales. A complimentary educational component includes (1) ongoing participation of undergraduates in the  research,  and (2) direct dissemination of state-of-the-art information on friction to instructors developing curriculum on the topic, as well as to more general audiences through lectures and written reviews.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
