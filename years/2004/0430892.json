 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves the development, installation, and \r\nverification of a collection of error control codes that \r\nare employed across base stations to vastly improve the \r\nperformance of public safety radio systems (i.e. those \r\nused by police officers and firefighters).  In particular, \r\nrecent events have demonstrated the stringent demands placed \r\non public safety radio systems in times of extreme crisis.  \r\nSuch systems must handle high-priority delay-sensitive voice \r\ntransmissions that often need to be broadcast to a large number \r\nof receivers over the challenging wireless communications channel.  \r\nThe wireless channel can introduce significant signal fading, and \r\nthe narrowband frequency allocations and current collection of \r\nsingle-antenna base stations in public safety radio systems \r\nmake it difficult to combat the effects of such fading using \r\npreviously considered techniques.  Employing a single error \r\ncontrol code across multiple base stations can improve the \r\nbroadcast to a group of system users in the area, but there \r\nare a number of technical barriers to such an approach.  \r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem is that, because of the large geographical \r\narea covered by the transmitting base stations, the relative time \r\nof arrival at the receiver of signals from different base stations \r\ncan vary greatly, and, since the application is partial broadcast, \r\nno amount of relative transmission timing can remedy such.  The \r\nresearch team has demonstrated that many standard space-time \r\nschemes lose diversity versus signal fading in such a situation; \r\nhowever, the team is developing families of codes that are robust \r\nto this offset, thus preserving diversity against fading across the \r\ncoverage area.  These codes are termed \"macroscopic space-time \r\ncodes,\" which, in addition to being developed, are being verified \r\non the OpenSky testbed of partner M/A-COM, Inc.\r\n",
