 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under this award the PIs will drill the reef at Tarawa Atoll (1N, 172E) in the central tropical Pacific in attempt to reconstruct El Nino/La Nina (ENSO) variability over the past 10K years. The PIs propose to measure sea surface salinity and temperature based on the  18O geochemical proxy. The PIs pilot study at Tarawa Atoll shows that typical ENSO events occurred as early at 7,760 years before present, during a time when some researchers say they did not detect evidence for ENSO in Ecuador lake sediments.  \r\nENSO tropical Pacific ocean/atmosphere anomalies  are  a  dominant  source  of  global  climate  variability,  sometimes  having catastrophic consequences.   Instrumental data  and intermediate and  coupled models indicate that decadal and possibly millennial-scale sea surface temperature variability in the tropical Pacific have similar anomaly patterns to the El Nino/La Nina anomaly fields.  A remarkable  finding that the ENSO fluctuations of ocean/climate change were absent in terrestrial climate proxy records between 5,000 and 12,000 years before present has sparked new research in the ENSO modeling and paleoceanographic communities.  Climate data for the past century show that some regions have changed their climate response to ENSO, as the frequency and intensity of tropical Pacific anomalies changed.   \r\n",
