 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative research by Dr. Thomas Ranker of the University of Colorado and Dr. Jennifer Geiger of Carroll College, Montana, will investigate the biogeographical and evolutionary origins of the fern flora of the Hawaiian Islands. Molecular studies of species within several selected genera will be conducted to understand evolutionary relationships. Comparative analyses of the evolutionary relationships and biogeographical histories of the groups studied will allow for the testing of climate- and weather-based hypotheses of wind dispersal of spores to the Hawaiian Islands. Such comparisons will allow for an assessment of the possibility that long-distance wind dispersal to the archipelago has been essentially random across groups or if there are common patterns across groups due to the existence of common dispersal routes. The proposed research will make a significant contribution to our understanding of the historical biogeography of an evolutionarily and ecologically important and under-studied group of plants in the Hawaiian Islands and around the Pacific region. Because\r\nthe ancestors of many native Hawaiian plants, fungi, and insects undoubtedly arrived via long-distance wind dispersal to the islands, this research will provide new insights into the origin and diversification of native groups of organisms in the Hawaiian Islands. In addition, hypotheses about evolutionary relationships will be generated for several groups of Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian ferns that will provide a basis for and lead to future, more detailed evolutionary studies. \r\nThe proposed research will have a significant impact on the development of human resources by providing training and first-hand experience in evolutionary\r\nbiology, systematics, biogeography, tropical biology, molecular techniques, and data analysis to graduate students at CU-Boulder and four or more undergraduate students per year at Carroll College and CU-Boulder. Several programs exist at the University of Colorado to encourage undergraduate students to become involved with research projects. PI Ranker regularly works with and mentors such students, including participants in the Summer Multicultural Access to Research and Training program. PI Ranker will recruit two or more students per year through these programs to assist with the proposed research, both in the field and in the laboratory, as honor's and independent\r\nresearch students. Similarly, PI Geiger will recruit two or more students per year to assist with the proposed research at Carroll College, which is an undergraduate institution. Students will assist with the proposed research by participating in the honors thesis program. Students completing honors theses will present a poster display of their work at the Carroll College Department of Natural Sciences annual Manion Symposium. Students from Carroll College will also have the opportunity to participate in this research during the summer months at CU-Boulder working in PI Ranker's laboratory. Gaining experience at a research university will broaden students' perspectives and experiences and help prepare them as they progress toward a professional job or a graduate\r\neducation. Students will be involved with all phases of this work, including the co-authoring of publications and presenting the results of research at professional meetings.\r\n",
