 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to lead to development of embedded propagation measurement circuits that will be used as an applique in conjunction with broadband wireless networks. It is predicated on the principle that it is better to learn about signal strength, path distortion, etc., of non-line-of-sight transmission channels ahead of time rather than placing queries into data packets. Current systems over-compensates for this lack of foreknowledge through redundant transmissions, repeat requests, oversizing transmit power, or by placing limitations on useful range of operations. Research will emphasize performance of trade studies and analyses to optimize algorithms so that they work to the highest possible levels of channel stress including, but not limited to lowest signal-to-noise ratio, highest rates of Doppler, worst multipath, longest range, and highest number of redundancy antennas. \r\n\r\nWireless non-line-of-sight techniques such as multiple input multiple output (MIMO), smart antennas, turbo coding, and diversity combining, will benefit equipment suppliers because now they will be able to reuse most of their internal modem designs and still take advantage of the applique nature of this product. This technology will benefit the following groups of users: 1) rural communities, 2) first response groups such as Fire and Rescue, Police, Ambulance services, and Airport Security, 3) people working in groups that require mobility, outdoor work, and 4) close cooperative communications over large distances such as Agriculture, Maritime Trades, Forestry, Oil Drilling, Utilities Operations, Construction and Military personnel. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
