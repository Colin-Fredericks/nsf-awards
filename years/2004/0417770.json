 "awd_abstract_narration": "Monson, Peter A., et al\r\nU of Massachusetts - Amherst\r\n\r\n \"A Multiprocessor Computing System for Nanoscale Science and Engineering Research in Chemical Engineering.\"\r\n\r\nThis grant provides funding for the purchase of a 64-processor parallel computer system for modeling research in nanoscale science and engineering in the Chemical Engineering\r\nDepartment at the University of Massachusetts. This computing facility will allow the study of large model systems across multiple length and time scales, as well as systematic parametric analyses using a range of modeling techniques including molecular computer simulation and quantum chemistry. The equipment will serve the computation needs of eight research projects in the groups of five faculty. Peter Monson's group will use the new facilities for research projects on fluids confined in nanoporous materials, solid-fluid phase equilibrium and modeling the growth of nanoporous materials. Dimitrios Maroudas' group will use the equipment for their research on multiscale modeling of growth, processing and reliability of electronic materials. Phillip Westmoreland's group will use the facilities for their work in applying computational quantum chemistry in reaction engineering. In addition adjunct professor Scott Auerbach's group will use the facilities for his work on modeling adsorption and reaction in zeolite molecular sieves. Jeffery Davies's group will use the facilities for his work on modeling transport in free\r\nsurface flows with application in microfluidics.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: A predominant theme among the research projects to be supported by the new computing facilities is fundamental nanoscale science and engineering research in areas where there is a close connection with practical application. As an example, the development of new types of porous materials with nanoscale properties tailored for specific applications is a major area of research throughout the world. Understanding of how the collective behavior of adsorbed molecules is influenced by the nanostructure of the porous material can contribute significantly in this effort. The PIs are approaching the point where adsorption experiments can be accompanied by a much more sophisticated understanding of the structure at small length scales. Peter Monson's project in this area could provide a foundation for new approaches to the characterization of porous materials. The range of impact extends across the range of applications of porous materials from traditional areas such as adsorption and catalysis to emerging nanotechnology applications which exploit details of the small scale structure.\r\n\r\nResearch in the department has consistently had a strong educational component through the involvement of graduate students, postdoctoral scholars and undergraduates. The equipment requested will be used by 15 graduate students, 8 postdoctoral researchers as well as undergraduates engaged in independent study projects. The junior researchers involved will learn important techniques in parallel computation for engineering applications. The faculty involved have an established record of bringing nanoscale science and engineering modeling into the Chemical Engineering curriculum and these activities will be supported by the new facilities.\r\n\r\n",
