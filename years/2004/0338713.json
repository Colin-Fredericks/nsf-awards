The project will advance understanding of turbulent and laminar flows of electrically conducting liquids affected by magnetic fields.  Primary attention will be paid to anisotropic manetohydrodynamic turbulence and interface instability in shallow two-layer systems of electrically conducting liquids.  Those subjects are important for continuous casting of steel and production of primary aluminum in the electrolytic reduction process.  The benefits of the collaborative activities stem from the coordination of moderate and high magnetic field experiments in Ilmenau and high-performance direct numerical simulation and large eddy simulation calculations in Dearborn.  The expected results include, numerical support for the design of experiments and evaluation of measured results, and use of experimental data for verification of numerical models and evaluation of empirical model constants.  The international dimension of the research will have significant impact on the research environment at both institutions and will positively affect the career development of junior faculties, post-doctoral researchers and students involved in the project.\r\n",
