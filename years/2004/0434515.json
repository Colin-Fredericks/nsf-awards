 "awd_abstract_narration": "Within this project, a novel technique that can be used to detect shared conges-tion between any two Internet paths is discovered, called Delay Correlation with Wavelet denoising (DCW). With this technique, a common end point (source or destination) for synchronization is not needed.  More specifically, DCW works efficiently and effectively for a synchronization offset of up to one second, which is large enough for detecting shared congestion between any two Internet paths.  Furthermore, DCW works effectively irrespective of whether Random Early Dis-card (RED) or drop-tail queueing method is used at the point of congestion. To apply DCW to specific applications, new protocols are designed that specify how nodes generate probes, collect and process delay samples for Internet paths with no common end point, and provide the shared congestion detection out-come to the applications. The protocols include a loose synchronization tech-nique to limit any synchronization offset between probe sequences to the maxi-mum value.  Protocols are designed for applications that run on overlay net-works with both tree and mesh topologies with the objective of improving the applications' performance by removing shared bottlenecks.  The DCW technique is expected to enable the design of protocols that construct overlay networks with improved topologies where shared bottlenecks are removed.  Such applica-tion of DCW will contribute toward the design of next-generation research net-works and tools for interdisciplinary collaboration, as well as shared research and education platforms.\r\n\r\n",
