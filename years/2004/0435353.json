Successful realization of such systems hinges on systematic methodologies to address and resolve bottleneck issues. Sensor network operation and lifetime is fundamentally limited by energy, a particular concern in environmental applications that necessitate long-term deployment.  The project systematically interfaces new techniques for data networking and distributed information-processing to realize scalability and massive energy efficiencies in sensor network operation.  The employed methods include novel semantic routing techniques and in-network localized distributed inferencing algorithms. A challenging ecological application, which is representative of the challenges arising in environmental monitoring, is addressed as proof-of-concept.  Successfully completed project will lead to (1)  an enabling technique for building systems to monitor and understand our environment and thus provide a framework for evaluating broad policy questions relevant to society; (2) new techniques and theories to advance the viability of large scale sensor networks as an engineering challenge; (3) novel, unanticipated insights and technologies in biology, geography, and engineering, which are bridged by the interdisciplinary effort; (4)  scientific tools for scientists, educators, students, and like-minded individuals who might apply the results of the project.  The results of the project will be disseminated through scholarly venues, journal, conference and online publications.\r\n",
