Malinowski is the coordinator of SNAP, which includes participants from France, Italy, Poland, and Spain, who represent IP service providers, equipment manufacturers, and universities.  Its goal is to specify, develop and integrate innovative telecommunication technology by exploring such concepts as service architecture, man-machine interface, data-path reporting, and authentication. \r\n\r\nThe participation of the PI is expected to lead to collaborative research.  The RPI team's expertise is complementary to that of SNAP, thus leveraging the European investment.  The RPI group has both tools and experience developed for distributed simulation of large networks, which will be used in SNAP's simulation experiments.  RPI will also participate in the development of the tools for intrusion detection, and will conduct research on network economics.  \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
