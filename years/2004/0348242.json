 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award supports efforts to generate the knowledge required to create low-cost, high-performance manipulators and fixtures capable of nanometer-level alignment. The scholarly merit of the work is contained in the generation and experimental validation of models which aim to predict the performance of:  (1) 3D compliant mechanisms for monolithic Nanomanipulators:  The PI will conduct research on a new process that forms low-cost, high-performance six-axis Nanomanipulators.  In this process, forming and folding are used to transform a 2D sheet (template) into a 3D compliant mechanism.  This process forms the structure and bearings of a manipulator within one piece.  Models will be developed to link the topologies of the template and 3D mechanism to Nanomanipulator alignment performance.  (2) Detachable fixtures with nanometer-level accuracy:  This research aims to generate fixture technology for Nanomanufacturing processes.  The PI will model the influence of hard coatings on the stability and repeatability of fixture contact interfaces.  Models will also be developed to aid in the synthesis of fixtures which automatically correct misalignment via integrated actuation and sensing.  If this work is successful, the combination of improved stability and error correction will enable fixtures with nanometer-level accuracy and repeatability.\r\n\r\nThe cost and quality of products based on Nanomanufacturing technology will be influenced by the cost and performance of manipulation and fixturing equipment.  Present alignment technologies are at their practical cost-performance limits and therefore not attractive options for next generation Nanomanufacturing processes.  If successful, this research will generate the knowledge required to make monolithic machine tools and ultra-precision fixtures which are well-suited to provide low-cost, nanometer-level alignment.  This will enable:  (1) Reduced cost and improved quality of products or product components made via Nanomanufacturing processes (2) Researchers to more accurately characterize nano-scale devices and manufacturing processes.  The broader impacts will be further enabled through established connections to industry (e.g., Ford, GM) and educational efforts such as innovative hands-on, discovery-based learning and design courses, and mentoring of underrepresented minorities.\r\n",
