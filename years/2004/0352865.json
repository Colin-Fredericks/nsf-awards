 "awd_abstract_narration": "626- Considerable advancements have been made toward understanding the climate forcing mechanisms and subsequent atmospheric circulation patterns that are required for the initiation of  the Laurentide  Ice  Sheet  (LIS) at  the  end  of  the  last  interglacial  116 thousand years (kyr  B.P.)  Yet, the relative importance of these forcing  mechanisms,  and  their  relationship  to  atmospheric  variability  on  interannual  and  longer  time  scales,  have  not  been  determined.  The Principal Investigators will undertake a comprehensive and systematic modeling investigation of the initiation and inception of the LIS over northeastern  Canada,  using  state-of-the-art  high-resolution climate and ice sheet models to determine the role of  climate forcings, their influence on natural climate variability, and the impact of model resolution on the results obtained. \r\nObjectives and Justification:  The Principal Investigators will model the atmospheric  state  in  the  contemporary  and  last  interglacial environments using the Polar MM5 regional climate model and the NCAR Community Climate System  Model  2 (CCSM2).  CCSM2 will produce  global-scale  descriptions  of  the  atmosphere, ocean, sea-ice cover, and land surface while Polar MM5, developed specifically for high-latitudes,  will  yield  high-resolution  descriptions  of  the  regional  atmospheric  circulation  and surface  characteristics  over  the  likely  initiation  region  of  the  LIS.  From the contemporary environment, which is characterized by large  interannual  variability,  they will identify modern  analogs for  glacial initiation,  that  is, distinct modes  of  atmospheric  circulation that yield exceptional winter precipitation and cool summer temperatures in northeastern Canada.  Data from these periods will be used in Polar MM5 simulations of several idealized modern scenarios to determine the relative importance of cool summers versus wet winters in achieving perennial snow cover. Coupled CCSM2/Polar MM5 simulations of the climate at 116 kyr B.P. will be conducted, using appropriate orbital, trace gas,  and  vegetation  boundary  conditions,  to determine  whether  the  interannual  variability  from  the  coupled  climate  models  is  sufficient  to achieve  glacial  initiation  on  appropriate  time  scales  and  in  the  correct  locations.  Snapshot output from the Polar MM5 will be  input  to  a  high-resolution,  three-dimensional  ice  sheet downscaling routine and ice sheet model for multi-millennial ice sheet simulations to determine whether the climate model snowfields are sufficient for glacial inception to occur. The location and timing of the model ice sheet will bevalidated  against  observed  glacial  geology  and geomorphology  in  the  study  region.  Guided by the results from the contemporary and last interglacial model simulations,  specific  sensitivity  tests  will  be conducted  to  isolate  the  critical climate forcing  mechanisms  for  glacial  initiation  and  inception  to  occur  at  116  kyr  B.P.\r\nIntellectual Merit and Broader Impacts:  This project brings together a team of  highly  qualified  scientists  with  expertise  in meteorology, climate, glaciology, and glacial geology, along with sophisticated numerical models to address for the first time the explicit atmospheric processes occurring on various temporal and spatial  scales  that  lead  to  glacial  initiation.  Coupling an explicit representation of climate to a high-resolution ice sheet model will greatly advance  our  understanding  of  the  importance  of climate  forcing  variability  on  ice  sheet  inception  at  both  the  last  interglacial  and  the  current interglacial. Because the relative roles of  natural  variability  and  anthropogenic  forcing  are  of very important  to  possible  future  climate  changes,  a  better  understanding  of  climate variability at the last interglacial-glacial transition will have important implications for potential societal impacts in a future climate scenario. There will be abundant material available for educational outreach at elementary/ secondary schools, university classes, and  through an interactive Internet web site. Two Ph.D. students will receive training through this research project and summer internships will be offered to inner city high school youth to develop their science skills. \r\n\r\n",
