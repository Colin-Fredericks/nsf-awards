 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance (MMSA) is working with AAAS Project 2061 to systematically identify and describe web-based phenomena and representations to determine whether they are aligned with state and national content standards, informed by cognitive research, and likely to improve the quality of middle school science instruction. The resources are being assembled into a collection called PRISMS (Phenomena and Representations for the Instruction of Science in Middle Schools), designed to increase the amount of quality K-12 science educational content accessible through digital libraries. Using Project 2061's curriculum-materials analysis procedure, the PI and colleagues are working with middle school teachers to analyze approximately 1,000 science and mathematics and technology items connected to science benchmarks, for their alignment to middle grades content standards and for the quality of their instructional support for teachers. The PRISMS collection provides pointers to aligned items available online, along with rich descriptions and assessements of their instructional effectiveness. PRISMS also includes teacher-prepared annotations detailing classroom experiences with using the phenomenon or representation, suggested modifications to make the item more effective, and questions that can guide its instructional use.  The collection expects to be enriched over time by additional teacher input on the usefulness of the  resources. Both the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the NSF Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) are providing significant co-funding of this project in recognition of the value of this work in advancing the larger educational goals of MPS and EPSCoR.",
