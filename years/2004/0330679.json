 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support of a workshop intended to contribute to the development of a strategic plan for use of the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve.  Jasper Ridge has a history of combining a core of long-term research with a variety of short-term projects representing a broad range of disciplines and diverse community of researchers. Areas of research strength include: multi-disciplinary studies of global change; biological invasions; biogeochemistry; conservation biology; and landscape and community ecology. Increasing demand for research, education, and public outreach access have raised important questions about the balance and integration of efforts in all three areas.  Thus the University has convened a strategic planning committee to develop a plan for the Preserve.  As part of this effort, the workshop supported through this award will bring seven outside researchers and educators to the Preserve for discussion of the management challenges facing the Preserve in the coming years.  The participants,  researchers and field station managers of national or international stature, will produce a written report to the planning committee with an assessment of the adequacy of Preserve resources and recommendations for improvements in Preserve management and policy.\r\n",
