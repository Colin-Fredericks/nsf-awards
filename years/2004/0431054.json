 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports an international workshop to be held in Reykjavik, Iceland to bring researchers and ecosystem managers together to consider and plan the next steps in North Atlantic ocean-basin scale analysis, integration, synthesis, and modeling of biological, chemical, and physical oceanographic data sets.  Intellectual Merit:  This workshop is intended to lay the foundation for the integration and synthesis of data resulting from major oceanographic research programs, including GLOBEC programs in the USA, Canada, UK, and EU-funded programs, including TASC, ICOS, and others. The workshop will provide a forum for discussion of an action plan that will describe steps leading to new knowledge of the processes controlling dynamics of ocean-basin populations of zooplankton and fish and the input needed to improve management of fisheries resources. One expectation is that a critical element in the plan will be the development of conceptual and quantitative models capable of elucidating ecosystem dynamics and responses on a broad range of space and time scales. Our goal is to build upon previous and ongoing research in the North Atlantic, integrating and synthesizing the results of these programs, thus elucidating the mechanisms that link zooplankton, fish, and the environment at ocean basin scales.  Broader Impacts:  The workshop will encourage and promote trans-Atlantic exchange, collaboration, and team building between scientific investigators and ecosystem/fisheries managers. The workshop results will be distributed through a technical report of the workshop proceedings, and articles published in venues such as the GLOBEC International Newsletter, the IGBP newsletter, and EOS.",
