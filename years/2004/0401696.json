 "awd_abstract_narration": "Freiman's Theorem says that given a set A, if the sum\r\nset (i.e. the set of sums of two elements in A) is not too big,\r\nthen A can be included in the homomorphic\r\nimage in the set of integers of a d-dimensional box with integer\r\ncoordinates. We propose\r\nto sharpen our bound on the size of the box. We would also like \r\nto improve our\r\nresults on some conjectures made by Erdos and Szemeredi\r\nin combinatorial number theory,\r\nwhich says that the sum set and product set cannot both be small.\r\nWe would like to generalize some of the results to h-fold sum or\r\nproduct and sum-product problems along graphs.\r\nThe importance of these and similar issues became more\r\napparent in recent years because of their relation to issues in\r\ncomputer science and harmonic analysis. Important contributions\r\nalong this line were made by Fefferman and Gowers. \r\n\r\nOne of the features of several current developments in mathematics\r\nand applied mathematics is the emergence of issues with a\r\ncombinatorial flavor, sometimes in seemingly unrelated questions.\r\nSome of these issues turned out to have already been studied in\r\nearlier days with different motivations. Well-known examples of\r\nthis phenomenon is the revitalization of mathematical topics such\r\nas graph theory and computational algebra under impetus of\r\ncomputer science, in particular complexity theory and the theory\r\nof algorithms. My work in combinatorial number theory has this\r\nfeature. But besides an interest from part of the computer science\r\ncommunity, it does primarily belong to an active research\r\ndirection in harmonic analysis and differential equations.\r\n",
