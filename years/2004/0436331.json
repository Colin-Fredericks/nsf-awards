 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the Third Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets-III), being held in San Diego, California on 15-16 October 2004, is to bring together researchers in the networking and distributed systems community to debate emerging research directions.  This workshop promotes community-wide discussion of ideas that are not yet mature, with the expectations that (1) this will influence and foster ongoing research in the community, and (2) many of the HotNets position papers will grow into papers accepted at SIGCOMM or other quality conferences.  This grant provides funding to assist 10 US-based graduate students in attending this meeting.  Participation in workshops like this is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field.  The support provided enables the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend HotNets-III.\r\n",
