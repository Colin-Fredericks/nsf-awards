 "awd_abstract_narration": "The precise measurement of atmospheric oxygen was pioneered by the PI.  Records of changes in atmospheric oxygen along with carbon dioxide levels have been documented for nearly 15 years at a number of sites throughout the globe using flask sampling of air.  These data are extremely useful in documenting and quantifying sources and sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide, and their evolution with time.  In particular, sinks of carbon over land and ocean can be constrained, the response of ocean biogeochemistry to climate change quantified, and climatologies of air-sea heat exchange tested.\r\n\r\nThis work is continued in the present investigation, with the addition of activities designed to improve the quality of the data, including addition of a measurement site at Ascension Island, equatorial ship board measurements, improvements to the gas handling procedures and equipment, harmonization of standards, data management activities, and coordination with the group at Princeton who make similar measurements.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this work include contribution to the goals of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and thus to national and international policy on climate.  These data will be of great use in modeling studies to assess the understanding of various carbon related processes.  In addition, there exists significant potential for unexpected global phenomena of societal relevance.  Technology for making climate relevant observations will be advanced and made available to the scientific community through publications and the training of students.",
