He will visit with Professor Zhongqin Lin and others at the School of Mechanical Engineering of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Shanghai, China, and also Professor Sheng-Jye Jim Hwang of the Mechanical Engineering Department of National Cheng Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan.  These investigators intend to develop cooperative research and educational activities focused on the processes of grinding and slicing semiconductor wafers, micro electrical discharge machining (EDM) and nano-scale spark erosion.  \r\n\r\nScientific Merit\r\n\r\nPrecision manufacturing, including new techniques involving nanotechnology, has experienced rapid growth with the demand for increasingly complex and miniaturized electronics in industries and products ranging from aerospace to medical implants to audio-visual equipment. Imaginative fundamental research and constantly updating education and training are necessary to continue improving the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of manufacturing techniques.  The explosive growth of electronic manufacturing in East Asia has made this region a highly attractive and worthwhile source of partners for leading-edge research and development.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\nThe number of innovative products to improve human welfare that can already be attributed to increasingly precise manufacturing processes attest to the value of this area of research to the general public. The amazing results of semiconductor miniaturization can be seen in communication devices, medical implants, laparoscopic surgery, home electronics, and many other areas of everyday life. \r\n\r\nine to aud ranging from minitu techniques, have made this collaboration and planning trip essential.   \r\nShanghai Jiao Tong University, the National Cheng Kong University,\r\n  Hosts of the visits are Their  endorsement letters are included in this proposal.  This planning visit is expected to take 15 days: 10 days in China, 3 days in Taiwan, and 2 traveling days.  The estimated budget is $4,400. \r\n\r\n",
