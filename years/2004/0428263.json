 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research that leads to a clear path for the development of low cost, fast, rugged, and extremely sensitive sensors for real-time monitoring is of high demand to homeland security. The goal of this research proposal is to develop sensitive and selective microsensors for continuous monitoring of organophosphorus compounds by using multilayer modified microcantilevers. The general concept and methods developed here will also find applications in environment, food safety, clinical diagnostic, and industry. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: Microcantilevers have proven to be an outstanding sensor platform for extremely sensitive chemical and biological sensors. So far, three approaches have been used to immobilize the molecular recognition agents to the microcantilever surface: polymer films, self-assembled monolayers, and surface conjugation chemistry. It is anticipated that the Layer-by-layer multilayer technique can overcome many drawbacks from these methods. The multilayer modification is easy to operate, reliable, and will offer stronger bending amplitude. The PI proposes to develop and interpret the mechanism of enzyme reaction-induced microcantilever bendings. This will help to predict cantilever bending responses when other enzymes are used. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: An educational program in MEMs Sensors will serve to instruct scientists and engineers in applications of MEMs in chemistry and biology. The project will also benefit students in our new MS program in \"Molecular Sciences and Nanotechnology\", which may be the first graduate degree in the nanotechnology area in the country. Through research and learning, students will be more aware of the role of science and technology in homeland security. Louisiana Tech maintains close tires with the neighboring Grambling State University, a well-known HBCU institution. The project is expected to have a broad and lasting impact on the education and training of the next generation of scientist and engineers as well as increasing the number of under-represented minorities and women in science and technology.\r\n",
