 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ClassAction project is developing a model for interactive classroom materials for formative assessment and rapid student feedback in introductory college science courses.  Taking the form of carefully crafted multiple-choice questions in electronic databases, the formative assessment items are specifically designed for student voting that promote collaborative discussion.   Based on student misconceptions research, they are designed to allow rapid and reliable formative assessment of student learning in large classrooms equipped with electronic personal response systems.  The questions are illustrated visually with animations and simulations and are dynamic in that instructors can easily transform them into alternative representations.  Considerable background instructional resources are included in each module to allow instructors to provide feedback.   \r\n\r\nInitially set in the context of introductory astronomy for non-science majors, the questions target common student misconceptions that have proven difficult to overturn.  The materials are designed using a learning cycle approach to encourage students to elicit, confront, and resolve their misconceptions.  These efforts effectively balance research informed pedagogy and creativity.  The ClassAction project has considerable impact on the way in which formative assessment is used to improve astronomy instruction and the underlying design is easily transferable to other disciplines.   The database infrastructure and created materials are being widely disseminated throughout the science education community. \r\n",
