The goal is to identify and highlight new computational paradigms and information infrastructure issues to collect, process, analyze, integrate, model, synthesize, and simulate vast amounts of heterogeneous multi-modal, multi-scale data for emerging real-world life science applications, especially in the domains of systems biology, biomarker and drug development, environmental and public health.  The characteristics of the data involved in these scenarios includes: (1) large volume, (2) multiple modalities, (3) multiple biological scale, (4) heterogeneous, (5) often distributed, and (6) requiring systems biology and syndromic approaches. \r\n  \r\nA select group of forty leading experts and thought leaders in the fields of biology, engineering, and medical research will be invited to attend.  In addition, two well-known international experts in industry will give presentations and be engaged in workshop discussions.  The workshop committee will integrate and synthesize the discussion summaries into a publishable report, including the problem statements of the challenging and emerging multi-scale, multi-model life science applications and suggested research directions and program establishment to the relevant federal funding agencies.  This workshop will be held in the Lister Hill Auditorium of the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland.\r\n",
