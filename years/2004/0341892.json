The workshop will include discussion of clinical scenarios, technology requirements, training needs of health care professionals, and technology integration issues. A report on the \"Integrated Operating Room of the Year 2020\" will be the workshop deliverable and will be made available over the Internet and in printed form.  The workshop will be small, highly interactive, focused, carefully structured, and with ample time to promote discussion. All of the participants will stay at the workshop site and group meals will be provided to encourage interaction and a free exchange of ideas. Through breakout sessions, needs will be identified and an action plan for their adaptation and development will be produced. The summaries, needs assessments, and action plan will be made available in a format that can be distributed to researchers holding potential solutions through new technologies.   \r\n\r\nThis workshop will lay the groundwork for the integrated operating room of the future and will produce a prioritized list of research areas. The workshop report will serve as a blueprint to catalyze future research in this area, which could ultimately lead to improved patient care. The results will be disseminated broadly through the workshop report and publication on the Internet. The workshop will also promote collaborative research by bringing together engineers, scientists, and clinicians from different universities and medical centers.\r\n",
