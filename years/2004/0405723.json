 "awd_abstract_narration": "Associated with an invariant subvariety of a representation we \r\nconsider its cohomology class in equivariant cohomology, and call it \r\nthe Thom polynomial of the variety (``singularity''). Thus, the Thom \r\npolynomial is a G-equivariant characteristic class. Tracing back the \r\ndefinition of equivariant cohomology we obtain that the knowledge of \r\nthe Thom polynomial of singularities reduces global singularity \r\ntheoretic problems to homotopy theory (namely, to the computation of \r\nthe characteristic classes of the underlying topological situation). \r\nThom polynomials compute the cohomology class of the locus in a \r\nparameter space over which an object (map germ, differential form, \r\narrangement, a bundle, a digaram of linear maps, etc) degenerates.  A \r\npromising direction is the search for the corresponding good notion in \r\nextraordinary cohomology theories, the computation of these \r\nextraordinary Thom polynomials and finding topological applications. \r\nAnother important direction is working out global singularity\r\ntheory of geometrically or physically relevant representations, such as\r\nDynkin quiver representations, surface bundles, multisingualrity loci \r\nover the complex and the real numbers, hyperplane arrangements, as \r\nwell as their connections to degree, resultant and discriminant \r\nformulas. In many of these cases one expects different positivity \r\nproperties of the Thom polynomials, which can contribute to the newly \r\nemerging bridge between geometry and combinatorics. The third goal is \r\nto explore the indirect usage of Thom polynomials in Geometric \r\nInvariant Theory. Here Thom polynomials can compute various non-\r\nstability loci of representations, hence they give natural, \r\ngeometrically defined relations in the cohomology ring of the G.I.T. \r\nquotients.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn various geometric and topological situations singularities occur\r\nfor global reasons. That is, the global topology of a space, a \r\nmanifold, a variety or a map forces some singularities to occur. (A \r\ntrivial example is the global topology of the Klein bottle which \r\nforces double points when mapped into 3-space.) This global behaviour \r\nof singularities is governed by their Thom polynomials. If we \r\nsubstitute global topological invariants into the Thom polynomial we \r\nobtain the number of singularities forced by topology. This general \r\npoint of view contains several mathematical areas as special cases, \r\namong others ``degeneracy loci formulas'' of algebraic geometry,\r\nimmersion and general multiple point formulas of differentaial \r\ntopology, and the theory of Schur, Schubert and quiver polynomials of \r\nalgebraic combinatorics. Thom polynomials, however, are notoriously \r\nhard to compute. Although some powerful methods are known, some by the \r\nauthor, no universal method has beed found. We propose to study the \r\nbasics of Thom polynomial theory, including possible generalizations \r\nto other cohomology theories. Another challenge is the understanding \r\nof the interior structure of natural infinite series of Thom \r\npolynomials. This direction promises to establish connections between \r\nthe different areas that play roles in different computational \r\napproaches, e.g. algebraic topology, symmetric functions, \r\ninterpolation theory, localizations, Groebner basis theory.\r\nAnother main goal is to find applications of computed Thom polynomials\r\nin topology, geometry and invariant theory.\r\n",
