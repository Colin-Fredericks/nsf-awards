Smith\r\n\r\nThis multi-campus team is studying processes within a single\r\nbiological host that can be described by models inspired by ecological\r\nstoichiometry, the study of the balance of energy and multiple\r\nchemical resources (usually elements) in ecological\r\ninteractions. These concepts have been broadened by their extension to\r\nbiological stoichiometry, which has proven to be an important new lens\r\nthrough which we can view and understand complex biological\r\ninteractions. Within this general theory, the cycling and utilization\r\nof energy and multiple nutrients by organisms and their constituent\r\ncells occupies a central position. With its emphasis on the flow of\r\nelemental matter, such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus,\r\nstoichiometric theory covers multiple biological scales. It also\r\nallows, via rigid physical and chemical constraints, the construction\r\nof robust mechanistic and predictive models. Originally formulated and\r\nverified in the fields of limnology and plant ecology, biological\r\nstoichiometry has recently been applied at physiological scales to\r\nsuch diverse areas as organism development and tumor growth. In this\r\nproposal we aim to synthesize and apply theoretical and empirical\r\napproaches to biological stoichiometry within the grand framework of\r\ninternal disease.  Recent headline-grabbing findings that connect\r\nnutritional factors to disease dynamics indicate there is an\r\nincreasing need for stoichiometry-based mathematical models of\r\ninternal disease that track the effects of potentially limiting\r\nresources.  The proposed work weaves together threads of theoretical\r\nand experimental research. Our primary aim is the construction of\r\npredictive and verifiable theoretical models which can begin to\r\nexplicitly deal with the effects of stoichiometric interactions in\r\nwithin-host disease dynamics. Such models will be built in a modular\r\nfashion, starting with simple deterministic models, and then\r\nprogressively adding stochasticity, spatial heterogeneity, and\r\ngenetics. At each step the models will be challenged, calibrated, and\r\ntested by in vitro laboratory experiments.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work will have a broad impact in both science research\r\nand education, and eventually in internal disease management and\r\ntreatment. Regarding the former, our research team is truly\r\ninterdisciplinary, with group members in mathematics, theoretical\r\nphysics, ecology, and biomedicine. Our collaborative efforts will\r\nprovide undergraduate and graduate students and junior scientists of\r\ndiverse ethnic/racial backgrounds with first-hand educational\r\nexperience in cross-disciplinary communication and exploration.  The\r\ncurrent proposal is a step towards new ways to understand disease,\r\naiming to develop robust and experimentally calibrated mathematical\r\ntheories of disease-host interactions that can be applied to a wide\r\nvariety of diseases. We firmly believe that such theories have a\r\ncentral role to play in present and future research. These grants for\r\nproposals submitted as a collaborative proposal from three\r\ninstitutions are made under the Joint DMS/NIGMS Initiative to Support\r\nResearch Grants in the Area of Mathematical Biology.  This is a joint\r\ncompetition sponsored by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the\r\nDirectorate for Biological Sciences at the National Science Foundation\r\nand the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) at the\r\nNational Institutes of Health.\r\n",
