 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is devoted to diffeomorphisms  groups of manifolds of the\r\ndimension 2 and 3. In the dimension 2 the main problem is to understand the\r\nalgebraic structure of the groups of isotopy classes of such\r\ndiffeomorphisms, known as mapping class groups of surfaces or Teichmueller\r\nmodular groups. The proposal addresses some of the central problems about\r\nthe mapping class groups: understanding the structure of the Torelli groups,\r\nbraid groups of surfaces, and mapping class groups themselves. The problems\r\naddressed in the proposal are\r\nthe ones which either hold the key for the fundamental properties\r\nof the groups in question (like the problem of finite presentability of the\r\nTorelli groups) or have connections with other branches of mathematics (like\r\nthe problem of understanding the Wajnryb presentations from the point of\r\nview of algebraic K-theory and topological quantum field theory). In the\r\ndimension 3 the key problem is the understanding of the homotopy type of the\r\ndiffeomorphisms groups, especially of their connected components. The main\r\ngoal here is to relate the few available results in this area to the more\r\nmainstream tools of topology and to extend, on this basis, these results to\r\nother manifolds. A particular goal is to understand the diffeomorphisms\r\ngroups for all lens spaces, the simplest 3-manifolds after spheres.\r\n\r\nThe proposal belongs to the field of low dimensional topology, which\r\ninvestigates the possible shapes of objects (namely, the so-called\r\nmanifolds) in dimension 2 and 3. These shapes continue to be in the focus of\r\nthe mathematical research for more than a hundred years. In the last\r\ndecades, the theory of 2-dimensional shapes, i.e. surfaces, acquired an\r\nadditional significance as a result of a promising physical \"theory of\r\neverything \", namely the so-called string theory. In this theory, the\r\nelementary constituents of matter are not point-like particles, but rather\r\ncollections of loops (\"strings\") sweeping a surface during their motion. The\r\n3-dimensional shapes provide the model for the large-scale structure of the\r\nuniverse. Some previous results of the PI in this direction have already\r\nattracted the attention of physicists working in general relativity. In both\r\ndimensions, 2 and 3, one of the key problem is to understand the possible\r\nsymmetries of these shapes. The proposal is devoted to some of the main\r\naspects of this problem.\r\n\r\n",
