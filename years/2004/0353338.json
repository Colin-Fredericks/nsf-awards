International congresses provide a forum for researchers from around the world to present and discuss recent research findings and to define directions for future research work.  They provide a setting for exchanging ideas, cultivating working relationships, building networks, and educating graduate students.  Attendees are exposed to the latest developments in theoretical and applied mechanics, interact with leaders and pioneers in the field, strengthen their understanding of basic principles, and establish a more personal relationship with their peers.  The increased involvement of all researchers, both junior and senior, from the United States that this grant will enable will strengthen U.S. mechanics research and help build the future of the discipline.\r\n\r\n",
