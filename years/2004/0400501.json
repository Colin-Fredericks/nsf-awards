 "awd_abstract_narration": "In magnetoelectronics the spin of the charge carriers is exploited. In molecular electronics the circuits possess precision at the atomic level. We aim to integrate these two fields by fabricating heterostructure devices that will integrate half-metals (such as manganites) with single wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). The ferromagnetic manganites are a particularly effective source of spin-polarized electrons (polarization?100%). Carbon nanotubes display exotic properties (Kondo physics, Luttinger liquid behavior and superconducting fluctuations) that we will explore and exploit with spin polarized injection. Significantly, spin-injection will be across nanoscale interfaces. Therefore device performance could far exceed the performance of planar tunnel junctions in which the interfaces are imperfect and span several microns.\r\n\r\nThe scientific merit of the proposed work arises firstly from its materials science impact. The in-situ growth of SWNT architectures has yet to be achieved. Secondly, the use of SWNTs as the non-ferromagnetic layer in the architecture offers intriguing possibilities arising from the fact  that the SWNT-magnetic interface is brought down to molecular dimensions. This  combined  with  the  intrinsic  one-dimensionality  and  extremely  long  elastic-  and  phase- scattering  lengths  of  SWNTs  allows  progress  towards  a  new  generation  of  molecular-scale  functional devices. The broader impact of this proposal is in the training and mentoring of graduate students, in particular minority and women students, to be future professionals. Another key is the continuing collaboration between NJIT and Rutgers, two public institutions with high (over 40%) percentage of underrepresented minority students. The continuing collaboration will provide more opportunities for training larger number of undergraduate and graduate students at both institutions and sharing of resources.\r\n",
