 "awd_abstract_narration": "We propose a program of polarized electron scattering experiments, to use the weak neutral\r\ncurrent and electromagnetic probes to study the flavor content and spin structure of the nucleon,\r\nand to conduct a search for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The experiments will be\r\nconducted primarily at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab).\r\nA series of experiments using parity violation in electron scattering at Jefferson Lab are\r\nfocused on determining the elusive strange quark contribution to the nucleon ground state. These\r\nexperiments include measurements in Hall A of the parity-violating asymmetry in forward-angle\r\nscattering from the proton, 4-He, and 208-Pb, at low momentum transfer. The G0 experiment in\r\nHall C will measure parity-violating scattering from the proton at both forward and backward\r\nangles, and for a range of momentum transfers, and thus will definitively map out the strange\r\nquark vector form factors for the nucleon as a function of four-momentum transfer.\r\nA groundbreaking experiment has recently been approved at Jefferson Laboratory to\r\nmeasure the weak charge of the proton. The Qweak experiment will provide a precision test of\r\nthe energy scale dependence of the weak mixing angle by precisely measuring the Weinberg\r\nangle at low momentum transfer and comparing to data from high-energy experiments. This will\r\nprovide a uniquely sensitive probe of physics beyond the Standard Model. We are thus\r\naddressing possibly the single most important question in fundamental physics: how and where\r\ndoes the Standard Model break down? We have taken on an important component of the Qweak\r\nexperiment, the Region III tracking chambers, the construction of which has been recently\r\nfunded by an NSF Major Research Instrumentation grant.\r\nAnother series of polarized electron scattering experiments at Jefferson Lab are focused\r\non determining the spin structure of the nucleon using polarized 3-He targets. The GEN\r\nexperiment will make the first measurement on the neutron electric form factor at large\r\nmomentum transfers. This is particularly relevant given the recent controversial results for the\r\nelectric form factor of the proton and new theoretical work on two-photon exchange\r\nmechanisms. In support of this program, research into promising new technology involving\r\nhybrid K-Rb cells is underway in the W&M polarized target lab.\r\nThis physics program has a large educational component; eleven PhD graduate students\r\nare working on group-related activities, and support is requested from the NSF for five of these\r\nstudents. Each year we supervise an average of seven undergraduates in summer or senior-thesis\r\nresearch. Support for 1.5 post-doctoral positions is also requested from the NSF. The proximity\r\nof our group to Jefferson Lab, its strong ties to Jefferson Lab through affiliated faculty, and its\r\nability to attract excellent William and Mary undergraduate students, ensure the success of the\r\nproposed research.",
