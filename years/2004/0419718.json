 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of using high intensity resonant vibrational energy as the basis for developing an efficient, scalable mixer for solid-solid and liquid-solid powder processing applications. Conventional powder mixers are ineffective when mixing very small particles or when loading particles into viscous liquids. Currently available mixers cannot reach the level of homogeneity that industry demands. Vibratory mixers have the capacity to meet these mixing demands, but the existing technology is limited in intensity and has not been shown to be scalable. This project will extend this technology to particle mixing applications required for the powder processing industry. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts from this technology could enhance the scientific understanding of solid-solid and liquid-solid mixing in a high intensity resonant vibrational field. More generally, the results will have scientific merit that can be extended to other complex, nonlinear dynamic systems. The resulting technological benefits will allow on site mixing and color blending in addition to custom formulation of nanocomposite coatings. By enabling more powder processing applications, new high performance materials will be realized. Replacing conventional coating techniques with powder coating applications will reduce VOC emissions substantially. This technology could enhance the durability of maintenance type coatings, which in turn will gain in popularity due to improved quality and functionality. The initial commercial targets of this technology will be the polymer powder coating and particle-loaded polymer industries.\r\n",
