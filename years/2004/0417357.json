 "awd_abstract_narration": "A high-resolution, physical map of the soybean cv. Williams 82 genome is currently under construction. However, this effort is hampered by the size, complexity, and limited knowledge of the structure of the soybean genome. This Small Grant for Exploratory Research project will address the urgent need for BAC-end sequences and a public repeat sequence database to aid in map assembly and annotation. The sequence resources to be developed will provide a better estimate of the gene and repeat content of the soybean genome.  The BAC-end sequences will be integrated into the physical map, as well as used to anchor genes and genetic markers.\r\n\r\nThe specific goals of the project are to 1] generate a repeat sequence database by single-pass sequencing of 25,000 randomly generated plasmid clones, 2] sequence 20,000 BAC-ends, 3] annotate the sequence, and 4] incorporate the data into the Fingerprint Contig (FPC) database for community access (http://www.genome.arizona.edu/).  Sequence data will be released to the GSS division of GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbGSS/) on a weekly basis.\r\n\r\nA robust map of the soybean genome will facilitate the development of a wide range of functional genomics tools for soybean. An additional outcome will be the recruitment of young scientists who will see soybean as an exciting research system on which they can build their careers. This increase in critical mass will have many tangible benefits, including preserving the viability of soybean as an agriculture crop and contributing to homeland security by insuring a safe and available food supply. \r\n",
