 "awd_abstract_narration": "In collaboration with Motorola and Freescale Semiconductor, we propose the fabrication and study of novel nanostructures based on highly organized, three-dimensional arrays of size and shape controlled silicon nanocrystals (NCs). These three-dimensional nanostructures will be prepared in the form of pyramid-dot complexes where nearly spherical Si NCs (i.e., quantum dots) will be placed directly on top of laterally ordered Si pyramids. Using this technique, we intend to exploit these novel structures in new memory devices. These devices utilize resonant carrier injection from nanoscale Si pyramids via discrete energy levels of nanometer diameter Si quantum dots. The exciting but challenging goals of this project are:\r\n\r\n(i)\tDevelopment of a nanofabrication technique focused on highly ordered three-\tdimensional network of Si NC pyramid-dot complexes.\r\n\r\n(ii)\tExperimental studies and theoretical modeling of resonant carrier injection in a system of coupled pyramid-dot Si NCs.\r\n\r\n(iii) \tFabrication and testing of ultra-fast, non-volatile memory device prototypes based on Si NC pyramid/dot complexes. \r\n\r\n\tBy achieving these goals, we will constitute fundamental advances in faster Si NC-based non-volatile memories and novel circuit functionalities.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\n\r\n  \tThe integration of research and education in this proposal will be done (i) via integrating the proposed research advances into the undergraduate and graduate NJIT curriculum, and (ii) by offering outreach programs to pre-college students and school teachers in our local area. For the youngest students, our new project at NJIT will reach out to the local K-12 community with state-of-the art laboratory tours and mentoring high school teacher summer classes with focus on modern electronic devices and circuits. With its ethnically diverse student body and urban location, NJIT has a unique opportunity to pursue groups historically under-represented in science and engineering.\r\n",
