Harrold (Georgia Tech.), submitted by the Computing Research Association (CRA)\r\nTitle: CRA's Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Special Project award to the Computing Research Association's Committee on the status of women (CRA-W) will provide support to CRA-W to expand and enhance its activities. Funding is provided to maintain the CRA-W committee and to support new initiative's such as the long-term tracking of graduate student cohorts, career mentoring mini-workshops, a reunion of former participants of CRA-W's programs for undergraduate research mentoring, new projects for women researchers in industrial labs, joint efforts with the Coalition to Diversifying Computing, a service called Friends of CRA-W to help principal investigators implement meaningful diversity plans, and a leadership summit for senior women.\r\n\r\nThe Computing Research Association's Committee on the status of women (CRA-W) has been a national leader since 1991 in positive efforts to increase the number and success of women in Computer Science and Engineering (CS&E) research.  It is an action-based committee, implementing projects aimed at eliminating barriers to the full participation of women at all stages of the research pipeline.  CRA-W has had a significant impact on the Computer Science & Engineering (CS&E) community, directly impacting over 2000 women and indirectly influencing thousands of others.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in CRA-W facilitating a broad range of research activities in CS&E.  CRA-W's commitment to program evaluation will provides important data on what works and what doesn't work for others interested in starting similar programs.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this effort lies in CRA-W providing mentoring opportunities and community building to encourage women in CS&E research, and to increase the awareness of gender issues across the CS&E discipline. CRA-W programs address every rung of the ladder of higher education in CS&E.  The networks of women mentoring women that CRA-W builds across institutions serve an essential function in ameliorating their isolation.  CRA-W programs have a significant impact on institutions and their approach to including women in the research enterprise.\r\n",
