 "awd_abstract_narration": "Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are rubbers whose\r\nconstituent molecules are orientationally ordered, with their\r\nsalient feature being a strong coupling between the orientational\r\norder and mechanical strain.  A characteristic feature of LCEs is\r\nthat relatively small external effects, such as changes in\r\ntemperature or onset of illumination, can produce huge and rapid\r\ndeformations.  LCEs will likely assume real technological\r\nimportance due of their softness and their ready responsiveness\r\nto applied fields, yielding applications in microfluidic pumping\r\nand switching, and helping to answer basic questions in\r\nlocomotion.  By extending the theory of rubber networks, the\r\ninvestigators develop and explore continuum descriptions of these\r\nmaterials, and study how LCEs behave in the bulk and in\r\ninteraction with an external fluid, and begin to develop\r\nsimulational methods for these systems.  Parallel to the\r\ntheoretical study is an experimental program that involves the\r\napplications of LCEs, such as to locomotion, but also to new\r\nmaterials synthesis.\r\n\r\n     Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are active flexible\r\nmaterials whose constituent molecules can be reoriented or\r\ndisordered by applying electric or temperature fields.  A\r\nconsequence of this is that relatively small external effects,\r\nsay in temperature changes or an onset of illumination, can\r\nproduce huge and rapid deformations of the material. The\r\ninvestigators have already demonstrated that LCEs can have\r\nfascinating dynamics when interacting with a fluidic environment,\r\nsuch as the observed \"swimming\" of floating LCE samples away from\r\nan illuminated region.  These materials may be of technological\r\nimportance due of their softness and responsiveness, suggesting\r\napplications in microfluidic pumping and switching, and helping\r\nto answer basic questions in locomotion.  To fully exploit these\r\nmaterials the development of soundly based mathematical models is\r\ncrucial.  The investigators develop mathematical descriptions of\r\nthese materials, and seek to understand the ways in which LCEs\r\ninteract with applied fields and with their environment. \r\nParallel to the theoretical studies is an experimental program\r\nthat involves the applications of LCEs, such as to locomotion,\r\nbut also to new materials synthesis.\r\n",
