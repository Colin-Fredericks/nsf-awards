The Collaboration's methods explicitly model the\r\ncomplexities of both astronomical sources and the data generation\r\nmechanisms inherent in new high-tech instruments and fully utilize the\r\nresulting highly structured models in learning about the underlying\r\nastronomical and physical processes. Using these models requires\r\nsophisticated scientific computation, advanced methods for statistical\r\ninference, and careful model checking procedures. The PIs of the\r\nCollaboration (van Dyk and Meng) both have substantial research\r\nexperience in developing the methods that the Collaboration is\r\nextending, employing, and publicizing: inferential and efficient\r\ncomputational methods under highly-structured models that involve\r\nmultiple levels of latent variables and incomplete data.  Such models\r\nare ideally suited to account for the many physical and instrumental\r\nfilters that compose the data generation mechanism in high-energy\r\nastrophysics. The five consultants on the project (Chiang, Connors,\r\nKashyap, Karovska, and Siemiginowska) all have expertise on the\r\ninstrumentation and science of high-energy astrophysics, and, all have\r\ncollaborated with statisticians in efforts to develop appropriate\r\nmethods to address scientific questions. There are two primary impacts\r\nof this project: the impact of the development of more reliable\r\nstatistical methods on scientific findings in astronomy and the impact\r\nof the new statistical inference and computation methods in a wide\r\nrange of scientific fields. As the Collaboration develops methods and\r\ndistributes free software for specific inferential tasks, it also\r\neducates the astronomical community as to the benefit of careful use\r\nof sophisticated statistical methods. (The Collaboration organizes one\r\nor two special sessions at meetings of the American Astronomical\r\nSociety each year.) It is expected that a fundamental impact of the\r\nproposed research will be a more general acceptance and more prevalent\r\nuse of appropriate methods among astronomers. Second, the\r\nCollaboration is an example of a new mode of statistical\r\ninference. Rather than using off-the-shelf models and methods, it is\r\nbecoming ever more feasible to develop application specific models\r\nthat are designed to account for the particular complexities of a\r\nproblem at hand.  The Collaboration develops inferential and\r\ncomputational methods for handling such multi-level models. As\r\napplication specific multi-level models become more prevalent, these\r\nmethods will have application throughout the natural, social, and\r\nengineering sciences.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, there has been an explosion of new data in\r\nobservational high-energy astrophysics. Recently launched or\r\nsoon-to-be launched space-based telescopes that are designed to detect\r\nand map ultra-violet, X-ray, and gamma-ray electromagnetic emission\r\nare opening a whole new window to study the cosmos. Because the\r\nproduction of high-energy electromagnetic emission requires\r\ntemperatures of millions of degrees and is an indication of the\r\nrelease of vast quantities of stored energy, these instruments give a\r\ncompletely new perspective on the hot and turbulent regions of the\r\nuniverse. The new instrumentation allows for very high resolution\r\nimaging, spectral analysis, and time series analysis. The Chandra\r\nX-ray Observatory, for example, produces images at least thirty times\r\nsharper than any previous X-ray telescope.  The complexity of the\r\ninstruments, the complexity of the astronomical sources, and the\r\ncomplexity of the scientific questions leads to a subtle inference\r\nproblem that requires sophisticated statistical tools. For example,\r\ndata are subject to non-uniform censoring, errors in measurement, and\r\nbackground contamination. Astronomical sources exhibit complex and\r\nirregular spatial structure. Scientists wish to draw conclusions as to\r\nthe physical environment and structure of the source, the processes\r\nand laws which govern the birth and death of planets, stars, and\r\ngalaxies, and ultimately the structure and evolution of the\r\nuniverse. Nonetheless little effort has been made to bring the\r\nstrength of modern statistical methods to bare on these problems. The\r\nCalifornia-Harvard Astrostatistics Collaboration develops statistical\r\nmethods, computational techniques, and freely available software to\r\naddress outstanding inferential problems in high-energy astrophysics.\r\nThe methods developed are an example of a new mode of statistical\r\ninference: Rather than using off-the-shelf methods, it is becoming\r\never more feasible to develop methods that are application specific\r\nand are designed to account for the particular complexities of a\r\nproblem at hand. The inferential and computational methods designed by\r\nthe Collaboration for handling such multi-level models have\r\napplication throughout the natural, social, and engineering sciences.\r\n",
