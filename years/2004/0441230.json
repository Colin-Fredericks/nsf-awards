 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis proposal requests funds to help support meeting costs and travel expenses of U.S.\r\nparticipants to the 25th International Conference on Mathematical Geophysics to be held\r\nat Columbia University in New York City from June 16-18, 2004. The Conference on\r\nMathematical Geophysics meets every two years and is sponsored by the Committee on\r\nMathematical Geophysics of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merits This year's conference is titled Frontiers in Theoretical Earth Science\r\nand brings together earth scientists, physicists, applied mathematicians, and others who\r\nseek to develop new ideas for better understanding the processes and properties of the\r\nEarth. This year, the meeting will survey the current and future state of theoretical Earth\r\nsciences ranging from the core and mantle to the surface, oceans, and life. In particular\r\nthe meeting emphasizes advances in theory, techniques such as advanced computation and\r\ndata analysis and new problems and observations in need of theoretical understanding.\r\nThis meeting provides a single multi-disciplinary forum for the exchange of ideas and\r\ntechniques across the disciplinary boundaries in the Earth Sciences The conference web\r\nsite can be found at http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~mspieg/CMG2004/.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts This meeting provides a rare opportunity for students and early-career\r\nscientists from across the earth sciences and applied mathematics to interact with senior\r\nscientists in a small informal setting. This meeting also forms a principal activity of\r\nColumbia's NSF IGERT Joint Program in Applied Mathematics and Earth & Environ-mental\r\nSciences. It will be staffed by current IGERT graduate students and will provide\r\nexcellent exposure for these students to a wide range of research opportunities, new peers\r\nand senior scientists. Space permitting, the oral sessions of this meeting will be open to the\r\ngeneral public.\r\n",
