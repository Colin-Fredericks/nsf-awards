 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) is focused on environmentally friendly lubricants for cold forging processes based on polymeric formulation and the develop of methodology based on coupling tribochemistry with severity of deformation modes of specific forging processes. The new lubricant formulation concept is based on  combination of internally stabilized emulsion polymers along with advances in adhesion  chemistry and synthetic lubricants. This lubricant is aimed at replacing zinc phosphate coating. The effort will include development of a quick and robust online lubrication system for the newly formulated lubricants. \r\n \r\nIn recent years the U.S. forging industry has undergone significant shrinkage due to intense global competition, technological changes, and environmental and economic factors. Serious environmental concerns may cause the phase out of the current lubrication system for cold forging based on zinc phosphate coatings. This project, in cooperation with NC State University, targets an environmentally friendly lubricant to assist the forging industry.\r\n",
