 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is building an educational software engineering simulation environment, called SimSE, and is demonstrating how students benefit from using this simulation environment in gaining both a broad and deep understanding of the software development process.  This tool provides the missing process experience that is a key part of the gap between the skills taught in a typical software engineering course and the skills needed to successfully function in an industrial software development project.  SimSE addresses this gap by introducing students to many aspects of the software process in a virtual environment that fosters experimental, interactive, and independent learning.  SimSE addresses specific situations, such as inspections or integration testing, and overarching practices, such as the waterfall model or the spiral model.  This tackles issues that can be taught abstractly, but are difficult for students to practice and experience comprehensively in lectures or class projects.\r\n",
