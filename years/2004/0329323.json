 "awd_abstract_narration": "The gigabytes to terabytes of data now being produced by scientific and medical \r\napplications on a routine basis create a pressing demand for capable visualization \r\ntools. One of the key problems hindering the development of such tools is the \r\ngrowing disparity between the available system bandwidth and the total need of \r\ndata access during interactive rendering of these large data sets. Unfortunately, \r\nsuch scarcity of physical bandwidth persists in spite of repeated efforts to \r\naccelerate I/O subsystems. Complementary to those continued efforts in increasing \r\nI/O performance, this project focuses on intelligently decreasing the need of \r\ndata access using a unique, coarse-grained method of visibility culling. \r\n\r\nVisibility culling aims at eliminating unnecessary visualization computation by \r\nfocusing on parts of the data that are visible from a specific view, culling \r\noccluded portions, which may be substantial, in the early stages of the \r\nvisualization pipeline. Although visibility culling has previously been done as \r\na by-product of the rendering process, it has yet to be explored as an independent \r\ntechnique for attacking the bandwidth bottleneck. For that purpose, the project we \r\npropose here will focus on the discovery and development of new visibility culling \r\nalgorithms that are generic, scalable and efficient. Our key concept is to encode \r\nmeta-opacity via precomputation. In any volume each voxel has a predetermined \r\nvalue of opacity. During rendering, a sequence of voxels is composited in depth \r\norder to form a view-dependent opacity value, called meta-opacity, for each ray \r\nsegment. We hypothesize that there exists a way to conservatively and efficiently \r\nencode meta-opacity of a convex-shaped volume block for a range of views under a \r\nfamily of transfer functions via a one-time pre-computation. We call such encoding \r\nthe Plenoptic Opacity Function (POF). Using POF for conservative run-time opacity \r\nestimation, great accelerations by visibility culling in volume rendering can be \r\naccomplished while the transfer function can be modified within the same family on \r\nthe fly. Here we test this hypothesis and apply POF to volume rendering in \r\nlarge-scale parallelism, as well as out-of-core visualization.\r\n\r\n",
