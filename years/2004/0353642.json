 "awd_abstract_narration": "The REU Pipeline for Undergraduate Student Horizons (PUSH) program at Northern New Mexico Community College (NNMCC) provides unparalleled research experiences in biotechnology and biological sciences for NNMCC students at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). NNMCC students are selected for the PUSH program following a competitive application and interview process and then matched with Bioscientists at LANL based on compatible interests and requisite skills. Through the PUSH program, students become active participants in yearlong specific research projects designed to expose participants to a wide variety of concepts and research approaches. Students are engaged in research and scientific activities at LANL for up to 20 hours per week during the academic year and full time during the summer. Program participants are provided with stipend, travel and research support.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the laboratory activities, students participate in weekly journal club meetings and monthly research-in-progress meetings.  Participants are also afforded the opportunity to attend weekly seminars by invited researchers and resident Bioscience staff.  Near the end of each semester PUSH students make formal presentations at sponsored research colloquia held at the NNMCC campus. At the end of the year, PUSH students present their research at the LANL-sponsored Student Symposium.  Such activities foster development of student cohorts at both the LANL and campus site and help to promote PUSH students as examples for peer undergraduates and other community students.   \r\n\r\nThe PUSH program allows NNMCC students to gain the experience and confidence needed to pursue technical jobs and pursue baccalaureate and advanced degrees for potential careers in science.   For further information contact Anthony Sena (apsena@nnmcc.edu) or Tracy Ruscetti (Ruscetti@lanl.gov).\r\n",
