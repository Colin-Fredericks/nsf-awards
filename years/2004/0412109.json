 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geoffrey D. Bothun, North Carolina A & T, is a Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellow for the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 academic years. Bothun will pursue his research interests in membrane-based supercritical fluid separations. He will also design undergraduate research projects integrated with the \"Center for Environmentally Responsible Solvents and Processes\", an NSF-funded Science and Technology Center based at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. With these projects, he will initiate and manage a \"cascading mentorship program\" aimed at promoting undergraduate research and enhancing the number of NC A&T students pursing post-graduate degrees. This Discovery Corps Postdoctoral Fellowship is supported by the Division of Chemistry, the Division of Chemical Transport Systems and the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities.\r\n\r\nThe Discovery Corps Fellowship Program is a pilot program seeking new postdoctoral and professional development models that combine research expertise with professional service.  Discovery Corps Fellows leverage their research expertise through projects that address areas of national need.  Their projects enhance research capacity and infrastructure and contribute to workforce development and job creation.  The Discovery Corps Program supports both Postdoctoral Fellows and Senior Fellows.\r\n",
