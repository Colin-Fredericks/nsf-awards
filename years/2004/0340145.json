 "awd_abstract_narration": "0340145\r\n\r\nThis Small  Business  Innovation  Research Phase  I  project  will  explore  the  feasibility  of \r\ndeveloping an  absolute, high-resolution linear encoder leveraging the evolving \r\ntechnology of spintronics.  An array of magnetic tunnel junction sensors will sense \r\nspatially  varying  magnetic  fields  generated  by  lithographically  defined  micron-scale \r\ncurrent carrying conductors with known geometries.  Absolute spatial encoding will be \r\nachieved by a unique  mapping of sensor outputs to linear displacement.  The proposed device will be \r\nan absolute encoder, which will dramatically reduce power consumption.  In the Phase I \r\nwork, this idea of a magnetic encoder based  on tunnel junction technology will be \r\nbrought from a purely theoretical idea to the prototyping stage.\r\n\r\nThe proposed product will be low-cost, low power, robust, and extremely sensitive compared to existing techniques and thus may create brand new markets for encoder technology.  The potential impact of the proposed work will thus be felt in every field requiring precise measurement of displacement, such as personal electronics, robotics, machine tools, wafer handling equipment, scientific and medical imaging, micromanipulation, and motion control systems.  The development of an array of magnetic tunnel junctions with submicron resolution will be of great utility in many fields of basic and applied research, particularly in the emerging fields of nanotechnology, biomagnetism, and spintronics.",
