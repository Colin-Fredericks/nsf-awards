Chang\r\n\r\nThe main projects funded by this award explore the existence\r\nproblem for Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature on\r\nnoncompact manifolds.  The work of Gromov and Lawson on the\r\ncompact case of this problem has stimulated important parts of\r\nthe development of noncommutative geometry and controlled\r\ntopology and these projects are formulated within the context of\r\nthe stable Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture.  The principal\r\ninvestigator and collaborators aim to construct an appropriate\r\nassembly map in the noncompact case, to test that theory in\r\nnatural examples, and to study with the generalized Roe algebra\r\nthe coarse quasi-isometry type of manifolds that do admit\r\ncomplete metrics of positive scalar curvature.  Noncompact\r\nmanifolds obtained by deleting submanifolds from larger compact\r\nmanifolds and non-Galois or irregular covering spaces of compact\r\nmanifolds are promising sources of examples for study, and\r\nnoncompact manifolds of finite asymptotic dimension will receive\r\nparticular attention.  Other directions of investigation include\r\nthe zero-in-the-spectrum conjecture and expander graphs.\r\n\r\nNoncommutative geometry is an approach to the study of geometric\r\nobjects through algebras of natural functions and operators.  For\r\nexample, much of the geometry of a sphere is captured in\r\nsolutions to equations that model vibration, and by the\r\ndifferential operators that appear in those equations.  Round\r\nspheres are examples of manifolds of positive curvature, the flat\r\nplane has curvature zero, and the saddle point in a mountain pass\r\nis a model for space of negative curvature.  Mathematicians have\r\nfound a number of tests that must be passed by any space that\r\nwould be a candidate to carry a geometry of positive curvature,\r\nand these projects will advance that effort.  Another line of\r\nwork described in the proposal concerns expander graphs, which\r\nwere originally introduced in computer science as models of large\r\nnetworks with good communication properties but have also turned\r\nout to be a source of potential counterexamples for geometric\r\nquestions.  These will be the subject of seminars involving\r\nstudents and faculty from Wellesley College and nearby\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n",
