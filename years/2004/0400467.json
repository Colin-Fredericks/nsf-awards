 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis is a mathematical research project on core models and their fine\r\nstructure, which is a subfield of set theory that was pioneered by Jensen.\r\nCore models are generalizations of Goedel's constructible universe, L,\r\nthat arose in the the study of large cardinal axioms. The field today\r\nbuilds on the fundamental discoveries of Dodd, Jensen, Martin, Mitchell,\r\nSteel and Woodin. The project is on pure core model theory as well as its\r\ninteractions with other areas, such as descriptive set theory and\r\ninfinitary combinatorics. Several of the research problems are on\r\ncombinatorial principles such as Diamond and Square, which were isolated\r\nby Jensen in his work on L. They are among the most commonly used tools in\r\nset theoretic constructions and have applications in neighboring fields\r\nsuch as model theory and topology.  Other research problems have their\r\norigins outside of core model theory. These include open questions about\r\ndescriptive set theory, forcing, singular cardinal combinatorics and\r\ncardinal invariants.\r\n\r\nThe axioms of set theory are the foundation of mathematics. Core model\r\ntheory addresses some of the most fundamental questions in set theory in\r\ndirect and highly sophisticated ways. Ideas are constantly exchanged\r\nbetween core model theory and other parts of set theory.  The research\r\nproblems to be addressed in this project are central in these respects.  \r\nSome ask for further development of the basic tools of core model theory,\r\nwhile others are about applications to neighboring fields.\r\n",
