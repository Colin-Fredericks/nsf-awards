Foster\r\nUniversity of Maryland - College Park\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to develop tools and techniques for improving the quality of software, with a focus on methods that analyze source code.  There are two main objectives.  The first is to develop the equivalent of type systems for high-level designs in software.  Currently, even with careful planning it is all too easy to\r\naccidentally violate design invariants as software projects develop and thereby introduce errors into programs.  Having an automatic system for checking the consistency of source code with the high-level\r\ndesign decisions behind it will help programmers avoid these mistakes.  The second objective of this research is to develop techniques for checking the correctness of programs written in multiple languages.\r\nCurrent program analysis technology focuses on programs written in one language, yet modern software is often written in a mix of different languages.  By developing analysis techniques that can span multiple\r\nlanguages and check conditions at the interface between the languages, programmers will be given new tools to help them ensure that multi-language systems are correct.  Ultimately, the results of this research are expected have long-term benefits in the improvement of software quality.\r\n\r\n",
