 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to support the activities of the Education Committee and the Young Protein Scientists Committee at the 18th Annual Symposium of The Protein Society, August 14-18, 2004, San Diego, California. Two workshops will be organized.  The first workshop is titled, \"Computational Approaches in Protein Chemistry.\" The speakers will review both fundamental principles and practical aspects of various computational packages for investigations in protein science that will aid graduate and undergraduate students in their research and education. The second \"A CAREER Workshop\" will not only address career opportunities after graduation but also will provide undergraduates with summer monitoring opportunities doing research in industry and government. This will not only open opportunities other than academia but it will also provide a window into the excitement of research and development in industry and government. In addition other activities for which support from NSF is not requested include an opening reception at the University of San Diego. This will provide an opportunity for undergraduates and their advisors to meet one another and participate in an informal setting to discuss the role of protein science in undergraduate courses. One of the regular sessions organized by these committees is oral presentations by undergraduate and graduate students chosen from the posters and in 2004 the Society will choose two undergraduate students to receive a poster award ($300) in addition to 8 for graduate students.",
