Tipper\r\n\r\nThis project will develop a set of educational materials (slides, draft textbook manuscript and a laboratory manual) for a course on mobile information systems that deals with the special challenges posed by mobile information systems.  These include such issues as the need to track and route information to the mobile user, the limited battery life and display capabilities of devices, security, and frequency planning. . The track will look at not only the technical aspects, usually considered in standard engineering courses, but also at the challenges in developing application software and the economic and regulatory aspects of these systems.  The planned course together with a more commonly found course in Wireless Networks can form a focused study in the development, design and deployment of such systems.  The course supported by these materials can be taught in undergraduate information science, computer science and electrical and computer engineering curricula.",
