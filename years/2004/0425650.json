 "awd_abstract_narration": "Perception seems effortless and yet it remains one of the most challenging scientific topics.  For instance, how do we separate beach chairs from the beach in visual perception, or from the people in a crowded beach scene?  Indeed it remains a general puzzle how we may see objects in a scene separate from one another and from their backgrounds.  Recent computer models succeed in segregating objects in pictures only when past experience is allowed to play a role. With NSF support Dr. Mary Peterson will follow this lead to investigate scene separation in human perception, specifically the effects of previous experience with objects on later perception of the same objects.\r\nBroader impacts include supervision and training of students from underrepresented groups and outreach activities to local high schools.  The funded research will also supply equipment to the University of Arizona for data analysis and storage.  Findings will also be disseminated through a laboratory website.\r\n",
