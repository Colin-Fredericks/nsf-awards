 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is investigating the impact that experimentation with nanotechnology has on middle, secondary, and university students' learning of science and perceptions about science. The enabling tool of this project is the nanoManipulator (nM), a device to receive visual and haptic feedback from investigations of nanometer-sized objects. In a series of studies involving scientists and students engaged in collaborative guided inquiry experiences, the research team is researching the role of multiple representations (visual or haptic) on the learning of scientific concepts of students with varying cognitive, affective, motivational, and sociological characteristics. The study is also examining the cognitive and affective outcomes on students' perceptions of the nature of science and scientists. In addition, members of the project team are exploring the development of a low-cost alternative to the current nM research tool.\r\n",
