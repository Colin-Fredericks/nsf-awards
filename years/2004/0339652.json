 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop an innovative technology to revolutionize computer access for blind and visually impaired individuals.  The device provides a touchable display with which the user can feel the windows, panels, buttons, menu items, etc., with much the same rapidity and random access available to the sighted Windows user.  The new approach uses an effective but very low cost technique for interacting with the touch receptors of the fingers, avoiding the high cost and complexity associated with mechanical actuator arrays previously used to depict similar tactile images.  Thus, it promises to provide the benefits of global, random access computer interface technology at dramatically reduced cost.  In Phase I, a prototype Dynamic Tactile Display device will be constructed and interfaced with Windows-based accessibility software on the PC.  Several alternatives for tactile display characteristics will be explored, in collaboration with the Arizona Center for the Blind and Visually Impaired (ACBVI).  Volunteer blind participants at ACBVI will be trained on the use of the device.  Objective performance criteria on their use of the device will be measured, and quantitative and qualitative user feedback will be gathered to determine overall user feasibility.\r\n\r\nThe primary societal benefit of the proposed activity is to provide more universal access to computer and Internet technology to the visually impaired community, often underrepresented in professional and social groups using computers.  In addition to the use of this low-cost tactile interface as an assistive device, it may have many applications in control, virtual reality, and communications.  The technology may enable inroads for haptic interfaces for a much wider range of applications than are currently addressed.  As advances in human/computer interactions, haptic interface methodology, and user interface design occur, major opportunities for additional spin-off products and research can be expected.\r\n",
