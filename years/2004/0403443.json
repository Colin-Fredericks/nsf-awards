 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator studies three subjects: extreme value\r\ntheory, ARCH/GARCH models, and nonparametric regression with censored\r\ndata. The particular issues examined in this proposal include:\r\n1) constructing confidence intervals for high quantiles\r\nin risk management; 2) constructing confidence intervals\r\nfor the difference of two means with heavy tails; 3)\r\nconstructing confidence intervals for parameters in ARCH/GARCH\r\nmodels; 4) constructing a confidence interval for the maximal\r\nmoment exponent of a GARCH (1,1) sequence; 5) forecasting the\r\n1-step ahead conditional Value-at-Risk based on GARCH models;\r\n6) applying the data tilting method to obtain confidence\r\nintervals for the tail index of a double autoregressive model;\r\nand 7) applying the data tilting method to obtain confidence\r\nintervals for a conditional survival function with censored data.\r\nThe proposed activity described above involves\r\nnovel applications of data tilting methods. The research\r\napproach is a combination of theoretical asymptotic analysis,\r\nMonte Carlo simulation and real data analysis.\r\n\r\nThe problems studied in this project arise from real \r\napplications in various fields including\r\nmeteorology, hydrology,  insurance, and\r\nfinance.  Examples are: in the design of electrical\r\ndistribution systems and buildings, the extremes of \r\nwind pressure loading must be accounted for;\r\ninsurers who underwrite the financial risk associated with\r\n natural risks like floods, storms and earthquakes must \r\nhave good estimates of the size and impact of extreme events in\r\norder to set their premiums at a profitable level.\r\nThis project studies the following issues: modeling extreme\r\nevents; predicting Value-at-Risk in  risk\r\nmanagement; estimating frontier functions for comparing the \r\nperformance of different firms; estimating parameters\r\nof volatility models in financial time series; and estimating the\r\nconditional life time in assessing the influence of risk factors\r\non survival.  Progress in this project can enhance\r\nthe interaction among several areas in statistical science, including\r\nextreme value theory, nonparametric smoothing, time series analysis,\r\nand survival analysis.  The new methods to be developed\r\ncan be applied to financial time series, sea level prediction,\r\ninternet traffic data, medical data, to name a few. The\r\ntheoretical asymptotic results to be developed are expected to have\r\nbroader applications as well.\r\n",
