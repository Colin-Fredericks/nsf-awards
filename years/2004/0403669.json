 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this research are to design, fabricate, and test molecular wires, and singlemolecule\r\nelectronic devices, in particular diodes, light-activated switches and transistors, based\r\non dimetal inorganic complexes containing metal-metal bonds. These metal complexes provide\r\nbetter control and tunability of electron transport properties as compared to organic molecules\r\nused in molecular devices to date. The approach is to incorporate these complexes into various\r\ntwo- or three-terminal nano-junctions formed by nanolithography, and to measure their electron\r\ntransport characteristics, such as rectification and amplification. The educational component\r\nincludes a jointly developed and co-taught course to train students in molecular electronics\r\nduring Spring 2005, as well as a one week summer workshop on instrumentation techniques.\r\nThe miniaturization of current silicon-based electronic devices is approaching a limit set by\r\nphysical and economical constraints. Alternative technologies, such as molecular electronics, are\r\nrequired to overcome this limit and increase computation speed. Here, molecules are utilized as\r\nconventional electronic devices. The research proposed herein explores the feasibility of using\r\ndimetal inorganic complexes as components in molecular electronics. If successful, the proposed\r\nresearch will open new avenues for designing molecular electronic devices and will provide\r\ninsight into the electron transport of molecules. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed\r\nresearch will provide students with opportunities to communicate with researchers from different\r\nfields. The nanoscale characterization and fabrication proposed in the research will give students\r\nhands-on experience in using state-of-the-art equipment commonly used in nanoscience and\r\ntechnology. This will better prepare them for careers in this exciting research area.",
