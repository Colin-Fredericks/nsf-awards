 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is awarding twenty-eight scholarships per year for four years to students enrolled in a computer science, computer networking, telecommunications, engineering or mathematics transfer program, and/or to enter the workforce.\r\n\r\nThe project is creating a coherent learning community that integrates learning across disciplines to provide a connectedness between CSEMS disciplines and to create a method to retain students by providing a pathway to other opportunities within the CSEMS disciplines. Faculty advisors and mentors are providing continuous academic and career guidance; identifying opportunities for field experience, conferences, and internships; and integrating CSEMS project services with TRIO and Concurrent Enrollment Programs. The project is targeting women and underrepresented minorities, who make up almost half of the K-12 students within their service area.\r\n\r\nA two-credit seminar is being provided to improve interaction with business, foster awareness across disciplines, and to provide opportunities for site visits and job shadowing. Second year scholars are being trained to serve as mentors to first year scholars. Support services are being integrated with CSEMS activities. Included are math and science clubs, child-care subsidies, identification of internship opportunities, a competency-based Education/Credit program, and a career placement system. \r\n",
