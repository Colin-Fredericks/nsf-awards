 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Czech research project involves Radek Lopusnik, Zbigniew Celinski, and Robert Camley of the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs and Stefan Visnovsky of Charles University, Prague.  Their goal is to optimize magnetic multilayered structures for applications in high frequency magneto-optical probing and sampling.  The international collaboration benefits from the expertise of the U.S. group in magnetization dynamics and quality sample preparation and is complemented by the Czech partners' strengths in magneto-optical spectroscopy.\r\n\r\nTogether the U.S.-Czech team will investigate a series of multilayered structures by means of magneto-optical (MO) spectroscopy, ferromagnetic resonance, light scattering and time-resolved magneto-optics.  They intend to extract optical and magneto optical constants by using a developed model for MO response to suggest structures with both a high magneto-optical figure of merit and high presessional frequency.  After studies of the influences of multiple magnetic layers, theoretical calculations, and attempts to grow promising nanostructures, the researchers hope proceed with efforts to deposit the best structure on a cantilever and perform test measurements.  If successful, results may be applicable to detection of microwave radiated fields which could lead to improved ability to identify hidden electromagnetic interference sources on printed circuit boards and integrated circuits. \r\n\r\nThis project in condensed matter physics fulfills the program objective of advancing scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the United States and Central Europe to combine complementary talents and share research resources in areas of strong mutual interest and competence.   Broader impacts include the introduction of U.S. students to the international materials research community through work at the Czech institution and direct involvement in the project's magneto-optical methods.",
