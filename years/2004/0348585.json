 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project aims to elucidate intentionally and unintentionally introduced chemical groups' effects on the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes. In particular, effects of oxygen adsorption and chemical oxidation on charge carrier injection and photo-induced processes will be investigated. Variations in synthesis and fabrication procedures to be developed for these studies will be utilized in creating surface modifications to control optical and electrical properties and to create organized nanostructures of various chemical compositions. Expected outcomes include insights into chemical reactivity and electronic properties of nanotubes, and fundamental materials science knowledge and insights into relatively unexplored areas of optoelectronics and photochemistry of carbon nanotubes. Understanding how electronic properties are affected by surface functional groups is expected to be useful in rational design of organized nanostructures and developing nanotube-based sensor technology. Synthetic efforts to control chemical compo-sition and electronic properties may also lead to new nanoscale materials.\r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses fundamental research issues in electronic materials science having techno-logical relevance. The educational program will enrich undergraduate curricula and research opportunities. Improvement of existing topics and introduction of new topics for courses on introductory materials science and engineering and nanoscience will be carried out. By developing a new online version of an introductory materials science and engineering course, which will be available to students at Clark Atlanta University and other minority-serving institutions, en-hanced course availability for students of underrepresented groups will be provided. Research opportunities created for undergraduate students at the PI's laboratory will directly integrate research into the educational process. The PI's graduate students will participate as teaching assistants for the on-line course and as research mentors providing them with important mentoring experiences and awareness of diversity issues. Research and educational collaborations with faculty at Clark Atlanta will promote diversity and interaction between institutions. The educational program outlined here will be an integral part of a partnership between the PI's department at UIUC and Clark Atlanta University and will create infrastructure and resources to enhance education and research. Multifaceted challenges to be directly tackled here will provide ample educational opportunities needed especially for researchers in emerging cross-disciplinary fields. \r\n***   \r\n",
