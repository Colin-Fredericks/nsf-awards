 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fort Worth Museum of Science and Technology will partner with The Exploratorium and with three smaller science museums that have strong connections to rural and Spanish-speaking populations in Texas:  Discovery Science Place, Loredo Children's Museum, and Science Spectrum to develop TexNET, a four-year project modeled on the Exploratorium Network for Exhibit-based Teaching (ExNET).  TexNET builds on lessons learned from past exhibit outreach models and addresses the needs of small, rural partners for exhibits and capacity-building workshops.  Each small museum partner will host a set of ten exhibits for one year.  Exhibit topics are 1)motion, 2)weather and 3)sound.  Workshops focus on inquiry learning techniques, science content, programming and workshop design, as well as the institutional needs of each partner.  Inverness Research Associates will conduct the project evaluation.  They will examine the success of this project by looking at the effectiveness of the TexNET model, the success of the individual exhibit elements to engage rural communities, the effectiveness with which this project has enhanced the abilities of local rural communities to sustain their own educational improvements and the effectiveness of the training components in increasing the capabilities of the local museums to serve their rural audiences.",
