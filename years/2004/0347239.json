 "awd_abstract_narration": "Model reduction for control of fluids\r\nC. W. Rowley\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nMany powerful techniques are available for analyzing and controlling \r\ndynamical systems, if one has a tractable mathematical model, for \r\ninstance in the form of a differential equation.  For fluids, and many \r\nother systems of interest, models are well known, but are too complex \r\nfor traditional techniques from dynamical systems and control theory to \r\nbe practical.  This program develops techniques for obtaining simpler \r\nmodels of complex systems, in order to provide a bridge between \r\ninteresting multiscale applications, and the mathematical tools useful \r\nfor their analysis and control.  The techniques will then be used to \r\naddress problems in fluid mechanics, focusing on controlling transition \r\nto turbulence in a plane channel.\r\n\r\nSpecific model reduction techniques addressed will include balanced \r\ntruncation and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), and symmetry \r\nreduction methods from geometric mechanics.  Each of these techniques \r\nhas severe limitations when applied to fluids problems.  POD often \r\nproduces highly unreliable models, and often the accuracy of the models \r\ndoes not improve as the number of modes increases.  Balanced truncation \r\napplies to stable linear systems, and has good error bounds that \r\nimprove as the number of modes increases, but the method is not \r\ntractable for very large systems such as fluids.  A central component \r\nof the research involves a new method for performing \"balanced POD,\" \r\nwhich may be viewed as form of weighted POD that more heavily weights \r\nstates of large dynamical importance.  In addition, ideas from symmetry \r\nreduction, and heirarchical finite-element modeling combine to guide \r\nthe development of local versions of POD and balanced truncation, which \r\nwill capture traveling structures better than the global basis \r\nfunctions produced by standard POD and balanced truncation.\r\n\r\nThe educational components of the program include developing an \r\nexchange program with Brazil, in order to promote engineering education \r\nin an international setting.  In addition, a new outreach program will \r\nhelp local elementary school teachers introduce engineering into K-6 \r\nclassrooms, by organizing undergraduates to volunteer their time to \r\nassist with the technical aspects of engineering projects.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
