 "awd_abstract_narration": "To address the need for economic diversification and the expansion of a well-educated, highly-skilled technology workforce, the Community College of Southern Nevada plans the establishment of an ATE Regional Center for Information and Telecommunications Technology.  A Technology Education Alliance advisory board organizes the development of a strategic plan to build upon investments already made by the State of Nevada. The plan pulls together business, economic development, and secondary and postsecondary schools to foster relationships to launch an effective educational system for producing workers highly-qualified for the workforce.  The Alliance increases industry input into higher education programs, coordinating an analysis of core competencies needed for emerging technologies.  Plans are made for academic support services to increase the recruitment and retention of women and other groups underrepresented in technological education.",
