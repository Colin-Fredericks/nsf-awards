 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extreme erosion characterizes Madagascar's central highlands.  The country has a \"world-record \r\nerosion rate\" according to the World Bank, and the widespread hillslope gullies called lavaka are \r\nfeatured in every guidebook as examples of the catastrophic denudation of the country.s \r\nlandscape.  Lavakas, which have been described as .cat claw-marks. on the landscape, initiate \r\nsuddenly and grow rapidly, shedding sediment volumes on the order of  8000 m3 in a few months.  \r\nThey cause substantial infrastructural problems because they undermine roads and bridges, and \r\nbecause the debris flows that issue from them swamp agricultural land.  They are widely cited as \r\nbeing largely or entirely anthropogenic in origin, and the major source of high sediment loads in \r\nMadagascar's rivers.  Neither of these interpretations is based on hard data, however, and in spite \r\nof the importance of this issue, both from an economic and an environmental point of view, of \r\nerosion are largely unstudied.  Strong statements abound, but there are no data to constrain the \r\nrates at which lavakas form, or their relative contribution to regional sediment budgets; and the \r\ngeological controls on their formation are largely unknown. \r\nThe proposed project will address the issue of modern erosion in Madagascar by investigating \r\nrates of lavaka formation and geological controls on their initiation. Analysis of changes in lavaka \r\ndistribution and size will be achieved by combining air photo mapping of lavaka distributions 60 \r\nyears ago and field mapping of present-day lavaka distributions in a GIS database.  This will \r\npermit evaluation of decadal-scale sediment generation volumes, as well as lavaka evolution \r\nrates.  Cosmogenic isotope analysis will produce sediment generation rates on the millennial \r\nscale, which can be compared with the mapping-derived rates of recent erosion to evaluate \r\nwhether erosion rates have in fact increased in recent time as has been frequently asserted but \r\nnever demonstrated.  Quantification of human effects on lavaka formation and growth will be \r\nachieved by GIS analysis of mapped distributions of lavakas and their relationship to different \r\nland-use categories.  Understanding of geologic controls on the location of lavakas will come \r\nfrom detailed mapping of the structural geology of underlying saprolitized bedrock and slope \r\ncharacteristics.  \r\nThe results of this project will be of significance to studies of human interactions with the \r\nlandscape in general.  They will have direct relevance for environmental planning and erosion \r\nmitigation strategies for Madagascar.  Establishment of geologic criteria predisposing some \r\nslopes to lavaka formation could save enormous amounts of money by providing preventive \r\nplanning strategies for road and dam building organizations.  Above all, understanding the role of \r\nlavakas in sediment generation; the role of humans in lavaka formation; and whether Madagascar \r\nis naturally characterized by high erosion rates or whether they are of recent and anthropogenic \r\norigin, will solidify thinking about ecological strategizing in Madagascar and contribute to a \r\nbetter understanding of the islands exogenic system as a whole. \r\nThis project will be a wonderful way to train students in the process of approaching a scientific \r\nproblem that has direct societal relevance.  Linking education and international collaboration is \r\nalso a key component of this project.  Undergraduate students, both American and Malagasy, will \r\nget intense one-on-one mentoring and training in the field and in the lab, as well as hands-on \r\nexperience with a variety of analytical tools and GIS/remote sensing techniques.  The project will \r\nprovide opportunities for third-world Malagasy students to travel to the U.S. for education and \r\ntraining, and  will also create career training and research opportunities for Malagasy \r\ncollaborators.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Division of Earth Science and the Office of International Science and Education.\r\n",
