 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will integrate Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) with Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) optical switching to make the critical network element needed for reconfigurable, transparent, high capacity fiber optic networks. This technological advancement will facilitate the transition from today's point-to-point opaque networks with optical to electrical to optical (OEO) electrical switches to transparent, dynamic all optical networks. The design involves free space optical design, fiber optic design, MEMS design and optical coating design in order to make a wavelength switch which has low loss, low polarization independent loss, low temperature sensitivity, low vibration sensitivity, properly shaped pass bands (flattop with good adjacent channel rejection) and low crosstalk. The design will be developed, constructed and tested in Phase II, significantly advancing the field of optical switching from where it is today.\r\n\r\nThis integrated wavelength switch should have numerous applications in commercial and government networks. The capacity is huge: 4 fibers with 40 wavelengths each carrying 40 Gbit/s of data results in 6 Terabit/s switching capacity. This allows continued growth in the Internet, and enables a much lower cost solution to higher capacity wavelength services. Continued expansion of access to information requires continued expansion of worldwide core optical networks.",
