One project is to consider \r\nwhen an equivalence between derived categories is induced by a \r\nmore richly structured equivalence.  The goal here is to develop \r\nan obstruction theory for realizing derived equivalences by \r\nunderlying structured equivalences.  In particular, this may have applications to the question associated to Broue's Conjecture in \r\nrepresentation theory of which stable equivalences lift to derived equivalences.  The second project is to develop homotopy theoretic algebraic models.  One piece of this project is to continue work \r\nwith John Greenlees on algebraic models for rational equivariant cohomology theories.  More generally, the investigator proposes \r\nto develop algebraic models for various stable homotopy theories.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research projects involve the interplay beween the \r\nstudy of algebraic structures and topology, the study of shapes \r\nor spaces.  Algebraic topologists use algebraic structures to \r\ndescribe and simplify topological phenomena.  In a project on\r\nrealizing derived equivalences, the investigator hopes to use techniques developed in algebraic topology to attack questions \r\nwhich originate in algebra.  These techniques include the use \r\nof a theory of obstructions, which determines whether certain constructions are possible.   In another project the \r\ninvestigator plans on extending existing algebraic models to \r\ninclude structures involving symmetries.  The educational \r\ncomponent of this proposal also includes several parts.  \r\nThe investigator will be involved in the summer research \r\nprograms for undergraduates at the University of Chicago \r\nand Purdue University.  With Lucho Avramov, she will organize \r\na workshop on topics related to derived categories of interest \r\nto a broad range of algebraically related fields.  With \r\nJim McClure and Guershon Harel, the investigator will develop \r\na new course for mathematics education majors based on Euler's ``Elements of Algebra\".  The goals of this course are to help mathematical education students master skills in algebra, \r\ndevelop confidence for teaching algebra, and understand the \r\nmotivation for material contained in a standard abstract \r\nalgebra course.  The investigator will also participate in several aspects of the Women in Science Program at Purdue University. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
