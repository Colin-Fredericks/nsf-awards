 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an abstract for award DMS-0400942 of Paula B. Cohen.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on studying various aspects of moduli spaces of \r\nabelian varieties, including the transcendence of special values of functions \r\ndefined on them, hyperbolic equidistribution of their subvarieties, as well as \r\nquestions related to their noncommutative geometry. The problems we study will \r\ninclude the development and application of results on the distribution of \r\nspecial points on Shimura varieties to questions in transcendence, and the \r\nexploration of the notion of the noncommutative boundary of Shimura varieties. \r\nWe also propose to complete, in collaboration with F. Hirzebruch, a book of \r\nlecture notes on complex surfaces and line arrangements that will include \r\nmaterial related to the above research.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe algebraic numbers are those complex numbers that are roots of non-zero \r\npolynomials with rational number coefficients. The transcendental numbers are \r\nthose complex numbers that are not algebraic. Inspired by the seventh of \r\nHilbert's famous list of 23 problems coined in 1900, some celebrated research \r\nin the first half of the 20th century uncovered the first significant links \r\nbetween transcendental numbers and important phenomena in the arithmetic of \r\ngeometric objects. Our research focuses on the modern development of these \r\nideas. We also pursue these ideas in the context of recent research on \r\nrelations between classical number theory and a modern variant of geometry \r\ninspired by quantum physics, so-called noncommutative geometry. In addition, \r\nwe propose to complete a book of lecture notes for graduate students and \r\nresearchers, with an emphasis on certain special functions called \r\nhypergeometric functions, and their relation to geometry in complex dimension \r\n2.\r\n",
