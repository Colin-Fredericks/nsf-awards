Using\r\nvariational approach and techniques in classical analysis, Professor Ni\r\nand his collaborators have established the spike-layer steady states for\r\nan activator-inhibitor system in morphogenesis proposed by Gierer and\r\nMeinhardt based on the celebrated idea - diffusion-driven instability - of\r\nTuring in 1952. The method exploits the gap between the diffusion rates\r\nfor the two chemical substances, and stability results in one space\r\ndimension have also been obtained. Very recently, progress has been made\r\nfor concentration phenomena on multi-dimensional subsets. However, the\r\ncomplete dynamics is still far from being fully understood. It has been\r\nnoted that the gap between the diffusion rates alone is insufficient to\r\ncreate patterns. Thus, the notion of \"cross-diffusion,\" introduced by\r\ntheoretical biologists in 1979 in modeling segregation phenomena in\r\npopulation dynamics, deserves systematic studies. Cross-diffusion systems,\r\nwhich have also been used in recent years to model singular phenomena\r\nincluding dendritic growth of bacteria colonies, are both nonlinear and\r\nstrongly-coupled in highest order terms, thus are mathematically very\r\nchallenging. Professor Ni and his collaborators propose to study the\r\neffects of cross-diffusion by first obtain necessary and sufficient\r\nconditions for cross-diffusion to help create patterns, and then to\r\ninvestigate their qualitative behavior as well as their stability\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n(II) Non-technical Descriptions:\r\n\r\nProfessor Ni plans to continue his research in understanding, in a\r\nmathematically rigorous manner, the phenomena and effects of various\r\ndiffusion-related mechanisms and hopefully thereby to have some impact in\r\nboth improving our ability in modeling more complicated and/or realistic\r\nphenomena in applied sciences, as well as in creating new and significant\r\nmathematics. In this proposal, from the viewpoint of pattern formation,\r\nProfessor Ni intends to investigate the various \"concentration phenomena\"\r\nin diffusion and/or cross-diffusion systems. These, in particular, include\r\nTuring patterns in chemical reactions (e.g. the CIMA reaction),\r\nGierer-Meinhardt's activator-inhibitor systems in modeling the\r\nregeneration phenomena of hydra in morphogenesis, a nonlinear diffusion\r\nsystem modeling dendritic growth of bacteria colonies, and the\r\nLotka-Volterra competition systems with inter-specific population\r\npressures taken into considerations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n",
