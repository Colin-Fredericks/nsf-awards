 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent years have seen the advent of DNA-based computation, as well as the development of a\r\nDNA nanotechnology that produces objects, robust devices and periodic arrays. We propose to\r\ncombine these areas, by using a robust 2-state DNA device and DNA array assembly techniques\r\nto prototype a programmable finite state machine capable of performing simple computations.\r\nThe goal is to produce a system that is programmable, produces an output and is reusable.\r\nWe exploit connections between Wang tiles, finite state machines (transducers) and com-\r\nputable functions. The main idea uses DNA TX molecules to represent transducer transitions\r\nand a sequence of 2-state DNA devices to program the input. Once the input is programmed,\r\nthe computation of the transducer is obtained solely by DNA self-assembly. Further more, iter-\r\nations and composition of transducers is also possible and hence all computable functions can\r\nbe obtained.\r\nThe project is composed of two major tasks,\r\n1. To simulate computation by a finite state machine with output by a single assembly of\r\ninput molecules and TX transition molecules.\r\n2. To obtain transducer computation with a programmale input by DNA 2-state devices and\r\nTX molecules.\r\nIntelectual Merit. The project prototypes a nanomachine that is potentially programmable\r\nand produces an output that can serve as an input in a new device or as a template for orga-\r\nnization and growth of nanostructures used in nanoelectronics. The proposed machine has a\r\npotential for an algorithmic control of this growth. Theoretically, the design of the machine and\r\nthe need for encoding (locally and globally) that is error correcting will lead to development of\r\nnew techniques in algorithmic pattern design.\r\nBroader Impact. Research in DNA-based computation relies on many disciplines, such as\r\ncomputer science, DNA chemistry, nucleic acid enzymology, thermodynamics and molecular\r\nphysics. Few individuals enter in to it with adequate preparation. We will attempt to provide\r\nsome remedy for this problem during the course of this project. The graduate, undergraduate\r\nand high school students who participate in this work will be uniquely trained and will be\r\nprepared as unique interdisciplinary research scientists. Three graduate students (two at New\r\nYork University and one at the University of South Florida) will receive graduate training\r\nthrough this award. They will meet with each other, and become familiar with the thinking and\r\nmethodologies of their opposite colleagues in the other university. In addition, we will include\r\nan undergraduate in the project, to gain experience in combining computer science with DNA\r\nnanotechnology. We aim to include a high school student in the parts of the work for which\r\nthey are eligible (e.g., computation and experiments not entailing the use of radiation).\r\nBesides their own nanotechnological and mathematical disciplines, the PI and the co-PI are\r\nprominent members of the DNA-based computation community. Both facets of this commu-\r\nnity recognize that it is converging with structural DNA nanotechnology. In recognition of\r\nthis interdisciplinary phenomenon, the PI and the co-PI are involved in founding (as president\r\nand treasurer, respectively) the \\International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation and\r\nEngineering\" with a goal to facilitate communication among the members of the participating\r\ncommunities, and to recognize and promote the careers of the younger members, by offering\r\nthem recognition and a forum for their ideas.",
