C. Clark, S. Jeschonnek, R. J. Perry \r\nThe study of a wide range of problems involving strongly interacting systems is proposed. The \r\nprojects proposed fall into several broad categories, ranging from studies directly involving quark \r\nand gluon degrees of freedom, to effective theories of the strong interaction at low energies, to \r\nanalyses of strong-interaction experiments. \r\nIntellectual merit: The transition from hadronic degrees of freedom to quark-gluon degrees of \r\nfreedom will be studied though increasingly sophisticated models of quark-hadron duality and by investigating short-range structure in light nuclei through improved theoretical tools for disentangling \r\nthe nuclear ground state information from coincidence electron scattering data. These projects have \r\nstrong and direct ties to the experimental program at Jefferson Lab. Other projects revisit QCD \r\nsum rules, which exploit another facet of quark-hadron duality. The renormalization group tools \r\ndeveloped in the light-front field theory program are largely redirected toward low-energy effective \r\nfield theories. \r\nEffective theories of nuclear systems, which are governed by low-energy quantum chromodynamics \r\n(QCD), are being developed from two directions. From one side, fundamental work extending \r\neffective field theories (EFT) for nucleon-nucleon, three-body systems, and many-body systems is \r\nproposed. In parallel, from the other side, are projects to improve phenomenological descriptions \r\nof realistic nuclear systems to reduce model dependence. The efforts complement each other and \r\nboth will impact forefront problems in nuclear physics, such as the study of nuclei far from stability. \r\nRenormalization group methods play important roles in each category. The goal of model independence is naturally coupled with the recognition of universal aspects of the physics, which in turn enhances interactions with other disciplines. \r\nOngoing efforts to develop relativistic descriptions of a wide range of nuclear reactions and \r\nnuclear structure (e.g., global optical potential, nuclear densities, meson-nucleus scattering, inelastic \r\nreactions) will take advantage of EFT input. Reliable extractions of neutron densities will be made \r\nfor more nuclei, and the optical potentials will be extended to higher energies and applied to studies \r\nof parity violation. \r\nBroader impacts: The training received by undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral \r\nresearch associates in carrying out the proposed activities contributes directly to the building \r\nof a diverse scientific workforce. The mix of analytical and numerical computation our students and \r\npostdocs must employ is excellent preparation for both academic and industrial research. Activities \r\nfunded by an REU supplement will actively involve undergraduates in research; all previous REU \r\nstudents in the group who have graduated are either working in industry, or business, or enrolled in \r\nprofessional or graduate school. The group is committed to diversity in science and has successfully mentored several members of under-represented groups, including four who have obtained faculty positions. Several proposed projects provide data to the Nuclear Data Center at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Direct benefits to society include the development of global optical potentials, which are being used to estimate cross sections that are important for understanding long-term radioactive waste storage, and calculations of nuclear cross sections, which are used in predicting dosimetry for patients in radiation therapy. \r\n\r\n",
