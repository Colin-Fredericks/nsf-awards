In the\r\narea of complex and symplectic geometry, integrable systems, and\r\nmathematical physics, amazing new developments have been achieved\r\nin recent years. At the time of their discovery in 1985,\r\nDonaldson invariants of differentiable four manifolds, Jones\r\npolynomials of knots and links, and Gromov's idea of pseudo-\r\nholomorphic curves were considered as independent entities.\r\nSince the time of Atiyah's provocative lecture in 1988, their\r\nhidden inter-relations have been emerged. Through the work of\r\nmany mathematicians and physicists, a clearer picture of the\r\nconnection of these theories is revealed. Most recently, more\r\ndirect relations have been discovered, through calculation of the\r\ngenerating function of these invariants and their association\r\nwith integrable systems and representation theory. Among them is\r\nthe work of Okounkov and Pandharipande, who determined the\r\nGromov-Witten invariants of an arbitrary compact Riemann surface\r\nas the target space. Their fundamental results include a proof of\r\nthe conjectured Virasoro constraints, identification of the\r\ngenerating function of the invariants of the Riemann sphere as a\r\nsolution to the two-dimensional Toda lattice equations through\r\nFermionic Fock representation, and a new proof of the\r\nWitten-Kontsevich theory of intersection of cohomology classes on\r\nthe moduli space of Riemann surfaces. We propose to establish\r\nGromov-Witten theory of real algebraic curves without boundary,\r\nand obtain the counterpart of the above theorems for the case of\r\nnon-orientable surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe topological and geometric structures of various kinds of\r\nspaces have attracted intensive research in mathematics and\r\nmathematical physics for many decades. Poincare's idea on\r\nhomology and homotopy theories have proven to be useful\r\nthroughout the 20th century. The applications of these theories\r\nare seen in physics, chemistry, and understanding the dynamical\r\nproperties of DNA.  Only toward the end of the previous century\r\nmathematics has encountered a true generalization of the ideas of\r\nPoincare, applicable to the particularly interesting spaces\r\n(called symplectic manifolds) that appear naturally in any kinds\r\nof mechanics and dynamics. The new invariants, known as the\r\nGromov-Witten invariants of symplectic spaces, have shown\r\nextremely mysterious connections to almost all areas of\r\nmathematics. Mathematicians feel quite happily that they\r\nunderstand the homology and homotopy theories very well. Compared\r\nto that level, our current understanding of the Gromov-Witten\r\ntheory is at the best very limited, and the whole subject is\r\nstill filled with mysteries. We believe that to have a deeper\r\nunderstanding of the theory, we should generalize it further and\r\ninclude the consideration of new cases never done before.  The\r\nproposed project is aimed at discovering a generalization of the\r\ntheory in a particular context, using non-orientable surfaces.\r\n",
