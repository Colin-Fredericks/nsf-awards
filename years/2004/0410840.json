 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering-Engineering Technology (58)  Infusion of Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) technology is improving the undergraduate education curricula in the area of Manufacturing Technology, Electrical/Electronics Technology and Computer Aided Design & Graphics in the Department of Industrial and Engineering Technology at Morehead State University. \r\n\r\nThe project is adapting Purdue's Flexible Manufacturing System by using a MiniCIM 3.2 Flexible Manufacturing System from Amatrol. The project is (1) using a systematic approach for planning, developing and evaluating the courses related to Flexible Manufacturing Systems, with a focus on demonstrations, class and senior projects, and laboratory exercises; and (2) incorporating Computer Integrated Manufacturing Technology laboratory strategy into class and senior projects. \r\n\r\nStudent assessment and project evaluations are being conducted at each stage of the project to ensure that student-learning is improving by demonstrating that (1) students are becoming more proficient in fundamental concepts and applications of robotics and automation in Flexible Manufacturing Systems; (2) students are gaining technical skills and knowledge using innovative software within Flexible Manufacturing Systems; and (3) a hands-on approach is addressing the diversity of students' learning styles, including women and underrepresented students.\r\n\r\nThe project is having a broad impact on undergraduate students within Morehead State University's service region by increasing the availability of highly trained engineering and technology graduates. Two-year community and technical colleges are using the equipment in scheduled laboratory classes.  \r\n\r\n",
