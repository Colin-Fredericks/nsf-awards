 "awd_abstract_narration": "The critically endangered Kloss's gibbon (Hylobates klossii) is found only on Indonesia's Mentawai Islands, a small chain of four islands located off the west coast of Sumatra. The Mentawai Islands have been long isolated from the rest of the region, and therefore little is known about the relationships of this little-studied ape to other gibbon species in neighboring areas. \r\n\r\nIn addition, some researchers have suggested that the other three Mentawai primate species have two distinct subspecies with different coloration and behavior: one on the northernmost island of Siberut, the other on the three southern islands. No distinction has been proposed for populations of Kloss's gibbons, since all Kloss's gibbons have completely black fur, exhibiting no obvious variation, and no behavioral studies have been conducted outside of Siberut. However, the Kloss's gibbon shares a biogeographic history with the other three species, strongly suggesting that the separation between Siberut and the southern islands affecting differentiation in the monkeys should also affect the gibbons. Genetic patterns of intraspecific variation within H. klossii have never been studied.\r\n\r\nFecal samples from wild gibbon groups will be non-invasively collected from sites on all four Mentawai Islands. Using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers, this project will address the following research questions:\r\n\r\n1)How is the Kloss's gibbon related to other members of the genus Hylobates?\r\n2)What is the relationship between geography and genetic population structure within and between the Mentawai Islands?\r\n3)What are the implications of these data for conservation planning in the Mentawai Islands?\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only legally protected area in the Mentawais is Siberut National Park. Data from this project may be used to support increased protection of the park, and, if multiple genetically distinct groups or \"conservation units\" are found, to encourage the gazetting of new protected areas. All four Mentawai primates are threatened or endangered, and any conservation action for the Kloss's gibbon, the flagship species, will also benefit these primates. The investigators will work closely with local Mentawai people, as well as Indonesian students and academics, increasing local conservation education and international scientific collaboration.\r\n",
