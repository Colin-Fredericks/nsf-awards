 "awd_abstract_narration": "Davis and Januszkiewicz plan to continue their research on geometric\r\ngroup theory, nonpositively curved spaces and L^2-cohomology.  The \r\nmajor portion of their work will focus on the new theory of the \r\n''weighted L^2-cohomology'' of the complex associated to a Coxeter \r\ngroup. The \"weighting\" depends on word length in the Coxeter group \r\nand a positive real parameter q.  When q is integral, the theory is \r\nintimately tied to the ordinary L^2-cohomology of buildings.  As q \r\nvaries from 0 to infinity the theory interpolates between ordinary \r\ncohomology and cohomology with compact supports.  Davis and \r\nJanuszkiewicz are trying to calculate these weighted cohomology \r\nspaces when q lies in a certain intermediate range.  They are also \r\ntrying to extend this theory to other classes of groups besides \r\nCoxeter groups.\r\n\r\nThe theory of groups generated by reflections plays an important role \r\nin many different areas of mathematics, for example, in Lie theory \r\nand in the theory of algebraic groups.  Around 1960 J. Tits \r\nintroduced the notion of a \"Coxeter group.\"  Synonymous terminology \r\nmight be an \"abstract reflection group.\"  Coxeter groups form a much \r\nwider class of groups than do the classical examples of geometric \r\nreflection groups.  Recently, they have become important in geometric \r\ngroup theory both as a source of new examples and as a paradigm for \r\npredicting new results.  The new research on weighted L^2-cohomology \r\nhas revealed some unexpected connections between several different \r\ntopics in the theory of Coxeter groups.  Much more remains to be \r\ndiscovered.\r\n",
