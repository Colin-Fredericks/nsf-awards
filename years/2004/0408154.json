 "awd_abstract_narration": "The two major cycles in terrestrial environments are daily and seasonal.  Plants and animals use an internal circadian clock to time their daily activities.  Many plants, vertebrates, and insects use the length of day (photoperiod) to anticipate the changing seasons and to time their seasonal activities of growth, development, reproduction, flowering, hibernation, or migration accordingly.  This research is concerned with the molecular connection between the timing of daily activities (circadian rhythmicity) and seasonal activities (photoperiodism).  The strongest environmental cue affecting the timing of both daily and seasonal events is light.  Whereas the light-input pathway and molecular basis of circadian rhythmicity are well understood, little is known about the molecular basis of the regulation of seasonal cycles.  This research uses the pitcher-plant mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, to focus on the connection between the mechanisms regulating daily and seasonal cycles by examining the expression and role of the timeless gene, a gene known to be essential for the input of light and the central functioning of the circadian clock in insects and vertebrates.  Wyeomyia smithii lives over a broad latitudinal range and, as the length of the growing season changes over this range, so also does the day length used to switch between active summer development and winter dormancy.  This divergence of response to day length will be used to determine (1) how the expression patterns of timeless vary with latitude of origin and day length and (2) how polymorphism at the level of DNA varies with latitude of origin and day length.  This research is unique in that it will be evaluating not only the connection between the daily and seasonal timing processes, but also show how at the molecular level that connection varies over a gradient of climate through evolutionary time.",
