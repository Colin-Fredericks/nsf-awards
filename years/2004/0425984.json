 "awd_abstract_narration": "Oceanic islands hold particular interest for both evolutionary and\r\nconservation biologists.  Native plants and animals evolved in isolation on\r\nthese islands and provide detailed insights into fundamental evolutionary\r\nprocesses.  However, they characteristically lack well-developed defensive\r\nmechanisms and are exceptionally vulnerable to introduced predators. Using\r\nDNA analyses of museum specimens, we aim to reconstruct the evolutionary\r\nhistory of a critically threatened radiation of land snails from Tahiti\r\n(French Polynesia).  This Pacific island snail fauna has recently been\r\ndriven to the brink of extinction by an introduced predatory land\r\nsnail.  Our museum samples predate the introduction of the predator and, in\r\ntheir DNA, they collectively contain a genealogical record that we can use\r\nto revise the traditional shell-based taxonomy and to determine how all\r\nthese snails evolved on such a small, geologically young, island.\r\n\r\nOur research will have practical value in helping to prioritize on-going\r\nconservation and rehabilitation efforts.  Collaborative agreements have\r\nbeen established with Zoological Society of London personnel involved in\r\noverseeing captive Tahitian snail zoo populations and in saving the last\r\nremnant wild populations. Our shared aim is to place the remnant wild and\r\ncaptive populations into their proper evolutionary context: that of the\r\npreviously intact fauna, by obtaining DNA profiles of extant wild and\r\ncaptive populations that will be referenced with our historical Tahitian\r\ndatabase.  Preliminary efforts have received considerable general publicity\r\n(e.g., http://whyfiles.org/shorties/151land_snail/index.html).  We\r\nanticipate that our research will be of interest to that fraction of the\r\npublic keen on high-profile conservation biology issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
