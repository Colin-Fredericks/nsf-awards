 "awd_abstract_narration": "0349610\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovative Research Phase II project addresses the development of\r\nInnovative Ultra-Broadband Ferrite Circulators/Isolators. A conventional 3-port ferrite\r\nstripline junction circulator involves a low-Q ferrite stripline resonator so that at the\r\ncirculation frequencies standing-wave resonant modes are excited dumping microwave \r\nenergy from the input port to the output port but not the isolation port. Operation of a \r\nconventional ferrite circulator is nonreciprocal, and the transmission bandwidth is \r\nroughly proportional to the inverse of the Q-factor of the resonator, due to the\r\nstanding-wave nature of the excited resonant modes. A new picture of ferrite-circulator\r\noperation utilizing traveling-wave coupling of microwave signals at the circulation \r\nfrequencies haa been discovered. This is in contrast to the operation of the conventional\r\ncirculators employing standing waves for coupling. As such, ultra-broadband operation of\r\nthe circulators results, whose bandwidth has been measured in Phase I to cover from 1.6 to\r\n16 GHz for a prototype device. It is not possible to acheive this bandwidth with a conventional\r\ncirculator. This leads to a new generation of ferrite circulators or isolators.\r\n\r\nUsing the LTCC technology facilitates mass production in large quantities. As such, generic \r\nmicrowave circulators and isolators can be fabricated at low costs suitable for universal\r\napplications covering across many frequency bands. Ferrite-circulator operation does not \r\nrequire a ferrite resonator anymore. This requirement has been constantly enforced by the\r\noperation of a conventional circulator for more than 50 years. There is always a tremendous\r\nneed for circulators or isolators which are able to provide signal-path separation or protection\r\nover many frequency bands, as demanded by the measurement of a broadband signal and by a\r\nnarrow electromagnetic pulse.",
