 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predictions of global climate change in the Great Plains region of the U.S. include an increase in the duration of droughts and the severity of floods.  These climatic changes will be accompanied by shifts in the abundance and distribution of aquatic organisms that are caused by human modifications to the landscape.  Aquatic research in the Great Plains has indicated a strong influence of flooding and drought on the condition of prairie stream ecosystems.  However, changes in climatic events will be coupled with changes in aquatic biodiversity, and how the combination of these changes will influence prairie stream ecosystems is currently unknown.  The proposed experiments will simulate both changes in climatic events and the abundance of dominant aquatic organisms such as fish and stream-dwelling insects. Using observations from field experiments and from a controlled experimental stream facility, the effects of floods, drought, and the diversity of aquatic life in prairie streams will be characterized.  The experiments will measure the amount of photosynthetic production and the ability of streams to capture nutrients under different climate change scenarios.  \r\n\r\nUnderstanding dynamics of prairie streams is essential for the conservation and management of these ecologically important habitats.  Moreover, when healthy, these streams filter nutrients from the surrounding landscape and can have strong influences on water quality.  The proposed research is consistent with the general theme of the Konza Prairie Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) site and will allow broad assessment of the consequences of climate change on an entire prairie ecosystem.  Research associated with the experimental stream facility at the Konza Prairie Biological Station also will facilitate public education by allowing visitors to directly observe stream organisms.  Recruitment of students from underrepresented groups will be facilitated through cooperation with the Kansas State University Student Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program and the currently funded NSF-REU site activities.\r\n",
