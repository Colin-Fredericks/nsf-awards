 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests support for the travel expenses of junior participants from the U.S. who would otherwise not be able to attend ISIT, such as graduate students, research associates, and new faculty hires.  These participants would be individuals whose papers have been selected for presentation at the Symposium, but who lack funds and would not be able to attend without travel support.  ISIT has a strong tradition of junior participation that has helped it to maintain its reputation as a leading forum for new ideas.  IT is proposed that the co-chairs of the symposium, Daniel Costello and Bruce Hajek, make the awards.",
