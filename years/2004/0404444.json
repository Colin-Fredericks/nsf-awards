Novel micro/nanofluidic chips will be develop and optimized for separating, mixing, concentrating and positioning biomolecules and cells.  Pioneering work in titanium micro/nanofabrication technology with alternating current electrokinetics & microfluidics will be developed to provide unique tools for the biotechnology industry.  Titanium is a relatively new platform for fabrication of nanostructures.  It allows complicated 3-D electrode structures to be fabricated, and is biologically compatible.  Theoretical and experimental analysis of electrokinetic phenomena will be conducted to investigate details of the underlying physics.  The titanium fabrication technology has the potential to revolutionize micro/nanoscale devices, especially in the areas of biotechnology, drug delivery, and in vivo sensing & probing, where durability and bio-compatibility are critical. The advanced electrokinetics and nanoscale electrode structures can be used to concentrate small (~50 nm) proteins and viral particles, which has not been achievable previously using dielectrophoresis.  This research project will provide an opportunity to educate graduate students in the areas of micro/nano fabrication, nanofluidics, electrokinetics, and cell culturing in micro/nanodevices.  The PIs teach a newly-developed three course sequence at the senior/graduate level on MEMS/NEMS design & fabrication, micro/nanofluidics & electrokinetics. These courses give students broad exposure to fundamental issues and the current state of the art in MEMS/NEMS and train students for careers and research opportunities in nanotechnology.  The research program will also be used to advance underrepresented groups in science and engineering.  In addition, the PIs will continue their outreach activities at local high schools, educating students and teachers about how science and technology impacts society, and encouraging students to pursue careers in nanotechnology & science.\r\n\r\n",
