UHD is a non-Ph.D. granting and minority serving institution.  Ongoing and future undergraduate research projects at UHD encompass a wide spectrum of geologic and environmental topics, for which ICP-OES capabilities for trace element determinations in aqueous solutions are essential.  Specific scientific studies currently underway at UHD that will utilize the ICP-OES include: 1) a study of the origin and evolution of sub-volcanic magma chambers, and the tectonic implications of magmatism, in the western United States; 2) a geochemical study of hydrothermal iron ore deposits in the western U.S.; 3) compositional distinctions between geophagous clays (i.e., clay deliberately consumed by humans) and non-geophagous clays; 4) determination of heavy metal pollutants in the Houston Ship Channel; and 5) evaluation of metal contents and metals leaching in heavily agricultural soil profiles.   One of the principal goals of the science faculty at UHD is to produce science graduates with the knowledge and skills necessary for entry into a graduate program, or into science-related employment, directly upon graduation.  Purchase of an ICP-OES will strengthen the science program at UHD, particularly in the geosciences, and will allow students to gain expertise in one of the most powerful analytical tools available today.  It is anticipated that inclusion of this technology will help promote interest in the sciences amongst underrepresented minorities and further enhance other programs at UHD designed to increase the number of minority students earning baccalaureate degrees in the natural sciences.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
