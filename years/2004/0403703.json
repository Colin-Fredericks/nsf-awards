 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop and test a novel diagnostic system to characterize self-assembly of nano-size (5-10 nm in diameter) particles and structures via elliptically-polarized surface-wave scattering. With this approach, the formation of nano particles on a surface can be monitored while the solution chemistry is altered for optimal particle dispersion. This is achieved by measuring the angular profiles of scattered surface waves at different polarization settings. By nature, the surface waves are more sensitive to particles and objects near a thin metallic film; therefore, their scattering patterns allow the detection of nano-size particles more accurately and beyond what the traditional light scattering approaches can achieve. \r\n\r\nThe proposed diagnostic tool is likely to be an important and integral part of many nano-fabrication techniques, which are projected to grow significantly over the next several decades. Applications of such a tool will be numerous, and will include as diverse research areas as electronics, bulk material fabrication, membrane synthesis, nano-mechanical systems, as well as DNA screening. This technique will allow the construction of powerful on-line diagnostic tools, which may be used for real time feedback control of self-assembled nanostructures, and may provide a much less expensive alternative to the traditional electron and atomic-force microscopy measurements. This research project is likely to have a significant indirect impact on the society at large, as it will be instrumental in reducing the costs and improving the reliability of nanoparticle-based devices, tools and manufacturing applications.\r\n",
