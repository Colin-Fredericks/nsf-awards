SDR methodology has a brief but striking record of success, \r\nalthough its inferential foundations are relatively narrow and the restriction \r\nto linear reductions can be limiting in some applications.  The investigators \r\nand their co-authors expand the inferential foundations of SDR through the \r\ndevelopment of optimal methods within the context of linear reduction and the \r\nstudy of new nonlinear reduction methods.  The new optimal reduction methods \r\npermit the investigators to derive model-free tests of conditional independence, \r\nwhich are roughly data-analytic equivalents of t-tests on coefficients in model-\r\nbased linear regression.  They emphasize bioinformatics applications in general \r\nand the analysis of data from high-throughput genomic technologies in \r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nThe computer revolution has produced an unprecedented capacity for data \r\ngeneration, processing and storage, with the consequence that data reduction is \r\nparamount in many research areas and business applications.  For instance, \r\ngenomic technology can produce measurements for thousands of genes across \r\nmultiple tissue samples, and WalMart makes over 20 million transactions daily. \r\nThe development of diagnostics for breast cancer based on fine needle aspiration \r\ncan involve the study of numerous measurements on extracted cells across \r\nhundreds of patients. In response to this proliferation of information, the \r\ninvestigators and their colleagues study methods for reducing data to \r\nan essential core. Their approach is unique because their overarching goal \r\nis reduction without loss of information on the issues under consideration.  \r\nIn the development of diagnostics for breast cancer, this goal translates \r\ninto reducing numerous cell measurements to an index that can be used to \r\nclassify a breast mass as malignant or benign without loss of information, \r\nallowing the physician to present a more informed recommendation to the patient.\r\n",
