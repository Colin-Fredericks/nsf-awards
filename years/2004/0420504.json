 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to the University of Texas at El Paso, under the direction of Dr. Lisa Bain, for support of instrumentation to determine altered gene expression in a variety of organisms in response to different ecological and physiological variables. Understanding what genes are changed helps to better characterize effects on organismal functions such as reproduction, growth, and development, and how these alterations will ultimately affect the organism, population, or community as a whole.  The equipment requested includes an automated microarrayer and an array reader/scanner, plus the analysis software. While commercially available microarrays for human or mouse genes exist, these types of arrays are not available in alternative model species, including many microorganisms, fish, and snakes, as well as genes for targeted applications, such as neurobiology.  Therefore, a microarray spotter and reader are necessary for the custom construction and analysis of these types of microarrays.\r\n\r\nUses of the proposed equipment would include training in bioinformatics courses and research in ecology, microbiology, physiology, endocrinology, and neurobiology.  For example, studies attempting to discern the mechanisms of osmoregulation and adaptation to other environmental pressures in two estuarine fish species, using both custom-made arrays and in collaboration with the Genipol project in Europe. Rattlesnake venom and other toxins are being investigated to how understand how snake venom toxin composition may reflect evolutionary species distribution.  Other investigators are collaborating on the genome project for the protist Giardia, examining how a different microorganism, Bacillus subtilis, controls sporulation, and what genes confer chlorine resistance to mycobacteria and enterohemoragic E. coli O157:H7.  In terms of endocrinology and neurobiology, several investigators are examining gene expression changes in mammary glands following exposure estradiol and estrogen receptor antagonists.   In addition, several of the co-investigators are developing statistical methodology for identifying genes that best discriminate the different groups among individual, as well as developing a curriculum in bioinformatics with more hands-on emphasis on microarray methods in post-genomic analysis. \r\n\r\nThe University of Texas at El Paso is a minority-serving institution for approximately 18,500 students (including 3,500 graduate students), of which 75% are of Hispanic descent. Because of the high percentage of minority students and its location on the US-Mexico border, UTEP is a national leader in the education and training of Hispanic scientists.  Support of this grant will be used to train a number of post-doctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduate students on research using the instrumentation. Hand-on training will occur specifically in our Post-Genomic Analysis class, with the students conducting a complete, hands-on array experiment from start to finish, while two other classes will make use of already scanned arrays, performing statistical analysis and interpretation of data sets.  With access to this state-of-the-art instrumentation, UTEP will produce well-trained students capable of serving the science needs of the region and the nation. \r\n\r\n",
