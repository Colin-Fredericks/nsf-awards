 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main focus of the present proposal is the study of representations\r\nand cohomology of EI-categories - that is, categories all of whose\r\nendomorphisms are isomorphisms. The motivations for this proposal have\r\ntheir roots in long standing conjectures in modular representation theory as\r\nwell as open problems in the homotopy theory of p-local groups, a certain\r\ntype of p-complete topological spaces whose homotopy theory has been\r\ndeveloped in work by Broto, Levi and Oliver.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator has recently shown that one of the most\r\nwell-known conjectures in modular representation theory, Alperin's weight\r\nconjecture, (which is originally a numerical equality involving the number of \r\nsimple modules of a p-block of a finite group), has a structural\r\nreformulation in terms of the cohomology of a certain functor on a suitable\r\nEI-category.  \r\n\r\nOne of the directions the principal investigator proposes to explore is\r\nthat there should be similar structural results - exploiting work of\r\nG. R. Robinson - regarding Dade's conjectures (which are, very roughly,\r\nrefinements of Alperin's weight conjecture taking into account more\r\nsubtle invariants of characters). The problem is to find the ``right\"\r\nEI-category.\r\n\r\nTwo important open problems in block theory can be formulated in a\r\ncompletely general way as ``gluing problems\" of 2-cocycles of certain functors on\r\nappropriate categories: the question whether one can associate a\r\nclassifying space with each p-block and the question whether the K\"ulshammer-Puig\r\n2-cocycles on automorphism groups of centric subgroups of a block are\r\nthe restrictions of a 2-cocycle defined on the fusion system of the\r\nblock.\r\nAnother recent result of the principal investigator is that there is\r\na spectral sequence relating the cohomology of a functor\r\non a regular EI-category to the cohomology of functors on the poset of\r\nisomorphism classes of objects of that category.\r\nThis spectral sequence should be useful for addressing\r\nthe two mentioned gluing problems; this\r\nis another direction the principal investigator proposes to take. \r\n\r\n                                   \r\n\r\nOne way to look at a - not even necessarily mathematical - object is to\r\nconsider all maps of that object to itself which preserve its\r\nstructure (the group of its \"symmetries\") and deduce from those \r\nmaps properties of the considered object -\r\nthis is, in a very simplified way, the general principle of\r\nrepresentation\r\ntheory. \r\n",
