 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Alliance for Graduate Education in Mississippi (AGEM) proposes to \r\ncontinue and expand its comprehensive, state-wide consortial program for enhancing the entry \r\ninto and successful completion of minority students in STEM1 graduate programs.  AGEM will \r\ncontinue to be led by the University of Mississippi (UM) and will involve the three other Ph.D. \r\ngranting universities in the state2 and informal partnerships with several regional colleges \r\n(including several HBCUs3).  The program will build upon the solid accomplishments of the first \r\nround of funding and on the record of collaboration between institutions.  Because the population \r\nof Mississippi is 37% African-American and because there are several HBCUs in this region, a \r\nprimary focus of AGEM is the training of African-American graduate students, with an emphasis \r\non preparing these students for academic careers in STEM areas.  UM has made a major \r\ncommitment to increasing the access of its graduate programs to minority students.  UM, \r\nworking with its partnering institutions, has aligned resources and has coordinated the current \r\npartnership to create a comprehensive approach to the recruitment, mentoring, retention, and \r\ndegree completion of minority students, with counseling aimed at encouraging academic careers. \r\nThus the entire program addresses the broader impacts imperative of the NSF AGEP program.   \r\n  \r\nThe specific goal of the first five-year grant was to triple the number of minority students \r\nwho received STEM doctoral degrees (triple, as compared to the previous five-year baseline) \r\nfrom the four doctoral-degree granting institutions in the state.  From our baseline of 13 minority \r\nSTEM PhDs produced from 1993-1997, the AGEM program has seen an increase to 48 minority \r\nSTEM doctoral graduates produced from 1998-2003.  Another goal of the AGEM program was \r\nto bring about a systemic change in attitudes of faculty, administrators, and students with regard \r\nto minority pipeline issues.  Evidence is presented for such systemic changes.  The current five-\r\nyear program has made a significant start toward enhancing minority student success in STEM \r\ngraduate education.  Continuation of the mission is imperative.  A thorough analysis of \r\nprogrammatic successes, as well as an analysis of those academic disciplines where more can be \r\ndone, has been conducted.  New strategies will be presented to address targeted areas. \r\n \r\n The intellectual merit criterion of NSF is met via the research produced by the students \r\nas they pursue their degrees, by the future research produced by these doctorates when they enter \r\nthe professoriate or other research positions, and by our studies of the factors that lead to success \r\nfor underrepresented minorities.",
