 "awd_abstract_narration": "INTELLECTUAL MERIT:  This Communicating Research to Public Audiences project from the University of South Carolina (USC) is based on the ongoing multidisciplinary investigations of Eugene Karabanov and Douglas Williams (OPP-0229737) in the Russian Arctic.  The scientific objective of the 2003 expedition was to reconstruct the variability of freshwater discharge and terrestrial carbon flux to the Artic Ocean from the Lena River during the last 500 to 1,000 years, improving understanding of the impact of climate change.  As part of that undertaking, the team collected broadcast quality digital video.  This project will interpret the research findings and documentation through collaboration with EdVenture Children's Museum (ECM) in Columbia, South Carolina.  Deliverables will include:  Meet-the-Arctic Scientist programs; Artic Discovery Weekends; Arctic Discovery Boxes (three hands-on units); and Arctic CyberLoft Experiences.  Content will include the role of the Arctic in global climate change; watersheds, fresh water systems and ocean circulation; human adaptations and culture.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT:  The CRPA project will share the results of the research expedition with children and families attending EdVenture through this university-museum partnership.  In addition to visitors from the six-county Midlands area of South Carolina, the project will reach an extended audience through an Arctic Science website at USC with links to the EdVenture site.\r\n",
