 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for the purchase a laser scanning confocal microscope and an automated rotary microtome for tissue preparation. The confocal imaging system will be located in a newly renovated and expanded biological imaging facility where it will be used for faculty and student research and for instruction. Research uses include a group of projects that all require high-resolution 3 dimensional localization of cells and molecules within tissues. These projects include studies of the following: the migration of lymphatic heart myoblasts in amphibian embryos; the progression and origin of a syndrome in drosophila that resembles the human degenerative brain disease spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SC3); the regulation of binding of the microtubule motor protein kinesin to intracellular cargoes; the formation of new brain nerve cells that may enhance cognitive ability of pregnant and nursing rats; the regulation of the flow of oxygen to light-making enzymes in fireflies.  The automated microtome will replace an obsolete 40-year old instrument.  In addition to use in faculty and student research, the microscope will be employed in existing Microanatomy, Developmental Biology, Comparative Anatomy, Principles of Neuroscience, and Neurobiology courses. The microscope is expected to enhance faculty and student research collaborations between psychology and biology departments and strengthen a neuroscience concentration which requires students to perform a year of independent research. The instrument will also be used by students and faculty at Randolph Macon College.  An experienced microscopy technician will direct the imaging facility, maintain the confocal microscope and other imaging equipment, train new users, and assist faculty and students in carrying out their research.\r\n",
