The PI first proposes to undertake a deterministic\r\napproach to the problem of variable parameter selection via the\r\ncoordination of local discrepancy principles and under the assumption\r\nthat some local information about data error-level is available.\r\nParts of this work will entail wavelet-based approximations used in\r\nconjunction with the local regularization ideas. In addition, the PI\r\nplans to study a statistical parameter estimation idea currently being\r\ntested by researchers working on the problem of detecting ozone levels\r\nin the atmosphere, and to give these ideas the theoretical basis they\r\nare currently lacking.  There is hope that powerful new methods for\r\nthe selection of variable local regularization parameters, methods not\r\nrequiring information about local noise-levels in the data, will\r\nemerge from this work.  As part of the project the PI plans to apply\r\nthis new class of methods to the ozone detection problem.\r\n\r\nInverse problems occur widely in many applications, including problems\r\nof biomedical imaging (CT scans and X-rays), image reconstruction\r\n(from satellites or other sources), the detection of ozone levels in\r\nthe atmosphere, and geophysical exploration.  While classical methods\r\nexist for for solving such problems, classical methods are often very\r\ninefficient and lead to overly expensive solution techniques.  A\r\nsecond disadvantage of classical solution methods can be seen in\r\nimaging applications where reconstructed images may have blurred edges\r\nand inadequately detailed features.  The PI has been working to\r\naddress these difficulties with the development of new solution\r\nmethods based on the ideas of local regularization. The use of these\r\nnewer methods can lead to a significant decrease in cost for the\r\nsolution of a wide class of practical inverse problems, with improved\r\nresolution of detailed features of solutions.\r\n\r\n",
