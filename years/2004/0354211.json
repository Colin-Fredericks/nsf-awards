 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal for theoretical and computational work has two components, both related\r\nto the properties of cold atoms. The goal of the first part is to extend our understanding\r\nof phase correlations in Bose condensates at zero temperature to double (and eventually\r\nmultiple) well configurations. The objective is to learn to what extent phase correlation persists\r\nthrough a barrier, as a function of barrier height, atom number, and interactions. \r\nThe second part addresses a bottleneck in attempts to produce electronically, vibrationally,\r\nrotationally and translationally cold molecules by starting with cold atoms. Namely,\r\neven if the multiple lasers can be assembled and stabilized, the intermediate frequencies are\r\nnot known for many alkali diatomics because the molecular structure, being highly perturbed,\r\nhas not been analyzed. RbCs is of especial interest because both atoms can be\r\nefficiently cooled with laser light, and because there are presently efforts at Yale to produce\r\nultracold ground state RbCs molecules. We have assisted in this effort by providing\r\ninformation on the lowest excited states from our recent analysis of RbCs spectral data.\r\n",
