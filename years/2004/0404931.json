 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to study a variety of problems concerning \r\nthe Whitham equations, which describe the macroscopic structure of nonlinear \r\ndispersive oscillations. In particular, the proposers will study (1) Whitham \r\nequations  for the KdV hierarchy, (2) Large time behavior of the Whitham solution \r\nfor the defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation, and (3) Whitham dynamics \r\nin equilibrium measures and random matrices. The primary goal of the first project\r\nis to understand the effect of the hyperbolic degeneracy of the Whitham equations on \r\nthe nonlinear dispersive oscillations. The basic interest of the second project is in the \r\nlarge time behavior of the oscillations generated by the defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation. The purpose of the third project is to study phase transition phenomena in equilibrium measures and random matrices. The proposed methods will be bothanalytical and computational.\r\n\r\nMany wave dynamics in nature undergo dispersive processes, while the dissipative or \r\ndiffusive mechanisms are negligible. Examples include magneto-hydrodynamic waves in \r\nplasmas and various nonlinear waves in optics. When the dispersive term is small, \r\nthere appear regions in space-time which are filled with small scale oscillations. \r\nSuch phenomena have been observed as collisionless shock in plasmas and optical shocks in optical fibers. A general description of these nonlinear dispersive oscillations\r\nhas not been accomplished. The main purpose of this proposal is to develop a precise \r\nmathematical analysis to study those oscillations. The basic equation to describe those \r\nphenomena is so-called the Whitham equations, which also play an essential role in both zero dispersion limit and modulation theories of nonlinear dispersive oscillations.\r\nNonlinear dispersive waves also have physical applications in the transmission and compression of pulses in optical fibers. The Whitham dynamics in equilibrium measures and random matrices have been found to be intrinsically connected to orthogonal polynomials in approximation theory and the Seiberg-Witten solution of suppersymmetric Yang-Mills theory in high-energy physics. The program combines research and education by involving graduate students, postdocs and faculty in the area of Applied Mathematics and Applied Sciences.\r\n",
