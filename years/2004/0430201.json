 "awd_abstract_narration": "Communication networks are critically important in the\r\ndissemination of information in today's technological\r\nsociety.  Several academic disciplines have undertaken\r\nthe study of various aspects of their operation, but\r\nan integrated theory of networking has been elusive.\r\nThe objective of network optimization theory is to\r\nmost effectively use network resources, but recent\r\nwork in network coding has demonstrated that a standard\r\nassumption of flow conservation from this theory has\r\nimposed artificial restrictions on the workings of\r\ncommunication networks.  Network information theory\r\nconsiders more general models of communication and\r\noffers some bound on the limits of information transfer\r\nin a communication system involving multiple senders\r\nand receivers.\r\n\r\nThis research fuses aspects of network optimization\r\ntheory and network information theory in order to find\r\nand specify new limits of information transfer across\r\na communication network.  The investigators use the\r\ntwo-way channel from information theory as a general\r\nmodel of the transmission medium between neighboring\r\nprocessors of a communication network and address\r\nfundamental optimization problems pertaining to the\r\nanalysis and design of networks of two-way channels.\r\nThe investigators seek optimal routing algorithms in\r\nmulticast settings and a broad classification of\r\nsituations where network coding can or cannot improve\r\nupon routing.  The investigators further aim to\r\ncategorize network scenarios in which a bidirected\r\ncut set bound derived using information theoretic\r\narguments is tight and to explore a network information\r\ncounterpart to Kirchoff's law when the bidirected\r\ncut set bound is not tight.  The research also\r\ninvolves extending the notion of minimal cost flow\r\nas an initial approach to treating quality-of-service\r\nissues and devising networks with least cost or\r\ncapacity that meet requirements on information transfer.\r\n",
