 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to identify specific research needs with respect to the adequate representation of climate change uncertainties and the development of decision criteria and analytical tools for decision making in the face of these uncertainties, with particular emphasis on the formulation of adaptation and mitigation responses to climate change.  This will be accomplished by organizing two workshops covering some important aspects of decision making in relation to climate change, viewed from both normative and positive perspectives.  One workshop, Decision Making Under Uncertainty, will examine alternative approaches to the representation of uncertainty and alternative criteria for decision making under uncertainty considered from a variety of perspectives, both theoretical and empirical, including economics, psychology, and risk communication.  The theoretical section of the workshop will bring together leading economic theorists; the empirical section of the workshop will focus on the meaningfulness to decision makers of alternative approaches to the representation of uncertainty and alternative criteria for decision making under uncertainty and their practicality in the context of the climate uncertainties and hydrology uncertainties at various different temporal and/or spatial scales.  The second workshop, The Precautionary Principle in Climate Change Policy, explores the implications of recent economic research on the nature and significance of the irreversibility effect for the design and climate change policy.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of the existing analyses of climate change are deterministic rather probabilistic in nature and concentrate on changes in mean temperature and precipitation.  However, there is growing recognition among climate researchers of the need for analyses that account for changes in the variability of temperature and precipitation, some of which are likely to be felt in the near-term.  These workshops will further the development of decision analytic tools that incorporate climate variability and uncertainty and therefore help public and private decision makers to address issues of adaptation and mitigation in the face of climate change.  The proceedings of the two workshops will be posted on a web site and manuscripts will be prepared for peer-reviewed journals.  This developmental award was supported as part of the Fiscal Year 2003 Human and Social Dynamics priority area special competition on Decision Making Under Uncertainty (DMUU).",
