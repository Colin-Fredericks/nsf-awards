 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Pamela O'Neil at the University of New Orleans to develop an undergraduate research program designed to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in environmental biology.  There are several specific goals of the proposed program.  First, we would like to expose students from underrepresented groups at UNO to a broad range of approaches to environmental biology so that they are aware of the diversity of opportunities that are available.  Second, we will provide a diversity of role models that the students will be exposed to in settings that are less formal than students experience in a classroom.  Third, we will provide a stepwise developmental experience lasting two or more years that is structured to build confidence.  The Undergraduate Mentoring in Environmental Biology (UMEB) award will allow us to meet all 3 goals and to provide a unique research training experience in environmental biology.\r\n\r\nThe student experience will include a first year introductory seminar designed to expose students to a broad range of possible research experiences, role models, and approaches to doing science as well as a Research Tools course designed to provide a basic toolbox necessary for any research experience.  The second year of the program students will become directly involved in an independent research project and will also participate in weekly group meetings with UMEB advisors, graduate students and undergraduate researchers. After completing the research year, UMEB participants will present their results in both oral and written format.  An optional third year of the program will allow exceptional students who wish to continue to do research in the same area or a different area to be able to continue at an advanced level. Our ultimate goal is to increase the number of students from under-represented groups pursuing careers in environmental biology by preparing students for graduate school.\r\n\r\nThe research theme of our UMEB program is centered on conservation biology.  The Biology Department at UNO has a Ph.D. program in conservation biology and a concentration of faculty who are conducting research in this or closely related areas.  The research expertise of our mentors includes conservation genetics, conservation ecology, population biology, ecosystem ecology, physiological ecology, and molecular approaches to environmental biology.  The proposed UMEB program is expected to have clear broader impacts of training under-represented minorities as well as intellectual merit in the high quality research that will result.  \r\n\r\n",
