 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to develop a new combinatorial and\r\nprobabilistic approach to geometric functional analysis and its\r\napplications. Some of new major ideas are expected to come from the\r\nconcept of the combinatorial dimension, which is a general form of the\r\nclassical Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension. Arising from logic, probability\r\ntheory and computer science, the use of the combinatorial dimension\r\nlooks very promising also in a wide range of areas including geometric\r\nfunctional analysis (finding nice sections of convex bodies), convex\r\ngeometry (study of polytopes), discrete geometry (counting integer\r\npoints and cells in sets) and extremal combinatorics. This new\r\ncombinatorial and probabilistic method is aimed at one of the hardest\r\nproblems in the theory of empirical processes - describe the classes of\r\nfunctions for which the Central Limit Theorem holds uniformly. New\r\naspects of the celebrated concentration of measure phenomenon will also\r\nbe studied by a combination of probabilistic and purely geometric ideas.\r\nThis might give an insight into relationships between random and\r\ndeterministic structures in geometric functional analysis, as well as a\r\nnew view of local versus global asymptotic convex geometries.\r\nProbabilistic approach will also be developed for problems of finding\r\nnice submatrices of large matrices, which arise in functional and\r\nharmonic analysis as well as in computer science.\r\n\r\nThe project opens new connections between functional analysis,\r\ncombinatorics, probability, convex geometry and applied mathematics. The\r\ncelebrated \"probabilistic method\" along with deterministic\r\ncombinatorial, geometric and analytic methods will merge into one\r\nmachinery, which may expand our knowledge on the\r\nrelationships between chaos and pattern that arise in a variety of\r\nhigh-dimensional structures in pure mathematics and in computer science.\r\n From the practical point of view, the results expected from this machinery\r\ninclude justification of algorithms in machine learning, development of\r\nalgorithms for storage of large amounts of data and for data\r\ntransmission (such as error correction codes).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
