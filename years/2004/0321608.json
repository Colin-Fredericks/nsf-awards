 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop the Liquid Phase Epitaxy (LPE) of potassium  tantalum niobate (KTN) on a cubic perovskite substrate. In this manner both components of the  film/substrate composite may be optimized for device performance. KTN has almost two orders  of magnitude higher electrooptic coefficients than current generation lithium niobate waveguides,  which would permit shorter path lengths, lower bias voltages or some combination of the two. The new, low dielectric constant substrate material developed in Phase I will enable better  matching of the effective microwave dielectric constant to the optical dielectric constant of the  film material and achieve lower bias fields. In Phase II, the researchers will develop the new  substrate material to commercial quality and size. LPE of KTN will be developed from a new  innovative flux system that allows excellent control of growth and superior film properties. Both  film and substrate will be fully characterized and optimized as a composite. The process and  product will be scaled up to full commercial size. IPI will interact with strategic partner device  manufacturers to optimize the material and realize device applications. \r\n\r\nElectrooptic devices are used in any photonics application where an electrical signal can be used  to change the state of a beam of light. While the best-known applications for electrooptic devices  are in telecommunications, customers can be found wherever light is used to move information  including optical computing, analog and digital signal processing, information processing and  sensing. Devices include phase and amplitude modulators, Q-switches, multiplexers, switch  arrays, couplers, polarization controllers, deflectors, correlators, sensors, potential transformers  and optical parametric oscillators. Potential customers are noticeably found in both the electric  power industry and the military. Initial applications in sensors will have an immediate potential  for impact in reliability of electric power distribution through failure anticipation and prevention  and conservation of electric power through monitoring and control. The proposed work will  enable electrooptic modulators, switches and innovative new photonic device applications with  lower costs, smaller footprints and lower power budgets. All this contributes to improvements of  the infrastructure of the Internet and more rapid, lower cost deployment, especially in the local  loop.",
