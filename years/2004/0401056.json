 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT for Award DMS-0401056 of Pop\r\n\r\nThe present research project concerns modern Galois Theory,\r\nmore specifically birational Anabelian Geometry. The main\r\nproblem I will be investigating is trying to recover the\r\nbirational class of a variety (over an algebraically closed\r\nbase field) from the pro-l Galois theory of its function field.\r\nRelated to this, there are several other questions, like the\r\none by Ihara/Oda-Matsumoto concerning a geometric/combinatoric\r\ndescription of the Galois group of the field of rational numbers.\r\nThe above question is also related to describing rational points\r\nof varieties via the so called Section Conjecture. This kind of\r\nquestions were initiated -in the arithmetic situation- in some\r\nremarkable (unpublished) manuscripts by Grothendieck. But it\r\nappears that in higher dimensions, one has such \"anabelian\r\nphenomena\" even in the total absence of arithmetic, i.e., over\r\nan algebraically closed base field.\r\n\r\nThe Galois Theory makes a bridge between two very different\r\nmathematical aspects, namely some basic algebraic objects, like\r\nfields, or more general spaces (varieties) on the one side,\r\nand the way one solves algebraic equations, or constructs\r\ncovers of the spaces in discussion, on the other side. Now the\r\n(birational) Anabelian Geometry asserts that in the case the field\r\none works over is \"primitive enough\", respectively the geometry\r\nof the space one constructs covers of, is \"complicated enough\", the\r\ntotality of the \"recipes\" of solving all the algebraic equations,\r\nrespectively of constructing all the covers, encodes the field,\r\nrespectively the space under discussion. This opens a completely\r\nnew perspective in approaching some very fundamental mathematical\r\nquestions. The present research project addresses some of the basic\r\nproblems in this mathematical field of research.\r\n",
