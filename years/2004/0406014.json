 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the project is to probe the dissipation\r\nmechanism in viscous approximation of multidimensional compressible\r\npotential flow by studying the regularity property, positivity of density,\r\nand dynamics of convective singularity surfaces, to justify the relation\r\nbetween variety of plate theories and three dimensional elasticity theory by\r\nderiving the asymptotic limit of three dimensional nonlinear elasticity,\r\nto deepen the understanding of optimal transport mechanism in\r\nnon-turbulent semi-geostrophic equations, to investigate evolution of\r\ninterface in multi-phase crystal growth in material science, stochastic\r\nsolutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations which model many interesting\r\nphysical processes such as front propagation in combustion.\r\n    Rigorous mathematics in the study of the nonlinear partial\r\ndifferential equtions addressed in the project make it possible both to\r\nconduct stable numerical computation in, and to understand the qualitative\r\nfeatures of the phenomena addressed above. One of our objectives is to\r\nstudy viscous oompressible potential flow and semi-geostrophic flow. The\r\nadvance in the knowledge of global large solutions of mathematical\r\nequations has important impact on our fundamental understanding of air\r\nflow. The second objective is to analyze the front propagation of crystal\r\ngrowth and thin-film blistering in the semiconducting materials from which\r\ncomputing devices are manufactured. The third objective of this project is\r\nthe training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the\r\nmathematical analysis of applied problems.\r\n",
