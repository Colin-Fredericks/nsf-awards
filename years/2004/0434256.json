 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to the University of Washington, under the direction of Dr. Dennis WIllows to provide funds to replace microscopes for laboratory investigations, and an outboard powered skiff for nearshore and intertidal fieldwork at the Friday Harbor Laboratory (FHL). The microscopes are needed to maintain the basic research and teaching infrastructure, and the boat will replace one that is decrepit and unusable. FHL is located at the junction of Juan de Fuca and Georgia Straits and Puget Sound, at a site of unusual biological diversity and opportunities for coastal ocean studies. FHL supports research from molecular and cell biology along a scale of increasing spatial dimensions to animal behavior and community ecology.  It has traditionally encouraged innovative and cross-cutting original research by eminent scholars, researchers, and students in a wide range of fields including zoology, oceanography, botany, and basic biomedical sciences.  With help from this request, they hope to establish and sustain for at least 3 decades, opportunities for research and training for students and investigators from culturally diverse, national and international institutions in the marine sciences.",
