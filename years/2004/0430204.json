This work involves designing a novel distributed routing Intrusion Detection System (Router IDS) for performing real-time routing anomaly detection and mitigation.  The Router IDS detects routing anomalies by combining publicly available routing data from multiple vantage points to check consistency and identify deviations from past routing behavior.  It disambiguates uncertainties by correlating routing data with both passively collected traffic data as well as actively triggered lightweight probe packets.  In response to detected routing anomalies, routing policies are modified or the suspicious routing updates are filtered.  Overlay routing can also be used to bypass the router using the incorrect route.\r\nThis project is building a prototype to test the effectiveness of the detection and mitigation algorithms.  The prototype can be deployed at any network domain to achieve protection from external routing anomalies.  The project involves ongoing collaboration with researchers at research labs, industry, and the operator community, in order to provide practical insights.\r\n\r\n",
