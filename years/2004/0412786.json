 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation research project will elaborate upon three processes related to how people in Montreal, Quebec, think about language: how local nationalist and multicultural interests authorize certain linguistic beliefs and practices; how these political interests impact the formation of language ideologies; and how points of conflict or opposition are involved in the development of dominant language ideologies and the socialization of minority citizens.  Each of these processes will be examined within the context of the Programme d'Enseignement des Langues d'Origine, or PELO. This is a state-funded program designed to teach spoken \"heritage\" languages to children of immigrants and their descendants.  By using a variety of ethnographic, linguistic, and historical methods, the student will investigate the ideological impact of one Tamil PELO program on the beliefs and linguistic practices of Tamil-speaking children and adults. \r\n\r\nThis project differs from other studies on Quebec's language issues because it directly examines how multilingualism, multicultural agendas, and nationalist policies have influenced Montreal residents' ideas about language.  In doing so, this project will account for universal and culturally specific features of language in society.  Furthermore, by investigating the salient differences in language use and ideology that result from the institutional mediation of Tamil citizenship, this project will contribute to a broader understanding of transnational subjects.    \t\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:  In addition to contributing to the doctoral education of a linguistic anthropologist, this project will further our understanding of language use and ideology as integral components of teaching and national policy-making.  The collaboration with teachers, administrators, and school commission officials throughout the research process will foster new interactions between the academic research institution, educational institutions, and the government.  \r\n",
