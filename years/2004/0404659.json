 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nIntellectual Merit \r\nThis planning grant project for a National Center builds on a local project that\r\n-Developed competencies for aircraft electronics specialty fields with over 100 employers. \r\n-Developed curriculum for three of ten courses in the Avionics field. \r\n-Developed select simulations of aircraft electrical systems, offering low-cost access to instructional technology. \r\n-Field-tested curriculum and instructional materials with incumbent technicians and traditional students in Florida, Texas and Minnesota. \r\n-Hosted a National Conference involving 100 educators, employers and government to examine efforts to improve standards and curriculum and to build commitment to a national learning agenda to be carried out by a National Center of Excellence.   \r\n-Established an online collegial network of technician educators nationwide. \r\n-Established contracts to place interns at numerous corporate flight departments. \r\n \r\nDuring the planning grant the consortium is:  \r\n-Formalizing a partnership to leverage the expertise, experience and products of the Canadian Aviation Maintenance Council (CAMC), a Center of Excellence in Canada. \r\n-Establishing procedures to refine CAMC's national standards, curriculum, certification and accreditation procedures for U.S. Avionics Technicians. \r\n-Designing a training program to elevate faculty members' skills to the national standard. \r\n-Securing donations of electronic simulations of instructional technologies to make delivery of the training program financially feasible. \r\nDeveloping a strategy to use and expand the Technician Educators' Collegial Network. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts \r\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has regulated the education and certification of U.S. Airframe and Powerplant (A&P) Technicians for decades. However, as aircraft have become increasingly electronics driven, a career path has evolved for technicians specializing in troubleshooting, maintenance and repair of aircraft electrical and integrated flight systems. National standards, curricula and regulatory oversight presently do not exist for Avionics Technicians.  While the FAA recognizes this gap, it has not filled it.  Industry, labor and education have come together, with participation and support from the FAA, to fill this void in an effort to meet the workforce development needs of aircraft manufacturers, component manufacturers, airlines, and repair stations throughout the United States. \r\n \r\n\r\n",
