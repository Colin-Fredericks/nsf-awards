 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is identifying the knowledge and skills necessary to increase our technical and environmental awareness of energy issues and to improve the implementation of project-based energy and environment curricula in K-16 classrooms, particularly in New York State. There are two primary components of the project: 1) interdisciplinary PhD research that is defining the intersection between technical and environmental literacy related to energy issues and the means of improving the integration of the latest research findings into communication materials to improve our literacy and 2) the use of this research work for a range of activities that result in the preparation, assessment and\r\ndissemination of project-based educational materials for K-16 classrooms. Teacher workshops are being conducted to disseminate the curricular materials. In addition, two posters that capture the key concepts defined by the research component are being widely\r\ndisseminated to increase the use of the materials. \r\n\r\nWorkshops are also being conducted for college faculty to expand their interest and capabilities in providing effective K-12 outreach in a manner that is valued by academic institutions. \r\n\r\nDissemination and assessment activities are planned for each component of this award. Surveys, evaluation forms, and traditional measures of assessing the quality and quantity of research will be employed.\r\n",
