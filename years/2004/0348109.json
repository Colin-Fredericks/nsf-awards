 "awd_abstract_narration": "0348109\r\n\r\nThe need to analyze and design broadband wireless systems and control electromagnetic interference increases with each passing year.  Though many computational electromagnetics (CEM) techniques already exist that in principle can tackle such problems, none is efficient and accurate for large problems involving broad bandwidths and complex geometries.  Under this grant, a new CEM technique called accurate marching by band-limited extrapolation (AMBLE) will be created for the analysis of modern electromagnetic devices, scattering problems, and electromagnetic compatibility concerns.  Based on time-domain integral equations (TDIEs), AMBLE will overcome the stability and accuracy difficulties of past TDIE approaches using a novel combination of noncausal, band-limited temporal basis functions and band-limited extrapolation techniques designed to recover causality.  AMBLE will be applied to problems involving moving media, dielectric media, layered media, dispersive media, and reduced dimensionality, as well as extended to work with the Nystrom method instead of the typical Galerkin discretization.  The resulting engine will form the basis of a new virtual laboratory to be used in the electromagnetics classes at the University of Delaware, and for outreach to high school students and the Girl Scouts of America.\r\n\r\n",
