 "awd_abstract_narration": "0339971\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proposes to develop an adaptive \r\nCMOS image sensor that estimates and largely eliminates illumination variations in sensed \r\noptical images thus reporting electronic images that are indicative of the reflectance of the \r\nviewed scene. Most present and future vision applications including automotive, biometric, \r\nsecurity, and mobile computing applications operate in unconstrained environments and have to \r\ncope with unknown and widely varying illumination conditions.  The proposed research has a potential to broadly impact computer vision performance and reliability.  The core innovation is in a signal processing technique for estimating the illumination field from sensed images.  The technique efficiently implements as a dense on-chip massively parallel analog processor distributed among the photodetectors to produce a reflectance sensitive image sensor.\r\n\r\nImage sensors are rapidly finding their way into cars, cell-phones, personal digital \r\nassistants, medical and diagnostic equipment, automated drug discovery, cutting edge security, \r\nsurveillance and biometric systems.  To fully realize the potential of electronic imaging in \r\nsociety, the image sensors will need to adapt and provide useful images most of the time even \r\nunder the harshest of illumination conditions.  The proposed research will make this possible and \r\nmake people.s lives safer, more productive and more enjoyable.",
