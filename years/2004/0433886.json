 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abiotic Mobilization of Arsenic in Bangladesh Groundwater Aquifers?\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nMillions of people consuming groundwater in Bangladesh and other affected South Asian\r\ncountries are exposed to As levels that are predicted to cause death and disease in the coming\r\ndecades. The sequence of steps that leads to elevated groundwater As concentrations in these\r\nregions remains poorly understood, despite intense efforts by scientists throughout the world\r\nover the past several years. This is a serious problem because major policy decisions hinge on\r\naccurate prediction of the impact of groundwater pumping for irrigation on groundwater As\r\nconcentrations. We propose here to explore with a series of simple incubation experiments a\r\nnew mechanism for As accumulation in groundwater that could have important implications for\r\nthe response of shallow Bangladesh aquifers to irrigation.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of spatial patterns of local recharge constrained by 3H-3He dating and\r\ngroundwater As profiles established at four sites in Bangladesh, we propose that weathering of\r\nprimary minerals is the rate-limiting step of As mobilization in shallow aquifers. The available\r\ndata suggest that As release by this process is of similar magnitude across a wide range of\r\nenvironments, relatively insensitive to redox conditions, and therefore possibly entirely abiotic in\r\nnature. The implication is that the distribution of As is determined primarily by spatial variations\r\nin the rate of flushing of shallow aquifers by local recharge. This is a direct challenge to the\r\nwidely-held view that the distribution of As in groundwater is controlled primarily by\r\nmicrobially-mediated reductive dissolution of Fe oxyhydroxides.\r\n\r\nThe available field data indicate a relatively consistent rate of As release of ~20 ug/L per\r\nyear for a wide range of settings. A flux of this magnitude should therefore be detectable\r\ndirectly by isolating freshly collected aquifer material and sampling the groundwater\r\nperiodically. In this pilot-study, we propose to conduct such incubations anaerobically for 18\r\nmonths with aquifer material from 4 depth intervals at a well-documented location. The role of\r\nmicroorganisms in As mobilization will be tested by additions of an antibiotic and acetate,\r\nrespectively. Aquifer material from one depth interval will be subjected to additional treatments\r\nsuch as aerobic incubation and replacement of in situ groundwater with low-As groundwater or\r\npond water. In addition to As concentrations, the major cations Na, Mg, K, and Ca will be\r\nmonitored as indicators of chemical weathering. Redox-sensitive solutes such as Fe, Mn, and S\r\nwill also be measured.\r\n\r\nResults from these simple experiments could lead to a radical change in our\r\nunderstanding of the acquisition of solutes by groundwater in the case of a troublesome\r\nconstituent such as As (NSF Criterion 1). The new understanding derived from this work could\r\ninfluence policies that affect the lives and health of millions of people in South Asia (NSF\r\nCriterion 2). If our new explanation for As accumulation holds, continued irrigation might\r\nactually reduce As concentrations in shallow aquifers over time. This contrasts with the recent\r\nattribution of elevated As levels in Bangladesh groundwater to irrigation.\r\n\r\n",
