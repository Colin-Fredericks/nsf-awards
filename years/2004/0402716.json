 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Focused Research Group award from the Division of Materials Research to Iowa State University is to characterize, understand, and improve upon a new class of magnetostrictive composite material discovered by Professor Jiles and collaborators, who were supported by a previous NSF-sponsored research (DMR-9902415).  Primary thrust of the research would be to investigate both theoretical and experimental ways to enhance response linearity and to reduce hysteresis by exploiting an atomic substitution scheme at appropriate lattice sites in the material to reduce exchange-coupling leading to nonlinear hysteretic effects.  The PIs will explore magnetoelastic composites based on cobalt ferrite in a metallic binder for use as stress sensitive materials in axial and torsional non-contact sensors.  Alloys of cobalt ferrite with Silicon, Manganese and Cobalt (substituting these for the Iron in the ferrite) will be prepared to reduce the Curie temperature to room temperature thereby minimizing undesirable hysteresis. These new class of materials are expected to significantly improve magnetoelastic characteristics over competitive materials. \r\n%%%\r\nThis award could accomplish substantial research experience combined with promotion of teaching, training, and learning both at the graduate and undergraduate levels.  The proposed collaboration with Moravian College, a leading undergraduate institution would be a broadening experience for both institutions and will likely create a synergistic relationship for years to come. A successful outcome of this award could be a significant technology transfer to a number of industries in the use of these stress sensitive materials in axial and torsional non-contact sensors in energy conservation and safety applications\r\n",
