 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will clarify our theoretical and empirical understanding of how and why amicus curiae briefs influence the decision making of Supreme Court justices.  The three goals of this study are to link theoretically amicus curiae participation to the predominant theory of voting on the merits in the Supreme Court, the attitudinal model; to examine the mediating role of ideology as it relates to how amicus briefs influence the decision making of Supreme Court justices; and to systematically determine if amicus briefs influence the decision making of Supreme Court justices and, if so, how much and under what circumstances.  Data will be collected and updated on all amicus curiae filings during the 1946-2001 terms of the Court.  Using rigorous methodological techniques, this study will advance our understanding of interest group strategies and effectiveness, as well as judicial decision-making, two of the enduring concerns of political scientists.   This study will promote a better understanding in academic circles of how amicus briefs influence the decision making of the justices.\r\n\r\n",
