 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator proposes to track deaf children's school, college, and employment success over time by applying profiles of success to both the college admission and career training process at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, the Rochester Institute of Technology, and other institutions.  The researcher would conduct secondary analysis of available data sets to examine math and reading achievement, to specify the success of deaf children in their transition from school to work, and to identify a profile of career success for recent deaf alumni.  The study will contribute to existing knowledge by analyzing existing national survey studies of labor force behavior and a new longitudinal studies of deaf students from New York State that would be collected during the 5-year CAREER project by the investigator.  The results of the research will be adopted in courses the investigator teachers in secondary deaf education teacher-training programs at the Rochester Institute of Technology.  The study has implications for instruction of deaf children.",
