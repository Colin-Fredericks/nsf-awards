 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this project is to understand how biological organisms process signals and how such\r\nan understanding might impinge on the future development of man-made devices.\r\nWe normally associate computation with man-made devices, particularly the ubiquitous digital\r\ncomputer or the lesser-known analog computer. However there are computational devices much\r\ncloser to home. All biological organisms are exposed almost continuously to a huge variety of\r\nenvironmental changes and shocks. In order to survive such changes, living organisms have\r\nevolved sensor proteins located on the outer surface of the organism which can detect all manner\r\nof environmental changes. These sensor proteins are in turn connected to so-called signaling\r\nnetworks composed of interacting proteins inside the cell. These signaling networks are\r\nresponsible to making an appropriate decision based on all the sensory inputs. What is not well\r\nunderstood at this stage is the type of decision processing that is carried out by these networks. In\r\nman made devices we employ a variety of techniques from digital computers to analog devices\r\nto control our machines. Over the last fifty years or so, the design of sophisticated man-made\r\ncontrol devices has matured to the extent that almost all devices now have some kind of control\r\nsystems built into them. The reason why we are so good at designing artificial control systems is\r\nthat we have a thorough grasp of the underlying theoretical principles of control. The primary\r\ntechnology that we used to build control devices is based on electronics. Walk into any book\r\nstore and one will find books on electronic design.\r\nIn relation to biological control systems we do not have the equivalent of an electronics design\r\nhandbook. As a result we understand very little about how biological control systems work, how\r\nthey carry out decisions and what the underlying principles of biological control are. Our\r\napproach is to evolve on digital computers, artificial biological signaling networks. Depending\r\non what task the network is designed to perform, we evolve networks which will come closest to\r\nachieving this objective. Examples include evolving a network which can be robust to sudden\r\nchanges in the environment, or conversely evolving networks which can quickly respond to\r\nenvironmental changes. In addition other objectives will include common signal processing\r\ntechniques employed in electronics, for example we might evolve a network that can oscillate or\r\na network that can carry out some arithmetic. By these means we will generate biological like\r\nnetworks which will have the capacity to carry out all the common electronic signal processing\r\ntasks. The end results will be a large library of networks. From this library we will then reverse\r\nengineer the networks to understand how they accomplish their evolved tasks. Finally we will\r\ncompare these networks to real biological networks to see if we can find equivalent 'designs'.\r\nThe ultimate goal is to write the 'electronics' design manual of biological signaling control\r\nnetworks.\r\nThe work we propose in this application impinges on many areas of science. It combines work\r\nfrom molecular biology, computer science, control theory, evolutionary algorithms, signal\r\nprocessing and electrical circuit theory.\r\nThe engineering sciences will benefit from this work by being able to examine examples of\r\nsignal processing carried out at the molecular level and the biological sciences will benefit by an\r\nunderstanding of the underlying control principles of real biological networks. In addition,\r\nmolecular based circuitry has to deal with noise (which is dealt with extensively in the\r\nengineering sciences), this work may have an important bearing on the implementation of\r\nnanotechnology based control systems.",
