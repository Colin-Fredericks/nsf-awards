 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nA grant has been made to Louisiana State University under the direction of Dr. D. Ferguson to improve the herbarium collections of the Louisiana State University Herbarium [LSU] and the Bernard Lowy Mycological Herbarium [LSUM]. The project includes the: (1) repair and reorganize fungal specimens in LSUM; (2) the addition of remaining US and Canadian vascular plant collections and Louisiana specimens of bryophytes, algae, lichens, and fungi (ca. 60,000 records) to the current database of Louisiana vascular plants; and (3) the revision of the LSU web pages by enhancing search capabilities and accessibility of the database and by linking maps and images.\r\nFungal and bryophyte collections, that are in a serious state of disrepair and at risk for loss, will be placed in archival packaging for better protection, and specimens will be arranged alphabetically within fungal phyla in order to improve access. In addition to repairs and modernization, databasing the Louisiana specimens of fungi, as well as bryophytes, algae, and lichens, is a high priority and those collections will be added to the existing database of over 55,000 records of Louisiana vascular plants. Several upgrades to our web site will make it more accessible to the general public as an educational tool. A browser search will be added to the existing wild card taxon search, allowing users who are less familiar with Latin names to browse through a list.  The collections are fundamental for document Gulf Coast Plain biodiversity, a region that currently is poorly documented and subject to dramatic habitat loss through agriculture, urbanization, and fire abatement. Information from the collections is more important than ever for use by federal, state, and local agencies, students, and the public and private sectors and through the on-line database, will be more accessible. \r\n",
