Techniques used in wired networks are inadequate for analyzing wireless networks since the wireless physical layer affects operation at all protocol layers; moreover, wireless links are variable, error-prone, and affected by external uncontrolled sources.\r\n\r\nThis project is developing a system that accurately emulates wireless signal propagation in a physical space.  The project is also developing realistic signal propagation models, and conducting experiments to see how diverse technologies such as WiFi, Bluetooth, and software defined radios are affected by the physical layer.\r\n\r\nBy combining many benefits of simulation and real world experimentation, the emulator can have a dramatic research impact.  Since the emulator can be shared over the network, it can be integrated into existing testbeds. It can also enable remote groups to compare realistic results.  Moreover, the emulator can aid education by supporting hands-on wireless course projects in a realistic, \"safe\" isolated environment.  Emulator-based experiments will significantly improve understanding of how signal propagation affects medium access control layer performance, and enable the development of improved protocols.  This project will also result in a set of realistic models of signal propagation.  Finally, this project will quantify the relative strengths and weaknesses of competing wireless protocols in diverse, realistically emulated physical environments.  Project results will be disseminated through publications, through allowing remote researchers emulator access, and through educational activities such as course projects.\r\n\r\n",
