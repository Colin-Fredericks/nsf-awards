 "awd_abstract_narration": "The striking abundance of bacteriophage (viruses that infect \r\nbacteria) in the environment has prompted many questions about their \r\necological and evolutionary roles in nature.  Bacteriophage often \r\nkill their bacterial hosts and such viral-caused mortality has been \r\nshown to have important consequences for nutrient cycling and the \r\nmaintenance of biological diversity.  This project will characterize \r\nthe interactions between bacteria that consume nitrate (denitrifying \r\nbacteria) and the bacteriophage that infect these bacteria. \r\nDenitrification is an important process in many natural environments, \r\nas well as in engineered environments such as wastewater treatment \r\nplants.  However, the role of phage in these communities remains \r\npoorly understood.  We will determine 1) whether the interactions \r\nbetween phage and bacteria in this system can be predicted from \r\nearlier studies of much simpler microbial model communities, and 2) \r\nhow interactions between phage and bacteria affect the efficiency and \r\nstability of the denitrification process.  Improved understanding of \r\nthis denitrifying community will lead to improved functional \r\nperformance in engineered environments, as well as a better \r\nunderstanding of the factors influencing the function of natural \r\necosystems.\r\n",
