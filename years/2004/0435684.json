 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics is a visual language that poses major barriers to blind students considering careers in science, engineering, technology or mathematics (STEM). The learning challenges are further attenuated by federal law, parental advocates and educators who seek better tools and techniques. Presently, there is a dwindling supply of teachers properly trained to serve the blind students seeking STEM careers. As a result, there is a spiraling gap between the number of blind students needing training and those adequately trained to provide the requisite instruction.\r\nPhase One of the Project VROOM will produce a workable Math 101 (Introductory Algebra) curriculum under the guidance of an interdisciplinary team mathematicians, engineers, instructional technologists, and special educators. Phase Two will field-test the Math 101 curriculum during a six-week summer workshop for blind high school students. Finally, Phase Three will evaluate the effectiveness of the Math 101 curriculum and disseminate the results to stakeholders concerned about educating blind students. The ultimate project outcome will be the creation of an evidence-based Math 101 curriculum, one that is\r\ntechnologically appropriate for the blind, and ready for further analysis and research. Formative and summative evaluation measures will examine baseline and changes in knowledge and attitude among students and teachers. The formative data will insure the effectiveness of the project during the granting period and allow for any needed course corrections. The summative evaluation will judge the ultimate success of the\r\ncompleted project using both quantitative (test scores) and qualitative measures (focus groups and attitude surveys). Six different dissemination strategies will employ a blend of active/passive and visual/verbal dissemination approaches. The development of Math 101 and its demonstration through a summer mathematics workshop are unique.",
