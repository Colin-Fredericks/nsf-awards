Roberts at Rutgers University and Laboratoire d'Analyse et Modelisation de Systemes pour l'Aide ala Decision (LAMADE), directed by Alexis Tsoukias at the University of Paris IX propose to investigate modern computer science applications of methods developed by decision theorists, in particular, methods involving consensus and associated order relations. The goals are to explore connections between computer science and decision theory, develop new decision-theory based methodologies, and investigate applications\r\nto computer science and to the social sciences.  Exchange visits of graduate students and junior researchers and several workshops will introduce a broader community to the topics of the collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe project will advance understanding of computer science problems that arise in the following areas:  (1) metasearches (combining the outputs of several search engines); (2) collaborative filtering (learning algorithms for books, movie recommendations);  (3) locating centrally placed items in large databases (biological databases and others with homeland security applications); (4) finding efficient ways to compute consensus\r\nfunctions; and (5) learning about individuals' preferences revealed gradually in economic cooperation and competition using the Internet.  Computer science applications to improve the methods of decision theory and apply new ideas to decision making in the social sciences will also be investigated.\r\n\r\nThe project is jointly supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS).  NSF provides support for visits to France by the U.S. investigators and students.  The CNRS covers the cost of travel to the United States by the French investigators.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
