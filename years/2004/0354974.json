It will take place at the Benasque Center for Science in Spain from July 25-August 13,2004. The funds will be used entirely to support graduate students, Post-docs and junior faculty who otherwise could not afford to attend the workshop.  The conference will cover recent progress made in effective field theory in making contact between lattice QCD and experiment.  The workshop will involve scientists in both the particle theory and nuclear theory communities and is a spin off of a three-month program held at the Institute for Nuclear Theory. There will be a mix of 50 participants from the Lattice QCD, chiral dynamics, hadron phenomenology and nuclear theory communities.  The main purpose is to stimulate interactions between experts in different subfields and to help junior participants to form a 'big picture' understanding of the issues involved in connecting lattice QCD calculations to experimental data. The broader issue is to get a better understanding of both the particle and nuclear physics aspects of QCD. \r\n",
