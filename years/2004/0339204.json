 "awd_abstract_narration": "Do older and younger adults differ in how they process information?  Do they make systematically different decisions as a result?  How can we help older adults make better decisions?  The aim of the proposed research is to examine adult age differences in affective (feeling-based) and deliberative (thought-based) information processes in order to understand how such dual information processing might impact judgments and decisions.  Five experiments will be conducted to study whether older adults may react more to and learn more from affective experiences than younger adults and whether relevant and irrelevant sources of feelings may impact older-adult decision performance more. The tasks are intended to identify factors that might hurt older adult performance and to test methods to enhance their decision making.\r\n\r\nThis research will add to the growing body of knowledge concerning how affective and deliberative ways of thinking may follow particular developmental paths.  In addition, proposals to improve decision-making abilities are based primarily on research with younger adults.  Decision making is essential to life at all ages, however, and older adults are increasingly being asked to make their own decisions.  No longer are health and financial decisions left entirely to specialists such as the family doctor.  Instead, older adults are faced with more choices and more information than in previous generations at a point in their lives when their abilities to deliberate carefully about important decisions may be declining.  Understanding the psychological processes that underlie the judgments and decisions of older adults will help us to identify areas in which they may be most vulnerable and guide efforts to help them maintain their health, financial security, and quality of life.",
