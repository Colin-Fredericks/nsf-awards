 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merits: This project at Mercy College supports (1) recruitment, screening, and the selection two cohorts of 15 talented, economically disadvantaged students, enabling them to pursue full-time study towards the completion of their bachelor's degree; (2) ensures that at least 95% of participants are retained and make satisfactory progress towards completion of their degree program; (3) provides a comprehensive series of support services that will highlight research, professional development, and employment opportunities for CIS, CS, and Math majors and further placement of students after graduation; and (4) by the end of grant Year 4 enable 25 project participants to complete CIS, CS, or Math coursework and requirements towards a bachelor's degree. Broader impacts: The CSEMS Program at Mercy College plays an important role in ensuring that underrepresented students have the opportunity to participate in a structured program of mentoring, research internship opportunities, and a comprehensive program of support services that will enable them to depend less on work and experience activities that will prepare them for post baccalaureate educational or career opportunities. Through special mentoring programs for CSEMS students, partnerships for internship placements with research-intensive universities that offer doctoral degrees in the computer sciences, as well as financial support, Mercy's CSEMS program works to increase the number of students, underrepresented in the computer science and math fields, who complete degree programs in this area and pursue graduate education in these fields.",
