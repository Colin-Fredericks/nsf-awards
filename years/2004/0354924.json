The link between \r\nthese topics is the blend of algebra and algebraic geometry, influenced by \r\ntechniques and motivation from algebraic topology.  Progress in algebraic \r\ncycles, with related results in algebraic K-theory, has been dramatic.  \r\nThe principal contributors to motivic cohomology which underlies this \r\nprogress, Bloch, Suslin, and Voevodsky, have agreed to participate.  \r\nRelated investigations include work of Lawson, Lichtenbaum, Walker, and \r\nWeibel, all of whom have agreed to participate.  Developments in modular \r\nrepresentation theory involving cohomological techniques such as support \r\nvarieties have also generated considerable excitement, and some of the \r\nleading researchers in this area (Benson, Nakano and Parshall) will also\r\nparticipate in this conference.\r\n\r\nThe occasion of this conference is the 60th birthday of  Eric Friedlander; \r\nthe venue is Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, from Thursday, \r\nSeptember 16- Sunday September 19, 2004.  Indeed, most of the lecturers \r\nwill be mathematicians who have collaborated with Friedlander on aspects \r\nof the topics mentioned above.  The conference plans to support participation \r\nby a number of young people, at both the post-doctoral and advanced graduate \r\nstudent level, so that it will serve to stimulate increased interest and \r\nparticipation in these exciting mathematical topics.
