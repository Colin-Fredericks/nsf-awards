 "awd_abstract_narration": "The genetic control of mating behavior (courtship) is very important for the survival of a species. However, little is known about the genes that regulate this behavior. The study of mating behavior of fruit flies provides a simple way to identify and study genes that control this process since the fly's courtship ritual consists of well-defined steps that are easy to observe in the laboratory. \r\n         The same regulatory pathways, which determine sexual differentiation in the animal as a whole, control sex-specific behavior.  In contrast to mammals, where hormones play an important role in this process, the brain of male fruit flies develops in a male specific manner without requiring hormones. When parts of the male brain are made female by genetic manipulation, mating behavior is severely disturbed. Although sexual differentiation of the brain is critical for proper male behavior, another tissue, which is not part of the brain, but surrounds it, is also important for courtship. It is unknown how this tissue contributes to mating behavior. The aim of this project is to study the role of this tissue in the regulation of male courtship. How does it influence the brain? It is known that this tissue secretes a number of proteins into the fly's circulatory system from where they could possibly contact the brain. One of these proteins has already been shown to play a role in courtship behavior. How does it work? Are there other secreted factors that affect courtship? How can diffusible factors influence the brain and behavior? The study of these questions will contribute to our understanding of how genes and molecules regulate complex behaviors. In addition, this exciting work will provide a rich learning experience for undergraduate students in genetic and molecular techniques\r\n",
