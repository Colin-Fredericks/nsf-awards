 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. T. Baumiller at the University of Michigan to make improvements to the invertebrate fossil collection in the Museum of Paleontology (UMMP). Funding is being used to correct a number of urgent conservation problems in the collection and to partially replace antiquated wooden cabinets with modern, archival-quality metal cabinets. The collection is used widely in research and training of future paleontologists. Included in the collection are over 6500 \"type\" and \"figured\" specimens as well as many exquisitely preserved fossils from classic field localities that are no longer accessible. These are among the most important specimens to science because they are the essential reference material that scientists depend upon when evaluating potentially new species or new occurrences. National Science Foundation support will help to ensure that this important collection is properly housed and conserved for future use. \r\n\tMany fossils contain the mineral pyrite (iron disulfide), and the oxidation of pyrite is a serious problem in many natural history collections. In the presence of water and oxygen, pyrite breaks down, forming secondary minerals that may obliterate surface detail of the fossil and produce stress fractures that lead to physical disintegration of the specimen. Caustic sulfuric acid may also be produced during the breakdown reactions, causing further damage to specimens, labels, and storage trays. Byne's \"disease\" is also a problem in the collection and occurs when corrosive volatiles, particularly organic acids emanating from the breakdown of wood and paper products, react with calcium carbonate in specimens.  These reactions cause the growth of secondary crystals that can also damage specimens severely. A large number of the finest and most important specimens in the UMMP collection contain pyrite are thus at risk. A smaller number show signs of Byne's \"disease\".  A protocol for remedial and preventive conservation using state-of-the-art methods will be implemented to salvage damaged specimens and protect the collections from future damage. The treatments are based on proven conservation techniques and will include 1) brush-cleaning, 2) de-acidification of specimens with ethanolamine thioglycollate and ammonia gas, 3) dry-cleaning with anhydrous ethanol, 4) the use of desiccants to remove reactive water, and 5) creation of protective oxygen, moisture, and corrosive-free microenvironments using barrier-film bags. Non-archival quality materials in the collections will be replaced with archival quality materials. The antiquated wooden cabinets now housing the specimens at greatest risk will be replaced with archival quality metal cabinets and all specimens will be moved to a newly renovated, larger, secure facility. The metal cabinets will provide an added measure of protection because wooden cabinets are known to release corrosive volatiles such as formic and acetic acid, which can lead to Byne's \"disease\", promote pyrite decomposition, and harm specimen labels and trays. The new cabinets will also provide much more efficient storage and with the added space in the new facility allow a much greater ease of use. \r\n\tThe broader impacts of this project include safeguarding the collection and improving access for scientists and students.  The collection is widely used in research and teaching and contains many vulnerable specimens from localities that no longer exist or are no longer accessible. Our knowledge of life's history depends on the integrity and longevity of collections such as this. The project will involve graduate student assistants and provide valuable training in critical aspects of collections-care to future paleontologists.  The UMMP invertebrate collections are also widely used in public education and exhibits, and their preservation will ensure that the general public continues to benefit from them.\r\n\r\n",
