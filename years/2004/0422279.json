 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) is developing and implementing the UMR CSEM Scholars, a program that is awarding 14 scholarships annually for 4 years and addresses the following challenges: 1) increase student enrollment and retention in Computer Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEM); 2) increase percentage of students enrolled in CSEM degree programs that originate from low-income households; 3) increase retention and graduate rate of CSEM low income students; and 4) increase post-graduation success of CSEM graduates originating from low-income households.  These goals are accomplished by providing the CSEM scholars with an environment to achieve their best academic performance, and enable them to succeed in the workforce by guiding them in leadership, professional development, and personal growth.  CSEM scholars are provided a wide variety of support structures and activities including a set of half-day seminars in each semester to strengthen their professional development alongside their academic development in the curriculum.  The project is being assessed throughout the duration to determine effectiveness of recruiting, retaining and graduating low-income students.  The results of this assessment are made available through local and national dissemination venues including publication in journals, conference presentations and web-based information.",
