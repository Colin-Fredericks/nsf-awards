Carlson DMS-0401431\r\n\r\nTitle of Project: Modular Representations of Finite Groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project is an investigation into the representation theory and \r\ncohomology of finite groups over fields of prime characteristic. The Principal\r\nInvestigator is particularly interested in the homological properties of \r\nrepresentations which underlie the basic module theory. He will continue  \r\nworking on the classification of certain specific types of modules that \r\nplay an important role in the larger category theory of modules, and also \r\nto look at the general structure of the cohomology rings. Carlson and his \r\ncollaborators have shown that many facets of the module category for group\r\nalgebras are controlled by the group cohomology.  The proposed work would build \r\non this foundation.  Professor Carlson plans to continue his development of \r\ncomputer algebra systems for experimentation with modules and homomorphisms. Of \r\nparticular interest is the development of algorithms for studying homological\r\nproperties for finite dimensional algebras. The PI intends to expand his \r\ncollection of programs for the computation of group cohomology and other \r\naspects of the module theory.  Other projects involve connections with\r\nthe representation theory of algebraic groups and the general theory\r\nof group extensions.\r\n\r\nIn basic terms the Principal Investigator will look at certain types of\r\nalgebraic systems together with the actions of operators. Such a system \r\nis called a module and it might have many dimensions in the sense of \r\ndepending on many variable. The operations may represent something like\r\nthe geometric rotation of points on a space. The project will concentrate\r\non the classification and properties of modules whose associated operators\r\ncome from a group or algebra. This means that the operators have a preset \r\ncollection of interactions with each other. A significant part of the \r\nproject is the development of computational techniques and software for \r\nanalyzing the structure and properties of modules. Groups of transformations\r\non modules and spaces are basic objects in modern mathematics and arise \r\nin many applications of the mathematics.\r\n",
