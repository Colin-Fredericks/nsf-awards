 "awd_abstract_narration": "Michigan Technological University is testing a 3-D spatial skills curriculum for its effectiveness with non-engineering students in other science and mathematics fields, and with pre-college students at the middle school and high school levels.\r\n\r\nSpatial visualization is considered to be one of seven human intelligences and is an active topic in educational research. Based on previous research, two distinct themes emerge: 1) well-developed 3-D spatial skills are critical to success in STEM fields, and 2) the 3-D spatial skills of women typically lag significantly behind their male counterparts.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the need for training for some individuals, particularly women, Michigan Tech implemented a spatial skills course in 1993. The course has had a significant impact on the retention of female engineering students over the past ten years. In 1998, the team developed multimedia software and a workbook for self-paced learning. These user-friendly, gender-neutral materials have been proven to develop the 3-D spatial skills of first-year engineering students. The current project will test the materials with other audiences, including undergraduates in STEM fields outside of engineering and pre-college students in middle and high school. Particular attention will be paid to gender differences and preferred learning styles to determine if these materials are suitable for the other audiences.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed project is two-fold: a proven tool will be tested with three other audiences, and, the research will build on findings related to the study of gender-based preferred learning styles for spatial skills development. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the project will be enhanced participation of women and all students in STEM fields by removing one of the barriers to success in learning, and improved collective understanding of issues regarding spatial skills learning.\r\n",
