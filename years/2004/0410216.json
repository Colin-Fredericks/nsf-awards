 "awd_abstract_narration": "Discipline: Interdisciplinary (99)\r\n\r\nInnovative inquiry-based teaching approaches address the national challenge facing the scientific community of how to effectively build the analytical and critical thinking skills needed for full participation in a democratic society.  As part of Philadelphia University's general education requirement, non-science majors must complete a two-course science sequence.  The first science course, Environmental Science, has successfully engaged students by adding service learning projects with over forty environmental agencies.  This project is designing and implementing an interdisciplinary inquiry-based second course in the sequence called Exploring Science.  This research-oriented course is adapting successful approaches from SENCER (DUE-0088753) and ESA21 (DUE-0231171) to build critical thinking and life-long learning skills, instill a greater appreciation of the scientific mode of inquiry, and enhance and sustain awareness of critical environmental issues. Exploring Science students collect, analyze and present vital and usable data to agencies addressing pressing environmental problems in the Philadelphia area.  Half of Philadelphia University students are first generation college students and seventy percent are women.  Exploring Science is being designed to engage these often underrepresented groups. Collaboration with regional environmental agencies provides scientific data for management and policy decisions. The Exploring Science approach is being disseminated at a regional hands-on workshop, symposia at two national meetings and publication in professional journals.",
