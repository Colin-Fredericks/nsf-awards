One goal is to develop quantitative relationships between structural properties of the protein and the stationary phase.  Chromatographic performance will be characterized in terms of linear retention, capacity, and intraparticle transport. These measures are related to the underlying physical, chemical and structural properties of the stationary phase, the protein, and the eluent. Research will focus on two modes of chromatography: ion exchange chromatography (IEC) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC).  Protein adsorption kinetics will also be determined.  In terms of the broader impacts, chromatography is widely used in downstream purification in bioprocessing.  The proposed studies can provide quantitative mechanistic models that can be used to guide separation processes.  Student training will span a spectrum from modern experimental tools such as confocal microscopy to the practice of chromatography in bioprocessing.\r\n",
