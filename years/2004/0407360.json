 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to Professor John Texter at Eastern Michigan University (EMU) is made by the Division of Chemistry, the Division of Physics and the Division of Materials Science in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and the Division of Undergraduate Education in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources to support the development of three new courses addressing aspects of nanotechnology. These courses will help shape a new Bachelor of Science curriculum in Nanotechnology in the College of Technology at EMU. \r\n\r\nTwo courses for first year students, Miniaturization in Technology (a science and technology history course) and a survey course on Ultra-Small in Science and Technology (illustrating the diversity of phenomena important on nano through micron length scales), are designed to increase interest in becoming science, engineering, and technology majors. Both of these courses will be designed to motivate interest in biology, chemistry, physics, materials science, computing science, and engineering.  A laboratory course, Laboratory Measurements on the Nanoscale, for second year students will include active hands-on projects and experiments.\r\n\r\nThe first two courses will also be used to provide material for updating introductory chemistry, physics, and biology courses, as the internal impact of these courses is evaluated by the EMU University Nanotechnology Curriculum Committee.  The courses will be presented to a diverse student body at an institution committed to the education and training of women and minorities. Evaluation and dissemination plans will lead to oral presentations at professional society meetings, journal publications, a monograph on Miniaturization in Technology topics, and web-based module sharing and feedback through established science and technology web sites.  \r\n",
