 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation/Research in Undergraduate Institution (MRI/RUI) award provides funds for the acquisition of a high power tunable infrared laser, a high power ultraviolet laser, and a pulsed laser deposition vacuum chamber assembly.  Together with the institution's existing characterization equipment, this equipment will be used for advanced laser processing of materials research and thin film deposition of polymers, ceramics, and oxides.  The lasers are used to evaporate target materials inside the vacuum chamber, which are then deposited upon substrates as thin films.  The vacuum chamber has a variety of features and capabilities that include rotation of the target and a multi-target carousel that will enable the deposition of composite and/or multi-layer films.  Thin films may be deposited in either an inert or reactive background gas and the substrate may be either heated or cooled.  In addition an optical train is included that allows the laser beam to be rastered across the target.  Including the lasers, the entire system is then computer controlled and may be configured for multiple user requirements.  The instruments will be used for both research and education with particular emphasis on undergraduate students from physics, chemistry and biology.\r\n\r\nThe research that is supported by these instruments will lead to a deeper understanding of the laser-material interaction that allows the deposition of thin films.  It will provide unique research opportunities for students from across the science departments, thus fostering multidisciplinary research initiatives.  The instruments will be of benefit to ongoing research programs and will provide a common reference point for these programs.  The instruments will also support research that directly overlaps with existing curricula and reinforces classroom and laboratory learning.  Finally, thin films deposited using these instruments will have importance to diverse application areas such as microelectronics and chemical and biological sensing.\r\n",
