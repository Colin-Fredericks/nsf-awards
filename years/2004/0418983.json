 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth's climate during the late Paleozoic (ca. 300 Ma) was profoundly affected by both large-scale\r\ncontinental glaciation and monsoonal circulation. Accordingly, key elements of its climate exhibit\r\nparallels to Earth's modern climate, which has intrigued both those who model climate, and those who\r\nreconstruct climate using proxy data. Validation and further sophistication of climate models of this\r\ninterval are hampered, however, by low-resolution geologic datasets. That is, although the broad strokes\r\nof Pangea's climate system are well established, many aspects remain unconstrained.\r\nPreliminary geochronologic and sedimentologic data collected by the PIs from a lower Permian\r\nloessite-paleosol couplet in the study region document a profound shift in equatorial wind direction and\r\nstrength; the PIs hypothesize that this shift signals a geologically abrupt change in the intensity of\r\nmonsoonal circulation of western Pangea between glacials, and interglacials. The objective of the\r\nproposed study, therefore, is to examine and characterize in detail the character, variability, and\r\nchronology of such high-frequency shifts in atmospheric circulation in western equatorial Pangea, just\r\nbefore and after onset of monsoonal conditions. To achieve this, the PIs and students will study loessite\r\n(eolian silt) and intercalated paleosols that record alternating glacial-interglacial states. The PIs have\r\ntargeted for study loessite-paleosol couplets that represent wide geographic coverage in western\r\nequatorial Pangea (western U.S.), and that date from (1) middle-late Pennsylvanian (zonal), and (2) early\r\nPermian (monsoonal) times. Each study couplet will be subjected to several previously-tested techniques\r\nincluding detrital-zircon based provenance analysis, magnetic susceptibility, whole-rock geochemistry,\r\nand grain-size analysis as proxies for various climatic parameters including wind direction, strength, and\r\nseasonality, and relative aridity. High-precision, radio-isotopic (U-Pb) dating of the youngest (volcanic)\r\ndetrital zircons and some experimental dating of pedogenic carbonate will be used to improve absolute\r\nage constraints on the target couplets, and constrain durations of these glacial-interglacial shifts.\r\nIntellectual Merit of Proposed Activity-- Project results will enable examination of late Paleozoic\r\nicehouse variations in atmospheric circulation at an unprecedented detail, and in particular, high-resolution\r\n(glacial-interglacial) shifts in equatorial circulation during both zonal and monsoonal states of\r\nthe Pangean interval. Results will also provide improved age constraints on target strata, and durations of\r\nclimatic fluctuations, and will enable further testing of the paleosol-carbonate dating technique.\r\nBroader Impacts Resulting from Proposed Activity \"Project results will provide better constraints for\r\nclimate models of the late Paleozoic and for natural variation in climatic conditions of interglacials over\r\ngeologically long periods of time. Accordingly, results should further our understanding of Earth's\r\nclimate system in general, ultimately contributing to improved climate predictions in our modern\r\ninterglacial world. The PIs will fund and train at least two graduate students directly from this proposed\r\nresearch, and have a strong commitment to, and history of, involving undergraduate geoscience majors in\r\ntheir research, which they will continue in the proposed project. OU's formal agreement with Fort Valley\r\nState University (a Historically Black University), in which upperclassmen complete their geology\r\ndegrees at OU, offers an excellent opportunity to involve minority students in this undergraduate research.\r\nMJS has also used NSF funds to support science-education majors in undergraduate research projects, and\r\nwill actively recruit at least one such student to work on aspects of the proposed project. The project\r\nwill enhance teaching and training at all levels (undergraduate through professional). MJS teaches an\r\nEarth System Science course for education majors, and GSS teaches advanced courses in Earth's Past\r\nClimate and Depositional Systems; both PIs regularly utilizes case examples from their own research to\r\nillustrate climate concepts. Furthermore, the project will enable significant cross-disciplinary training, and\r\ninvolves a mixed-gender research team of sedimentologists and geochronologists. Finally, the PIs and\r\nstudents will continue to disseminate results in high-profile journals and at national meetings.",
