 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CSEMS scholarship program at the Miami University in Oxford, Ohio is a partnership between the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, the School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the Department of Computer Science and Systems Analysis. The project provides some 29 scholarships for first-year students, transfer students and graduate students. The project increases student graduation rates while improving academic performance. It enhances the academic environment for CSEMS scholars as they complete an undergraduate or graduate degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or Mathematics.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The first year students will live in the residence halls that are part of Miami's \"Living and Learning Communities\". The living and learning communities support students as they begin their scholarly journey. The mission of these communities is to create and extend learning opportunities outside the classroom that heighten student intellectual and personal growth, and they integrate curricular with co-curricular experiences that complement and extend classroom learning. These environments foster faculty and resident interactions that build a strong sense of community for the students. The theme for the CSEMS students will be \"Technology: Cross Disciplinary Usage\". \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The project includes efforts to recruit and retain minorities from underrepresented groups by leveraging Ohio's Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program. Students are connected to the career/advising/mentoring services of the university and the support structures designed specifically for CSEMS scholars.\r\n",
