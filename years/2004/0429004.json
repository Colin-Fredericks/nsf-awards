 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pathogens cause many diseases of marine plants and animals, including those of molluscan shellfish (e.g., clams, oysters, scallops). Some of these diseases have resulted in catastrophic declines in shellfish populations leading to the erosion of ecological function and damage to fishery-based economies. Despite these impacts, little is known about the ecology of many marine pathogens, including the natural factors that facilitate their spread. Marine aggregates (also known as marine snow or flocs) are ubiquitous in the marine environment and range in size from microscopic to a few inches. Aggregates form by natural processes, are enriched with many types of microorganisms and tend to sink rapidly to the bottom. Consequently, bottom-dwelling shellfish are exposed to a steady supply of marine aggregates and the various microorganisms contained within. In this research, marine scientists from three institutions will combine field sampling, molecular biology, and transmission experiments to construct a model of the ecological role of aggregates in harboring and spreading shellfish pathogens.  \r\n\r\nMolluscan shellfish are both ecologically and economically important, and play key roles in ecosystem processes. This research will shed light on how pathogens encounter and invade shellfish by describing and modeling a potentially important and largely unknown path by which water-born pathogens could be transmitted. This work will lead to a better understanding of how marine diseases spread, and the potential impacts on important populations. The collaborative effort will unite the expertise of specialists in shellfish physiology and pathology, and ecological modeling to carry-out novel research, public outreach and multidisciplinary training of students in the identification and ecology of marine infectious diseases.\r\n",
