 "awd_abstract_narration": "Six undergraduate students will be provided with an enjoyable and productive research experience in the area of experimental field biology over a ten-week period in May through July. Research activities will be centered at Sam Houston State University's 250-acre Center for Biological Field Studies.  Students will live in modern apartment-style dormitories on campus.  Students will gain confidence in their abilities as scientists through planning, conducting and being responsible for their own research project. There will be much opportunity to interact with faculty, graduate students and other REU students through weekly seminars, field trips and social gatherings. Our goal is to foster an interest and enthusiasm for pursuing graduate studies in biology and ultimately careers in research. The program is particularly oriented toward recruiting women and students from minorities traditionally underrepresented in science as well as students from institutions without research opportunities.\r\n\tWeekly seminars will include information on how to conduct research and discussions of important issues in science. Students will work closely with faculty mentors that specialize in field biology and will have their choice among a variety of research projects in ecology, taxonomy, animal behavior, and environmental microbiology.  Our mentors work on a diversity of organisms including plants, fungi, protozoans and animals.  Students will gain experience from their specific projects and will be encouraged to learn from, and participate in, the projects of other students. Students will present their research in oral, poster and manuscript forms.  This presentation experience will provide students with the encouragement and confidence to present their research findings at a regional or national conference and to publish research findings with their mentors.  For more information contact Dr. Diane Neudorf at bio_dln@shsu.edu (Tel: 936- 294-1548) or visit http://www.shsu.edu/REU.html.\r\n",
