They will be undertaking a computational study of chemical reactions and material modification during polyatomic-ion and cluster-surface deposition.  They will look at the novel size-specific reactions that occur in gas solvent assisted chemistry when organic molecules and molecular clusters are deposited on metal clusters.  The studies aim to model film deposition and surface modification issues relevant to ongoing experimental studies.\r\n\r\nThis project brings together the efforts of two laboratories that have complementary expertise and research capabilities.  The US researchers are the theoreticians and the Japanese are the experimentalists.  The project has the potential to provide new understanding that will be important for industrial materials processing. Through the exchange of ideas and technology, this project will broaden our base of basic knowledge and promote international understanding and cooperation.  The project includes the participation of a graduate student and an undergraduate student. Results of the research will be disseminated at scientific meetings and in scientific journals.  \r\n",
