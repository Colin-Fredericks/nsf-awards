Nitrate (NO3 - ) retention, and denitrification in particular, is known to be dependent upon\r\na variety of factors: geochemical conditions (chiefly RedOx potential), substrate (largely availability\r\nof NO3 - and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)), and transport of nitrate and DOC to favorable\r\nlocations for denitrification. We will examine the controls of nitrate retention in the hyporheic zones\r\nof streams in Oregon and Wyoming: 4 forested stream reaches, 4 agricultural streams, and 4 urban\r\nstreams. Each reach will be the subject of 15 NO3 - injections in partnership with the Lotic Interbiome\r\nNitrogen eXperiment II (LINX II) project which is using nitrogen-15 ( 15 N) techniques to study\r\nuptake and retention. Collaborating with LINX II allows synergistic and cost-effective examination\r\nof stream and hyporheic nitrogen cycling. The objectives of our research are to examine the factors\r\ncontrolling nitrate retention and denitrification in hyporheic zones of small streams and to quantify\r\nthe fraction of nitrate retention in these streams due to hyporheic exchange. We will test the\r\nfollowing hypotheses: (1) hyporheic denitrification in headwater, forested streams will be low\r\nbecause of substrate and rate limitations, yet biotic assimilation will be high, relative to agricultural\r\nand urban streams, because of inorganic N-limitation; (2) hyporheic denitrification will be greatest\r\nin mid-network locations where surrounding land use is predominantly agricultural, however, total\r\nloss of NO3 - will be transport-limited and biotic assimilation will be reduced because nitrogen is less\r\nlimiting; and (3) potential rate of denitrification in the hyporheic zone will be high in the urban\r\nstream reaches, but total nitrate retention in the hyporheic zone will be low because both\r\ndenitrification and biotic assimilation will be severely transport-limited.\r\nElevation surveys of the longitudinal profiles of the stream reaches will be used to quantify channel\r\nmorphology and provide a base for groundwater flow and reactive transport simulations. We have\r\nsuccessfully used this technique to model groundwater flow and calculate hyporheic residence time\r\ndistributions [e.g., Kasahara and Wondzell, 2003; Wondzell et al., 2003]. We will use tracer tests\r\nbased on new understanding of their use for measuring residence time distributions in the hyporheic\r\nzone [Gooseff et al., 2003; Haggerty et al., 2000; Haggerty et al., 2002].\r\nWe will couple our work to the LINX II NSF project by installing a sampling well and\r\npiezometer network in the hyporheic zone of 12 LINX II experimental reaches in Oregon and\r\nWyoming. The sampling wells will provide access to hyporheic water, from which we will obtain\r\nsamples for measurement of 15 NO3 - , 15 N2(g), and 15 N2O(g) as well as DO, DOC and other physical and\r\ngeochemical parameters, which will be used to quantify biotic assimilation, denitrification, and\r\ngroundwater flow in the hyporheic zone. We will have access to LINX II stream data on these and\r\nother (e.g., 15 NH4 + ) N-species. The work will build upon, and enhance the current LINX II project.\r\nThe LINX II project will benefit from quantification of nitrogen cycling in the hyporheic zone of 12\r\nof its sites and will gain a method to refine models of nitrogen dynamics.\r\nThree of the experimental reaches are on OSU campus, which allows us to use Oak Creek as a hands-\r\non, active-learning laboratory in 3 courses with a combined annual enrollment of more than 300\r\nstudents. Through these courses, undergraduate and graduate research projects, and the participation\r\nof undergraduates in our field work, a large number of students will gain field experience in\r\nhydrology at experience-appropriate levels. The USU research team will continue to interact with\r\nmiddle school and high school students through the Teton Science School, demonstrating field\r\nactivities and facilitating hands-on field experience for these students. Together, the OSU and USU\r\nresearch teams will develop a web site with our data and project-related science activities and\r\ndissemination of results for K-12 students and teachers, and will promote learning about surface\r\nwater hydrology and water quality in local schools through the NSF-sponsored GLOBE program.",
