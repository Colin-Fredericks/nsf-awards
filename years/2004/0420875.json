In addition to marine and earth science applications, it is expected that the instrumentation will be used for research and teaching by faculty in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Department of Anthropology, as well as other Queens College departments.  The broader impacts of the acquisition include the enhancement of interdisciplinary education and research, bringing state-of-the-art research facilities and hands-on education to undergraduate and graduate students typically underrepresented in the sciences.  This proposal is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.\r\n",
