 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project aims to study the approximability measures and the design of heuristics for NP-hard optimiza-\r\ntion problems. This endeavor will result in the development of techniques that enable a deeper understanding\r\nof the principles that underlie the design of approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems. An approxima-\r\ntion algorithm is a polynomial time algorithm that produces solutions provably \\close\" to optimal.\r\nMany of the problems we study are graph theoretic. Graphs are powerful tools that can be employed to\r\nmodel objects, as well as the relationships between them. Indeed, many distinct optimization problems can be\r\ncast in graph theoretic terms. Specifically, graph theory provides an excellent way to model problems related\r\nto areas such as transportation, network design/routing, facility location, and cluster analysis. This powerful\r\nframework allows us to both develop and illustrate the power of different algorithmic tools. In addition to\r\ngraph problems, we also study some fundamental scheduling, data management and broadcasting problems.\r\nIntellectual Merit: An increased understanding of techniques to develop and apply approximation algo-\r\nrithms will have a significant impact on both research and practice. As we are well aware, NP complete\r\nproblems are abundant in many scientific and engineering disciplines, any technique that effectively copes\r\nwith this diffculty will have a significant impact on the design of heuristics.\r\nBroader Impact: The broader scientific goals are to both further the field of algorithms in terms of our\r\nunderstanding of what problems can be solved efficiently and what problems cannot. In addition, we explore\r\napplications of these algorithms in other areas such as networking, GRID computing, parallel computing etc.\r\nThe project will train two full time PhD students in conducting research both in Universities and through\r\ninternships during the summer at National Labs and Industrial Research Centers.",
