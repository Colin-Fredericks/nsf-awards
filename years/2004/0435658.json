 "awd_abstract_narration": "Creating Laboratory Access for Science Students (CLASS) is an initiative to promote excellence in the\r\nscience education for students with physical and learning disabilities. Based at Wright State University\r\n(WSU) CLASS has received two major NSF grants in excess of $1M from DUE (CCLI) spanning about 7\r\nyears. CLASS believes that systemic reform of inclusive science education must focus on training\r\neducators at all levels. The central philosophy is that given appropriate accommodation, most people with\r\nphysical and learning disabilities can participate fully in the scientific endeavor. The focus of past funding has been to develop inclusive resources for science educators and to offer intensive summer workshops that promote attitudes and strategies for inclusive, inquiry based science education. Numerous science educators have come to WSU for the workshops. Many have returned to their institutions to effect significant change. Disseminable products have included a widely distributed SourceBook on CD-ROM and training videos that have been used at professional meetings. A small grant program has provided funds to classroom educators for adaptive equipment and programs. These initiatives have also guided curriculum design in undergraduate science and science education courses at WSU, contributing substantially to the success of our science majors who have physical disabilities. This RDE-DEI will expand current efforts to modify curricula. This process will include making modification recommendations to peer-reviewed lesson plans from the Ohio Resource Center (ORC) for the full inclusion of students with disabilities. These recommendations will be made by teams of science, math and special education majors at Wright State University. Finalized recommendations will be uploaded to the ORC website and will then be available for educators across the nation. Also, for educators calling into the ORC with specific questions regarding education for student with disabilities, resources will be made available.",
