 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\n\tThis half-hour video documentary highlights Earthscope's goals and mission and provides a timely education and outreach resource as Earthscope gets off the ground.  Containing film footage of current and past experiments, geologic landforms, and action scenes of earthquakes and volcanoes, plus plentiful 3D animations, the video (working title: Earth Live!) is a vehicle for introducing Earthscope to the public through nationwide broadcasts on educational television, and through dissemination of a DVD and video to the educational community for use as a classroom learning resource and Earthscope recruitment tool.\r\n\r\n\tThe video's storyline places Earthscope in the broad context of the historic and future advancement of knowledge of Earth processes operating on the North American continent.  Watching the video on television and in the classroom, viewers learn about the latest Earth science theories and research on earthquakes, volcanoes, and continental growth, and how earth science knowledge contributes to geohazard reduction and wiser land and resource use.  The video's portrayal of women and scientists from underrepresented groups in important research roles helps Earthscope E&O representatives recruit a diverse group of participants into the Earthscope research effort.\r\n\r\n\tThis documentary is being produced by Earth Images Foundation, collaborating with Earthscope scientists and education and outreach representatives, a PBS television production director, and with input from a formative evaluation process that informs concept development and production.  \r\n\r\n",
