The purpose of this proposal is to support travel and lodging expenses for young investigators and graduate students to attend the Auxin 2004 Conference in Crete on May 22-28, 2004.  The meeting will focus on the latest advances in the molecular genetic and developmental aspects of auxin biology.  Discussions will involve a range of model organisms, as well as the application of the latest genomics technologies to auxin research.  There will be 100-200 scientists present, and the speakers will include leaders in the field, as well as new investigators.  A large percentage of the speakers will be females.  Student participation will be stressed.  \r\n\r\nAuxin 2004 is the second international meeting held exclusively on auxin biology during the past four years.  Much cutting-edge plant science is taking place in this area of research, and the ambience and small size of the meeting should encourage interactions that will promote further excellence. \r\n",
