 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project focuses on development and applications of nonlinear optical techniques to study polymers and liquid crystals. Sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy will be developed as a powerful tool to characterize polymer surfaces and interfaces. It will yield unique information on surface structures of various polymers in different environments at the molecular level. Since polymer surfaces play an important role in many applications, our results will have lasting impact on polymer science and technology. The same spectroscopic technique can be applied to many other interfaces and will have broad influences on many surface-related disciplines of physical and biological sciences. Applying this technique to liquid crystal interfaces will provide a better understanding and control of the effects of surfaces on liquid crystal devices. Nonlinear optical spectroscopic techniques are also being developed as sensitive tools to probe molecular chirality and guest/host interactions in organic thin films, both being of great importance in chemistry and bioscience. \r\n%%%\r\nThis research project focuses on nonlinear optical studies of polymers and liquid crystals. A powerful laser spectroscopic technique is being developed as a unique tool to characterize structures of polymer surfaces and interfaces at the molecular level. Such characterization makes control of polymer surface properties by material design possible. Our results will therefore have very strong impact on polymer science and technology since polymer surfaces play an important role in many applications. More generally, surfaces and interfaces are of great importance in almost all areas of science and technology, and this technique is applicable to most of them.  Study of liquid crystal interfaces, for example, enables one to learn how specially designed surfaces of a liquid crystal display device can be used to control the device characteristics.  Other laser techniques are being developed as sensitive tools to probe molecular chirality, an important characteristic property of bio-molecules, and to study how a small amount of foreign molecules can control the behavior of a large number of host molecules. Students find unique opportunities in this laboratory to learn ideas and skills for high-quality research in interdisciplinary areas and to obtain know-how on development of novel laser spectroscopic techniques. This project is attracts top students, especially those in under-represented groups. These students receive rigorous training on cutting-edge laser spectroscopic techniques and research skills in a broad interdisciplinary area. The students are well prepared for future careers in many possible disciplines.\r\n***\r\n",
