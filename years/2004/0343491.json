 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will organize a Gordon Research Conference on Protein Folding Dynamics to be held on January 11-16, 2004, at the Four Points Sheraton, Harbortown, Ventura, California. A quantitative description of Biology is rapidly emerging as a major new frontier for science in the 21st century. This field involves the cross-fertilization of ideas and methods from biology and biochemistry on the one hand and the physics of complex systems on the other. Protein Folding represents the premier case where this approach is becoming successful and is becoming an example for other fields in biology. The theoretical and experimental collaboration needed for the success of this field has been established, and this Gordon Conference on Protein Folding Dynamics is becoming the main forum for discussion of these interactions. This second Gordon conference will provide an excellent forum for an exchange of ideas from scientists with different backgrounds.\r\n\r\nThis conference is supported by the Molecular Biophysics Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
