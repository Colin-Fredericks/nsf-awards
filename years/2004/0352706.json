 "awd_abstract_narration": "0352706\r\nDravid\r\nDescription: This award supports the US-India cooperative research entitled Electronic Detection of Biomolecular Interactions.  Professors Vinayak Dravid and Gajendra Shekhawat of Northwestern University will collaborate with senior scientists C. R. Suri and Girish Varshney of the Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), Chandigarh on advanced sensor systems able to detect biochemical nerve agents.  The goal is to address critical issues associated with smart sensor systems, with an integrated approach based on novel functionalized multiplexed micro-cantilever arrays that are fully integrated with an on-chip microelectronics platform.  They expect to complete a turnkey system consisting of fully integrated detection technologies that are capable of monitoring hazardous environments and producing automated decision output in the face of bio-chemical threats.  \r\n\r\nScope:  The US and Indian groups have diverse yet complementary expertise in materials science, biology and engineering and have the potential to advance bio-chemical sensor technology to new heights.  IMTECH is one of the advanced institutes belonging to the Government of India's Council of Scientific and Industrial Research institutions.  In addition to the significant educational benefits for students and researchers in both countries, the investigators will do public outreach with display modules of Integrated Nanosensors at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry.  This research is also supported by India's Department of Science & Technology (DST) under the NSF/DST joint program.   \r\n\r\n\r\n",
