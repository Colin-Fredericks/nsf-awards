 "awd_abstract_narration": "Low-dimensional conducting materials continue to provide one of the richest arenas for research in condensed matter physics. Of these materials, the MX(2) and MX(3) compounds, where M=Nb, Ta . . . and X=S, Se . . ., provide unique opportunities for fundamental studies of low-d physics in general and of charge-density waves and flux-line-lattices in particular.  This individual investigator award will support a diverse program of experiments on MX(2) and MX(3) compounds that will build on vigorous efforts in crystal growth and characterization and in nanostructure fabrication. Experiments will study local pinning and single particle-collective mode interactions in CDW conductors at low temperatures; dynamics of single phase-coherent CDW domains, velocity-dependent spatio-temporal correlations in CDW dynamics; phase slip in fully gapped CDW materials; field-effect charge modulation in MX(2) and MX(3) dots using ferroelectric gates; and flux-line lattice dynamics in microfabricated NbSe(2) single crystals.  This program of research and graduate training will be complemented by the PI's longstanding and vigorous efforts in undergraduate education and outreach.\r\n\r\nNovel electronic materials including high-temperature superconductors, conducting polymers, carbon nanotubes, and charge-density-wave conductors illuminate the fundamental physical processes that underlie how solid state electronic devices work and provide opportunities for creating the electronics of tomorrow.   This individual individual investigator project includes a wide range of experiments to probe the fundamental physics of charge-density wave conductors and their potential for applications. It will provide excellent training to graduate and undergraduate students in the techniques of modern materials science, solid-state physics, and nanotechnology. This project will be complemented by vigorous efforts in undergraduate education and outreach, including development of a web-based tutorial/evaluation system in elementary scientific mathematics and development of a new program to increase the number of high school physics teachers trained at Cornell and to improve the quality of their training.\r\n",
