 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cooperation and dominance are central to the study of animal\r\nsocial relations, a remarkable feature of which is the emergence\r\nand persistence of linear dominance hierarchies or \"pecking\r\norders.\"  For well over half a century, the conventional\r\ntheoretical approach to cooperation and dominance has been to\r\nstudy them separately.  But this approach ultimately yields\r\ndiminishing returns, because each phenomenon incorporates crucial\r\naspects of the other.  On the one hand, a dominance hierarchy is a\r\ncooperative structure: well organized groups, in which each\r\nindividual knows and is fairly resigned to its particular social\r\nstatus, are more productive than similar groups in a constant\r\nstate of organizational turmoil.  On the other hand, there are\r\nindividual benefits to holding high rank within a dominance\r\nhierarchy, and animals can help themselves obtain those benefits\r\nby forming coalitions with others.  The investigator studies these\r\nconnections between cooperation and dominance by developing a\r\nsuite of analytical and computational models to predict the\r\neffects of coalition formation on the emergence and stability of\r\ndominance hierarchies versus more egalitarian social structures,\r\nand to identify conditions that favor each possible outcome.  The\r\nmodels are \"games,\" i.e., mathematical models of strategic\r\ninteraction.\r\n\r\n     There is no formal theory to predict the effects of\r\ncoalitions and domoinance hierarchies on each other, yet such\r\ntheory is urgently needed to guide and interpret field studies in\r\nthe biological and social sciences.   The development of such a\r\nformal theory also leads to advances in game-theoretic techniques. \r\nMoreover, because there are good reasons to suppose that\r\nmechanisms for social stability are broadly similar across\r\ndifferent kinds of groups, the project has likely implications for\r\nconflict resolution among humans.  In particular, the results of\r\nthe project should help to resolve an ongoing controversy in\r\nanthropology between those who argue that egalitarian societies\r\nare deliberately shaped by their members, with the political rank\r\nand file creating a \"reverse dominance hierarchy,\" and those who\r\nstress that levelling mechanisms operate independently of people's\r\nintentions.  Finally, a central goal is to develop an online game\r\ntheory workshop for students in the life and social sciences.  All\r\nmaterials developed during the project -- in particular, numerous\r\ngame-theoretic computer programs -- are made freely available\r\nthrough this web site.  It therefore serves as a permanent legacy,\r\nwith the potential to strengthen the modelling skills of every\r\nstudent of game theory.\r\n",
