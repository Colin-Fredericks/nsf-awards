 "awd_abstract_narration": "Members of the genus Phytophthora cause enormous damage to a wide variety of plants, such as the important agricultural crop soybean, and are very difficult to control due to their unique biology. The genome sequence of two species (P. sojae and P. ramorum) will soon be available and an important challenge is assigning function to the genes identified.  As with many non-model organisms, there are very few tools or resources for disrupting specific genes in Phytophthora and there is a need for large-scale strategies to complete functional genomic analyses. The overall objective of this CAREER project is to develop a reverse-genetics tool for Phytophthora to isolate gene-specific mutants.  Key aspects of the underlying technology for this project are adapted from the TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes) tool currently in place for the Arabidopsis community. This tool will have a broad impact on the Phytophthora research community by generating a wide array of functionally impaired mutants.  Specifically, mutants lacking functional copies of genes important for spore production, spore germination, spore motility, chemotaxis, drug resistance, signal transduction, virulence, and avirulence will be isolated.  Phytophthora research groups in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and Europe will participate in this project and coordination among Phytophthora researchers worldwide will be facilitated.  All of the mutants will be made freely available to interested scientists and information pertaining to the mutants will be posted on a web-accessible database.  Integrated with the above research is a reverse genetics educational program using P. sojae as a model. The core biological concept is mutation.  In particular, the impact of small genetic lesions on the biology of diverse organisms will be presented and the implications discussed.  Training workshop will be offered for local students, and recruitment efforts will include underrepresented groups and students from the local HBCU Knoxville College. \r\n",
