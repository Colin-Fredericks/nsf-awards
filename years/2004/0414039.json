 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator constructs mathematical models for bacterial\r\npropulsion and pattern formation.  Attention is restricted mostly\r\nto two classes of bacteria: myxobacteria and mollicutes.  This work\r\nis performed in collaboration or correspondence with experimental\r\nlaboratories engaged in studies of these organisms.  The models are\r\nprimarily directed towards understanding and explaining their\r\nexperimental observations.  The specific goals of this project are to\r\nmodel (i) the gliding mechanisms of Myxobacteria and Mollicutes, (ii)\r\nthe swimming mechanisms of E. coli and Synechococcus, and (iii)\r\naggregation and fruiting body formation in Myxobacteria.\r\n\r\n     The investigator develops mathematical and computational models\r\nof different mechanisms by which bacteria move.  Bacteria use\r\nmany different mechanisms to move about on surfaces and through\r\nfluids.  The term \"gliding\" is used to describe the motion of\r\nbacteria on surfaces when there is no visible means of\r\npropulsion.  The investigator studies the molecular and cellular\r\nmechanisms that underlie this mysterious form of locomotion. \r\nMany bacteria swim, driven by rotating \"propellors\" called\r\nflagella.  However, the motor mechanism that turns this propellor\r\nhas not been worked out, and is a focus of this project.  The\r\nphotosynthetic bacterium, Synechococcus, lives in the oceans, and\r\nconstitutes the most abundant organism on the planet.  How it\r\nswims is a longstanding mystery, for it has no visible propulsive\r\norganelle on its surface.  The investigator and his colleagues\r\nsuggest and model a mechanism for how this bacterium swims.  The\r\nbroader impact of these studies grows from the insights they\r\nprovide into the propulsion, development, and mechanochemistry of\r\nbacteria, many of which are important pathogens of great medical\r\ninterest.\r\n",
