 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this renewal proposal the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program continues its support for the work of Professor Bart Kahr of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA.  The research will build on the PI's construction of the first successful visible light, circular extinction imaging microscope  (CEIM) during the previously funded grant period.  This instrument will be rebuilt and refined with components of high optical quality for the detection of weak dichroism and scattering.  With this instrument, images of mixed crystals will be made via two mechanisms, intrinsic circular dichroism and a new effect, discovered by the PI, called optical rotatory scattering.  Using this technique, the PI will collect data to determine the mechanisms of crystal growth. \r\n\r\nThe new CIEM instrument will be applicable to a vast array of problems in cell biology and materials science.  The interactions of adsorbates with chiral crystal surfaces will be investigated by collecting direct spectroscopic evidence of enantioselectivity at interfaces using the CIEM.  The PI's experience, gained in studies of single crystals, will be extended to the areas of pathology and cell biology using dyed polycrystalline materials.  In addition, the research will provide valuable training for students in the area of crystal fabrication, a skill that has been lacking in the workplace.\r\n",
