 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Sciences (61) This project is focused on developing methods to improve the education of students in rapidly changing areas of the biosciences.  The objective is to improve the problem solving skills of bioscience majors through the use of inquiry-based science education.  Wireless laptop technology and the integration of computational biology methods, including bioinformatics, are being integrated into courses for biology majors.  These biology courses combine lecture/discussion and laboratory in the same classroom, an organization that has many pedagogical advantages.  In this environment, community college bioscience majors in three courses (Principles of Biology I & II and Genetics) are using investigative laboratory simulations, including Bioquest, Microbes Count, Virtual Fly Lab, etc., to study topics that cannot be easily addressed in the traditional laboratory setting.  Student groups, or \"collaboratories,\" can continue group work on problems outside of class time because the software is also on the campus network.  The project helps students appreciate the multidisciplinary nature of current approaches to research, as well as the important role of the computer as a research tool.",
