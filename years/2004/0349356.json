 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award funds a research and education program in dynamical paleoclimatology - the study of paleoclimatic observations within the context of modern physical climatology. The basic idea supporting the research is that the systematic assimilation of paleo-proxy observations into a model's system permits concise testing of competing hypotheses regarding the root causes of paleoclimate variations. The strategy also provides unique opportunities to investigate the fundamental biogeophysical controls on climate proxy formation and improve the precision and accuracy of proxy-based reconstructions of climate. \r\n\r\nThe specific goals of the research include: 1) Development of new proxy rainfall data from replicated, high-resolution stable isotope measurements made on tropical trees in northwest coastal Peru to improve the precision and accuracy of tropical climate field reconstructions by alleviating spatial and temporal gaps in coverage in the terrestrial tropics; 2) Interpretation of new paleoclimate data using a process (i.e., forward) model of stable isotopic composition of wood. It is proposed that the inter-comparison of forward and inverse (i.e., statistical) models will improve the quality of climate reconstructions; 3) Paleoclimatic model-data syntheses using multi-proxy data networks and simple models of large-scale climate dynamics; 4) Development, implementation, and assessment of a graduate-level survey course in paleoclimatological techniques; and 5) Development, implementation, and assessment of an introductory course in weather and climate, that is sensitive to the worldview of the Tohono O'odham Nation. This specific class will be taught at the Tohono O'odham Community College (TOCC) and will help enhance the science curriculum at TOCC, create a mentored pathway for O'odham students to pursue four-year degrees and research opportunities at the University of Arizona (and beyond), and help enhance diversity in the field of paleoclimate research and education.",
