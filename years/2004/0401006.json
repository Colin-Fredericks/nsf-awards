 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main aspect of the project is to consider decomposing families of \r\nfinite and infinite groups as the product of cyclic, Abelian or solvable \r\nsubgroups. The historical background comes from Ito's  theorem, Lazard's \r\nwork on analytic pro-p groups and the connection between bounded \r\ngeneration and the congruence subgroup property for arithmetic groups \r\nestablished by Lubotzky, Platonov and Rapinchuk. While the PI considers \r\nproblems motivated by these major results, he also investigates cyclic, \r\nAbelian and solvable decompositions in a broader context: for finite \r\nsimple groups, infinite permutation groups, geometric groups and groups \r\nacting on trees. Besides rather surprising constructions (e.g., the \r\ninfinite symmetric group is the product of finitely many Abelian \r\nsubgroups), the existence of such a decomposition leads to strong \r\nasymptotic restrictions (e.g. on subgroup growth). On the other hand, \r\ntrying to show that a certain decomposition does not exist forces one to \r\nlook at the subgroup structure from a new point of view which then can be \r\nanalyzed further. An example for this is Hausdorff dimension of groups \r\nacting on rooted trees. \r\n\r\nThe set of symmetries of any object or structure forms a group. Thus group \r\ntheory naturally comes into the picture whenever one needs to analyze \r\nsymmetries (e.g. in quantum physics and chemistry or inside mathematics in \r\ngeometry, number theory, coding theory and topology). The main goal of the \r\nproposed project is to find certain 'coordinate systems' in families of \r\ngroups and so generate these groups in a transparent way using simple \r\nstructures or to show that such nice systems do not exist. An elementary \r\nexample is the fact that every plane isometry can be obtained as the \r\ncomposition of at most three reflections but not as the composition of \r\ntwo. There are manifold connections between the existence of such \r\n'coordinate systems' and various other interesting group properties. Other \r\nthan deep and useful results, the project also has elementary aspects \r\nwhich can be presented on an undergraduate level and thus serve \r\neducational purposes.\r\n",
