 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract for the project:\r\n\r\nDistributed source coding (DSC) refers to the compression of the outputs\r\nof two or more physically separated sources that do not communicate with\r\neach other. Driven by a host of emerging applications (e.g., distributed\r\nsensor networks and wireless video), DSC has assumed renewed interest in\r\nrecent years. Although the theoretical result given by the Slepian-Wolf\r\ntheorem has been known for more than 30 years, practical approaches to\r\nDSC did not appear until 1999.\r\n\r\nAiming to advance the field, this research covers the theory, algorithms,\r\nand applications of DSC, with focus on the hard problem of practical code\r\ndesign. The basic element of a distributed source code is the binning\r\nscheme. For Wyner-Ziv code design, the PI proposes a paradigm based on\r\nSlepian-Wolf coded quantization (SWCQ). Preliminary analytical results\r\nshow that the performance limits of SWCQ mirror those in classic source\r\ncoding. Initial code design based on TCQ and LDPC codes gives results that\r\nare significantly better than any previously reported. Inspired by these\r\nresults, the PI proposes to study successive refinement for the Wyner-Ziv\r\nproblem and apply SWCQ to layered video coding.\r\n\r\nThis research will also tackle the more general problem of multiterminal\r\nsource coding under the same powerful paradigm of SWCQ. While asymmetric\r\nSlepian-Wolf coding is used in SWCQ for Wyner-Ziv coding, for\r\nmultiterminal source coding with SWCQ, the PI will explore symmetric\r\nSlepian-Wolf coding after quantization of each source. Both direct\r\nmultiterminal source coding and indirect multiterminal source coding \r\n(e.g., the CEO problem that arises in distributed sensor networks) will \r\nbe treated.\r\n\r\nThe theme of the research is to view lossy DSC as a source-channel coding\r\nproblem and perform algebraic binning via the combination of quantization\r\nand Slepian-Wolf coding based on channel codes. The main novelty lies in\r\nusing a single SWCQ framework as the embodiment of algebraic binning to\r\nsolve different code design problems and address potential applications.\r\n\r\n",
