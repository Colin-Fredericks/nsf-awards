The goal of the meeting is to maximize the learning and contribution of the multiple NSF-funded projects enabling participants to analyze and document existing models, benchmark best practices and work cooperatively on articulating strategies that improve the quality of community and youth programming.  This gathering aims to affect programs in the development and implementation phases, thereby contributing to higher quality programs. \r\n\r\nPrincipal Investigators from a variety of institutions (museums, universities, schools, community organizations) across the country will have an opportunity to expand their thinking about program structure, assessment, staff capacity, institutional infrastructure and sustainability.  The meeting will allow participants to exchange information, interact with experts and to build relationships.  A conference report and evaluation will be published on the web and shared through regional/national conferences\r\n",
