 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth System Science (40) This project is producing inquiry-based electronic field trip modules, which will ultimately be part of a larger Geology Case Library for use in introductory geology classes.  The target audience includes both geology majors and non-majors, and future teachers. The modules present geologic principles, and also facilitate students in assuming ownership of their learning toward becoming self-sufficient, critical thinkers.  This library provides access to geology cases, data sets, and analytical tools, so that students can identify key elements of scientific problems, determine and find needed information, write clear explanations of their decisions, discuss findings, and collectively develop solutions. At the heart of the Geology Case Library modules is a set of inquiry-based tools that draw upon research into the relationships between intelligent systems and learning. These tools scaffold and organize student inquiry, provide feedback and coaching, and support collaboration and reporting.  Project software is designed to put the student in command of the learning process by guiding exploration from a background posture and providing customized feedback, dialogue, and redirection where needed.  This software can be adapted to a variety of teaching styles, and easily scaled to large audiences. The electronic format is ideally suited to the Digital Library of Earth Science Education and provides teaching that is not susceptible to changes in personnel.  Modules under development at this stage deal with rivers and faulting, as well as a Generic Case module, which allows users to create their own case modules within a framework of ideal instructional practices.",
