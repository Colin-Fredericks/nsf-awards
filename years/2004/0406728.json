 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this research is the preparation of poly(paraphenyleneethynylene)s (PPEs) via alkyne metathesis.  The goal will be the synthesis of PPEs with large chiroptical activities, PPEs that carry polymeric or conjugated side chains as novel rod-coil polymers and PPE-heterostructures for use in polymeric light emitting diodes.  Also, the absolute molecular weight of the PPEs will be determined by transformation from rigid rods into flexible coils by catalytic hydrogenation.  Further, synthetic methodology will be developed for access to polydiacetylenes and hybrids with PPEs and poly(paraphenylenevinylene)s (PPVs) by alkyne metathesis with simple in situ catalysts or defined molybdenum carbynes. Materials properties will be determined and the polymers will be exploited for device applications such as LEDs,  circularly polarized LEDs and PPE-based lasing devices.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the research of Dr. Uwe H. Bunz of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of South Carolina.  Professor Bunz will focus his work on using alkyne metathesis for the synthesis of both new and known conjugated polymers.  These polymers are attractive as stable, processable and emissive semiconductors with a wide range of potential applications.  The research is also an excellent training ground for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students.",
