Illinois\r\n\r\nThe research project proposes to undertake an effort in understanding the ferromagnetic shape memory alloys to ultimately accelerate their utilization in new power generation and sensing systems. By harnessing the change in magnetization associated with external stress and/or displacements, the work will investigate how to generate power for sensor, actuator and other devices with a wide range of applications. Experimental tools for measuring in-situ deformation and magnetization are investigated, and the mechanical and magneto-mechanical response of promising ferromagnetic shape memory materials studied. These new materials include CoNiAl, FeNiGa and CoNi in single crystalline and polycrystalline forms. The work also describes ways to improve the thermal treatment and composition of these materials so they can be utilized more reliably in applications for both sensing and power generation. The experimental results are expected to provide the constants for the magneto-mechanical model as well as screen materials. Combined as a whole, an experimental, theoretical and device design methodology program with significant potential benefits is envisioned. The project further provides an opportunity to train graduate students as well as undergraduate students in understanding transforming materials, ferromagnetism, shape memory behavior, and sensing and power generation devices.  The outreach activities will include a short course on magneto shape memory effect for engineers and collaborating with industrial and federal organizations interested in remote sensing and power generation.\r\n\r\n",
