 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sin Nombre hantavirus (SN) is a recently discovered virus carried by deermice that causes disease with high mortality in humans.  Several recent studies have proposed that human disturbance of habitat significantly affects the number of deermice infected with SN.  Given unprecedented rates of disturbance and limited understanding of the mechanisms governing variation in SN infection, a thorough study of how disturbance affects SN dynamics is warranted.  The central focus of the proposed study is to determine how human disturbance affects SN prevalence in deermice and other reservoirs. To address this issue, a multifaceted research program is proposed that includes empirical and theoretical work.  The field data will be used to determine the underlying mechanisms responsible for differences in prevalence.  These ground-based data will be used to generate predictive mathematical models of prevalence using aerial and satellite images.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this study include education, interdisciplinary research and national security. Several undergraduate and graduate students will be trained as part of this research.  The project unites scientists from diverse fields (geography, mathematics, ecology, virology).  Lastly, the research will yield critical information on the biology of Sin Nombre virus, which is listed as a biological agent of concern for national security.\r\n",
