 "awd_abstract_narration": "Closing the Mathematics Achievement Gap of African American Students: \r\nA Conference on the Issues \r\n \r\nThe National Alliance of Black School Educators (NABSE) and the Benjamin Banneker \r\nAssociation (BBA), in collaboration with The McKenzie Group (TMG), propose a four-month \r\ninitiative to develop a broad-scale action agenda to improve mathematics teaching and learning \r\nfor all students, but particularly students of African American descent.  As the first stage of a \r\nbroader plan to improve science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) \r\nachievement nationwide, the mathematics initiative seeks funding to convene a conference of \r\nnationally recognized researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to develop an integrated, \r\nresearch-based design for closing the achievement gap, as well as a framework for implementing \r\nappropriate programmatic and policy strategies. \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit:  The project will advance knowledge and understanding of effective strategies \r\nand challenges for increasing K-12 African American mathematics achievement, as well as \r\npromote collaborate among the array of organizations committed to conducting action-research \r\nto close the African American mathematics achievement gap.  NABSE and BBA, two leading \r\nadvocacy and professional development organizations committed to K-12 STEM reform, along \r\nwith TMG.s prior experience with STEM technical assistance, provide a solid grounding for this \r\nresearch and development (R&D) effort.  \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts:  The development of formal post-conference discussion and concept papers \r\nwill broaden the impact beyond the institutions and organizations represented by conference \r\nparticipants.  Furthermore, the combined memberships of over 7,500 African American \r\neducators from school districts throughout the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean will \r\nprovide a powerful professional network for sharing the conference publications and findings \r\nand directly impacting classroom instruction. NABSE.s 98 regional affiliates that are located \r\nwithin BBA.s six regions will also provide venues for continuing dialogue and collaboration at \r\nthe regional and local levels.  Both organizations will use their electronic communications \r\nnetworks that include websites and email listservs and their independent national conferences to \r\nfurther support these efforts. Finally, the overarching goal of increasing African American \r\nmathematics achievement will contribute to national education goals of improved K-12 student \r\nachievement in mathematics",
