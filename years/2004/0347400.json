Such networks will support communications over thousands of\r\nsensor nodes -- communications of a scale not seen in today's\r\nnetworks.\r\n\r\nMotivated by the physics of gases, where the behavior of individual\r\natoms are inconsequential in order to understand macroscopic behavior\r\nsuch as pressure or temperature, this CAREER project develops a research\r\nprogram based on a continuum viewpoint of a network of sensor nodes --\r\nwhere individual node properties aggregate, and manifest only as\r\nrandom fluctuations in an underlying continuous medium. By introducing\r\ntechniques from statistical physics, this proposal develops a\r\nframework for sensor network algorithm design and architecture. This\r\nis applied to obtain basic insights, and develop algorithms for sensor\r\nnetwork communications -- from network protocol primitives such as\r\nquerying, flooding and route setup, to data flow path optimization, to\r\nthe interactions of multiple data flows over wireless media, and their\r\nimpact on topological properties.\r\n\r\nResearch results impact design methodology for a wide range of sensor\r\nnetwork applications, and are incorporated into the undergraduate and\r\ngraduate curricula at UT Austin. The results are easily accessible to\r\nindustry through the Wireless Networking and Communications Group\r\nindustrial affiliates program at UT Austin. A network testbed that\r\nintegrates actual network hardware with analytical network models has\r\nbeen prototyped to measure and validate sensor network algorithms, and\r\nfurthers outreach efforts to high school students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
