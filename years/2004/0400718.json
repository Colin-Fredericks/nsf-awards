In part 1,\r\nthe PI plans to continue his study on analytic issues of calculus\r\nof variations in L-infinity consisting of the relation between absolute\r\nminimizers of L-infinity functionals and viscosity solutions of their\r\nAronsson-Euler equations which are fully nonlinear degenerate pdes,\r\nand uniqueness of viscosity of Aronsson-Euler equations. In part 2,\r\nbased on his recent works on uniqueness of viscosity solutions to\r\nthe subelliptic infinity-Laplace equation on Carnot groups, the PI\r\naims to establish the comparison principle for fully nonlinear\r\nsubelliptic pdes including subelliptic Isaas-Bellman\r\nequations and horizontal Hessian equations on Carnot-Caratheodory spaces.\r\nIn part 3, the PI plans to further study partial regularity of\r\nstationary biharmonic maps such as the optimal size and possible\r\nstructures of the singular set of biharmonic maps and the heat flow\r\nof biharmonic maps in four dimension and its applications.\r\nIn part 4, the PI plans to continue his study on weak\r\nsequential compactness and energy quantization of harmonic maps\r\nand the heat flows of harmonic maps.\r\n\r\nThe proposed problems lie in the field of nonlinear pdes which\r\nprovide basic laws and play crucial roles in studying problems\r\nfrom analysis, geometry, applied sciences. Variational problems of\r\nsupernorm are not only mathematically important but also of\r\ngreat practical interests. There are many problems from control\r\nmechanisms, risk managements in operation research, extreme value\r\nengineering where one must design for the worst case\r\n(e.g. determine a control to minimize the cost functional which is the\r\nmaximum of a function). On the other hand, since supremum norm\r\nfunctionals lack strong differentiability and their associated pdes\r\nare degenerate fully nonlinear equations, many new techniques must be\r\ndeveloped for the study. Underlying many physical phenomena is a least\r\nenergy principle where certain configurations or geometric shape are\r\ndistinguished by having less energy or area than competing objects.\r\nThe nonlinear target constraints often lead to singularities. For example,\r\ndomain walls in magnetized materials, point, curve, and surface\r\ndefects in various liquid crystal materials, and vortices in\r\nsuperconductivity. We need to develop new mathematical structures\r\nand theories in order to explain and predict such phenomena. The\r\nproposed study on harmonic maps and biharmonic maps is certainly\r\nmotivated by these considerations. The research findings in these\r\ndirections shall be very important to our knowledge of second (or higher)\r\norder nonlinear elliptic systems with borderline nonlinearities\r\nand many potential applications as well.\r\n",
