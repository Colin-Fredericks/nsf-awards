 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Division of Materials Research, the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences and the Chemistry Division jointly participate in funding this award. This award provides support for a symposium entitled \"Biological Systems and Soft Materials: future directions in statistical physics\" to be held on March 6-7, 2004, at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, in Blacksburg, VA. The symposium aims to bring researchers together with common interests in biological systems, soft materials, and statistical physics far from equilibrium. The diverse group of invited speakers includes members of underrepresented groups. Each speaker represents a strong theoretical foundation combined with an active research program in soft matter or biological systems that is closely tied to experimental data. Physicists, chemists, biologists, and engineers will report on theoretical, experimental and computational research at the meeting. Funding will primarily provide partial or full support for junior researchers enabling them to participate in the meeting. This is a timely meeting in this topical area for the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. The broader impacts of this meeting include participation of members of underrepresented groups and fertilization of ideas across several disciplines.\r\n%%%\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
