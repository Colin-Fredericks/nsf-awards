 "awd_abstract_narration": "Li\r\n\r\nThe investigator develops and analyzes mathematical models  of\r\nmosquito populations in which genetically altered mosquitoes have\r\nbeen introduced into wild mosquito populations.  The genetically\r\naltered mosquitos are resistant to infection by mosquito-borne\r\ndiseases, so their introduction into wild populations could be an\r\neffective measure in controlling mosquito-borne diseases such as\r\nmalaria, dengue fever, and West Nile virus.  He aims to\r\nunderstand the complexity of the dynamics of interacting\r\ngenetically-altered and wild mosquitoes and to predict gene\r\ndistributions in future generations of the population.  The\r\npopulation models are structured, that is, they account for both\r\ngender and genetic structure.  Within this structure, homogeneous\r\nmodels, where all transgenic (genetically-altered) mosquitoes are\r\nconsidered as a single group without distinction, heterogeneous\r\nmodels, where homozygous and heterozygous transgenic mosquitoes\r\nare distinguished, and multiple-transgenic models, where\r\ngenetically-altered mosquitoes have different transgenes, are\r\nexamined.  Within each model category, formulas for the birth\r\nfunctions and contact rates are established.  To account for data\r\ndeviations and environmental noise, the investigator formulates\r\nversions of these models that include demographic and\r\nenvironmental stochasticities.  Transmission dynamics of the\r\ndiseases are incorporated with various epidemiological models for\r\nboth human and mosquito populations.  The investigator combines\r\nanalysis and numerical simulation to study qualitative and\r\nquantitative features of the models, including existence and\r\nstability of equilibria, existence of periodic and aperiodic\r\noscillations through bifurcations, and chaotic behavior and\r\ntransient dynamics.  Model parameters are estimated or derived\r\nfrom real biological data and the mathematical analysis of the\r\nmodels covers all parameter regions. \r\n\r\nBiologists recently have been able to genetically alter\r\nmosquitoes so that they are resistant to malaria infection or\r\nother mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever and West Nile\r\nvirus.  These diseases are transmitted between humans by\r\nblood-feeding mosquitoes.  Their spread and control have been\r\nmajor concerns for public health.  The introduction of transgenic\r\n(genetically altered) mosquitoes into wild mosquito populations\r\ncould be an effective measure in controlling mosquito-borne\r\ndiseases.  To explore this possibility, the investigator in\r\ncollaboration with biologists develops and analyzes mathematical\r\nmodels that represent the population dynamics of wild and\r\ntransgenic mosquitoes.  The models account for the spread of\r\ntransgenes through the mosquito population over multiple\r\ngenerations.  They help answer such questions as how effectively\r\ntransgenic mosquitoes would be able to compete for partners with\r\ntheir wild counterparts, how long it would take for a new\r\nresistance gene to penetrate the mosquito population, and how\r\neffective it would be in mosquitoes that carry it.  In this way,\r\nthe results of the project can provide useful guidance for public\r\nhealth measures. \r\n",
