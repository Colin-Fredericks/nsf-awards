 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project is to develop an advanced hard coating process for improved wear resistance of metal-cutting tools. The approach to be used in this research is to investigate the critical process parameters for the deposition of a crystalline aluminum oxide coating using a novel physical vapor deposition process called inverted cylindrical magnetron sputtering. This work will be carried out in a collaborative effort between University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR, and Kennametal Inc., Latrobe, PA. The researchers will also work in close collaboration with the manufacturer of the deposition equipment, Isoflux, Inc., Rochester, NY, to develop and implement improved hardware designs and process modeling solutions.\r\n\r\nSuccessful development and implementation of this research will directly assist the U.S. manufacturing sector in significantly reducing manufacturing costs by providing them with improved, wear-resistant tools. The new coating technology has the potential to significantly reduce energy and environmental costs of machining, and to improve manufacturing productivity. The technology also has significant potential for applications in other fields, such as biomedical and corrosion protection applications. The university-industry collaboration also provides an outstanding opportunity for the education and training of students, by involving them in hands-on research in the laboratory combined with practical application training in the industrial research laboratory. The implementation of this research program will also provide a strong impetus to spawn new research efforts in cross-cutting research in new surface engineering technologies.",
