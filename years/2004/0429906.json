 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abtract\r\nThis project studies the average complexity of computational problems in three directions.\r\nThe first direction concerns with the notion of average NP-completeness, which was first\r\nintroduced by Levin as a tool to prove the hardness of a problem in average-case analysis.\r\nLevin's original notion of reductions for average NP-completeness, however, seems too rigid\r\nto be applied to a wide class of problems that are believed to be hard-on-average. In this\r\nproposal, a less restrictive notion of reductions is introduced, and is proposed as a new tool to\r\nprove new average NP-hard problems, including distributional function inverting problems.\r\nThe second direction of this project investigates the relations between instance com-\r\nplexity and average time-complexity. Intuitively, the average complexity of a distributional\r\nproblem is low if and only if the instance complexity of a random instance is low. Thus,\r\ninstance complexity is a useful concept in the study of average complexity. This project will\r\napply the formal notion of instance complexity, introduced by Ko et al. and closely related to\r\nKolmogorov complexity, to study average complexity. It will examine the size and distribu-\r\ntion of hard instances of average polynomial-time solvable problems, average NP-complete\r\nproblems, and pseudorandom generators.\r\nThe third area of this investigation concerns with the average complexity of numerical\r\ncomputation. Because of the continuous nature of numerical computation, the notion of\r\naverage complexity is much different from that of discrete computation. The PIs propose\r\nto extend the Turing machine-based (worst-case) complexity theory of real functions, intro-\r\nduced by Ko and Friedman, to develop a unified average complexity theory for numerical\r\ncomputation. It will focus on the relations between average complexity and randomization,\r\nand the average-case analysis of functions defined on two-dimensional domains, based on the\r\nLebesgue measure and the Hausdorff dimension/measure.\r\nIntellectual Merit. Average complexity is an important issue in analysis of algorithms.\r\nAverage completeness, instance complexity, and average complexity of real functions are\r\nfundamental concepts in computational complexity theory, as well as numerical analysis.\r\nConnections between these concepts are critical to our understanding of average complexity\r\nof hard problems, and have potential to generate major breakthrough.\r\nThe PIs are experts in these areas. They have played key roles in the introduction of the\r\nfundamental concepts and the development of the average complexity theory and complexity\r\ntheory of real functions.\r\nBroader Impact. Advances in average complexity are expected to have a substantial\r\neffect on many areas of computer science and mathematics, including analysis of algorithms,\r\nnumerical analysis, fractals and chaos theory, and pseudorandomness; and have significant\r\napplications in more practical areas of cryptography and computer security.\r\nThe PIs will integrate this research into graduate teaching. Results from this study will\r\nbe presented broadly in professional conferences and workshops, and in the form of survey\r\npapers and lecture notes. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in various\r\nactivities of this project.",
