 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports research by Professor Cassandra L. Fraser at the University of Virginia to prepare and study polymeric metal complexes (PMCs), which are metal centers with different numbers and types of pendant polymer chains including block copolymers capable of nanoscale self-assembly, to appropriately model the finely tuned metal reaction centers in proteins.  Stimuli responsive polymeric Fe, Pt, Ru, and Ln bipyridine complexes will be prepared by controlled polymerization and modular metal template synthesis to develop tunable molecular probes, imaging agents, and sensors for biological and photonic applications.  Initial targets are biocompatible ruthenium-containing polyesters prepared by metalloinitiation of lactones with alcohol initiators. Such hydrophobic, glassy polymers could serve as a protective shell for the luminophore, minimizing self-quenching and water-mediated non-radiative decay pathways, important for both biological and photonic applications. A second block can be added to Ru bpy-polylactic acids via the hydroxyl chain ends for water solubility or to produce materials that self-assemble. These block copolymers can be designed to form pH sensitive micelles, vesicles, and hydrogels with built-in fluorescent tags, useful for monitoring location and degradation in biological contexts.   \r\n\r\nNew polymers containing metal ions are targeted for synthesis and study as biocompatible and photonic materials.  Interdisciplinary collaborations in this research and participation in programs crossing the sciences, engineering, medicine, and the humanities will be undertaken to enhance the scientific infrastructure and aid in the progress of women and underrepresented minorities in science. \r\n",
