One can think for example of the wake of an \r\nairfoil as a typical problem\r\nof this type. This problem can be described by the incompressible Euler \r\nequations, where\r\nthe initial vorticity is ideally a finite Radon measure supported on a \r\ncurve. The issue is to determine\r\nthe evolution of this curve. A further assumption that the vortex sheet \r\nremains a\r\ncurve at a later time leads to the Birkhoff-Rott equation. The PI's \r\ninitial study\r\nshows that a vortex sheet\r\nin general can not be a curve of reasonable regularity. On the other \r\nhand, Delort's result shows that vortex sheet\r\nfits as a weak solution of the Euler equation (for initially \r\nnon-negative vorticity). However weak\r\nsolutions seem to be a class too big to describe the\r\nspecific nature  of the vortex sheet evolution. The proposed research \r\nfocuses on further pin point the\r\nnature of the vortex sheet evolution, through studying similarity \r\nspiral solutions, understanding the viscosity effects and\r\nthe evolution of vortex layers.\r\n\r\nWater wave is one of our most familiar experiences in daily life.  A \r\nmathematical description\r\nis the incompressible, irrotational Euler equation, defined in the \r\nmoving water domain. Study of  water\r\nwave can be traced back to more than 150 years, in which the PI \r\nrecently established\r\n  the well-posedness of the problem locally in time, that is, the wave \r\nwill evolute\r\nwithout breaking for a finite time period, from\r\nany initially non-self intersecting wave surface. The proposed research \r\nfocuses on the large time behavior:\r\nthe global existence of smooth solutions, the wave breaking-- the \r\nmechanisms that cause the\r\nwave breaking and breaking profiles. The proposal is to initiate from \r\nexisting theories on limit equations.\r\nThrough comparisons of the full water wave equation with the limit \r\nequations, the\r\nPI aims at developing enough\r\nmachinery and understanding\r\nthat lead to further research with greater generality.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will further our understanding of the nature \r\nphenomena such as the water wave\r\nmotion and wave breaking,  the mixing of fluids, separation of boundary \r\nlayers, generation of\r\nsounds and coherent structures\r\nin turbulence models. It will have a direct impact on the science and \r\ntechnology that influence our daily life.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
