 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this expanded cross-industry survey/study is to assess and compile key development, commercialization and integration trends for a significantly larger cross-section of companies involved in the rapidly evolving nanomanufacturing industry, which are estimated to number around 800 companies in the US (per an industry compilation by Small Times magazine).  NCMS is aiming to obtain at least 300 representative industry responses from established conventional manufacturing industry, new nanomanufacturing industries, and other start-up companies in North America. NCMS will make its best efforts to amplify industry information via an on-line survey questionnaire, as well as identify new success stories and emerging in-progress efforts in applications of nanomanufacturing towards commercialization.  NCMS will first distribute the survey to its corporate membership (numbering over 150 organizations from aerospace, automotive, machine-tool, electronics and advanced materials) and then to the nanomanufacturing industry at large during the spring and summer of 2004, for which the database will be provided by NSF.  NCMS will also disseminate the survey solicitation more widely through its web publications, periodic newsletters and alliances in order to encourage participation in the survey, as well as contact leading media, regional and technical business organizations to encourage responses.",
