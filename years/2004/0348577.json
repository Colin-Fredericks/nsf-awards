 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER proposal, supported in the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, addresses questions of the reactivity of organic thin films with \"open shell\" atomic and radical reactants.  Professor Kandel and his coworkers at the University of Notre Dame, are examining the reactions of functionalized self assembled thiol monolayers with atomic reactants such as hydrogen and oxygen.  Reactivity is probed by examining the reacted surface with Auger electron spectroscopy, thermal desorption spectroscopy, and scanning tunneling microscopy.  As part of this research project, Kandel will develop an undergraduate course that focusses on the construction of a simple scanning tunneling microscope, demonstrating the process of instrument design while illustrating important concepts in solid state and surface science.  The results of this research activity provide fundamental understanding of gas-surface reaction processes important in electronic materials processing, in plasmas, flames, and upper atmosphere chemistry. \r\n\r\nWith the support of the Analytical and Surface Chemistry Program, Professor Kandel and his coworkers at Notre Dame are investigating the interaction of reactive atomic and radical species with model organic thin films.  The results of these studies provide fundamental information about the gas-surface reaction chemistry of organic surfaces important in lubrication, electronic devices, polymer surfaces, and combustion environments.  The educational aspect of this CAREER award includes the development of a course focussing on instrument design.",
