 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative, NSF 03-043, category NIRT.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposal aims at studying a range of electronic devices that integrate ordered arrays of functional molecules onto nanopatterned surfaces, which present unique applications and truly underpin the development of nanotechnology. Ferroelectric materials are characterized by a spontaneous, reversible polarization. The presence of a large polarization implies that one can achieve unique surfaces with a controllable combination of surface charge, surface potential, and surface dipole, which can be exploited in patterning and nanoassembly. The fact that the polarization is reversible implies that surface patterns can be written with these features. Here, it is proposed to use scanned probe techniques to create such patterns in ferroelectrics with nanoscale resolution, and use these patterns as templates to drive a variety of self-assembly processes.  \r\nCentral to our understanding of how patterned surfaces can be used as supports and atomically precise templates is resolving how  surface properties dictate monolayer  growth, crystallinity, and functionality.  The first steps towards creating functional nanoscale structures involve grasping how to exploit chemical and physical interactions at the molecular level and determine the degree of correlation between surface properties and single molecule or aggregate interactions.  These issues of coherent organization or self-assembly of surface bound molecules impact a broad  range of physical phenomena from single molecule device design to heterogeneous catalysis  to functional opto-electronic materials. This NIRT will support four interrelated  tasks,  which  range  from  patterning  and  control  of  the  ferroelectric  surface  to exploring the fundamental science of molecular attachment and the specifics of two novel molecular  patterned  surface  structures  including  liquid  crystalline  molecules  and  molecular \r\nrotators.   \r\nBroader Impact: The program has an integrated educational and outreach program that begins with the six graduate students, four undergraduate students, and one post-doc working directly on the research projects. The research will impact newly developed graduate courses, and we are proposing to initiate a new series of interdisciplinary short courses.  In addition, the PIs will develop and integrate hands-on nanotechnology modules from the NIRT into UG chemistry and physics courses through the SCALE-UP approach. This will also involve existing REU site programs in Chemistry and Physics. An AFM will be purchased in support of the undergraduate  education initiatives.  The program will link into another innovative NSF-initiated program (Technology Entrepreneurship  and  Education)  to  evaluate  and  develop  commercialization  activities  based upon the research of this NIRT.",
