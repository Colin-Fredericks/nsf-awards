However, several practical and fundamental issues, critical to the\r\ncomplete solution, will also be investigated. These include sensor calibration/validation, defect\r\nand fault tolerance through redundancy and reconfiguration, and signal interpolation in scenarios\r\nwhere the data rates from the various heterogeneous sensors are disparate. The urgency of this\r\nproject arises from the fact that while sensor research is advancing rapidly, the extraction of\r\ninformation and fusion of multi-modal sensor data in real time is not keeping pace. To harness the\r\nfull power of networked sensors, such processing capability, resident at the sensor nodes, is\r\nimperative.\r\nBroader Impacts: Intelligent sensor systems are of critical importance to the nations security\r\nand economic growth. Graduate students will be involved in this research, one or more of whom\r\nwill be supported by the grant funds. Special effort will be made to recruit women, minority, or\r\ndisabled students to fill these research positions. It is also useful to remark that the project will\r\nsignificantly benefit two graduate courses: a unique graduate course that is under development\r\nby the PI, namely Heterogeneous System on a Chip, which is aimed to fulfill a serious national\r\nneed; and a Low Power VLSI Design course being developed by the Co-PI which has a project\r\nbased learning component.",
