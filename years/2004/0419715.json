 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will focus on the development of high-performance hydrocarbon reforming catalysts for fuel processors of fuel cell systems.  The objective of this research project is to determine feasibility of novel composite materials approach for development of reforming catalysts with high activity for hydrocarbon reforming reactions, resistance to degradation via carbon deposition, and tolerance to sulfur   impurities in the hydrocarbon fuels.  The approach is based on the identification of formulations and use of synthesis methods to provide ultimate dispersion of catalytic metals within a stable support material that contributes to the reforming reactions.  The Phase I research results will establish an approach for designing highly active and durable catalysts for use in fuel cell systems operating on existing fuels such as natural gas, propane, diesel, gasoline, and aviation   fuels.        \r\n\r\nNew energy systems are required that can operate on fossil fuels and generate less greenhouse gases and polluting emissions.  The proposed program supports the nation's goals of increasing energy efficiency, reducing polluting   emissions, and reducing the use of imported energy resources to meet U.S. needs.  The proposed catalyst technology is applicable to a number of power generation applications in residential, industrial, automotive, and military markets. \r\n",
