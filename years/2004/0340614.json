Specifically, their goals are to (1) develop an advanced multiscale model of processes leading to nanoparticle formation in laser ablation of organic materials and metals and (2) perform comprehensive computational investigations of the parameters that control the evolution of the velocity, size, and spatial distributions of the ejected particles in the ablation plume. Understanding the mechanisms of nanoparticle generation in laser ablation is important for optimizing experimental conditions and for nano material fabrication or deposition of metal particles for catalysis.  The project takes advantage of French experimental expertise in lasers and computational research.\r\n\r\nThe project integrates research and education in computational materials science and includes training of graduate students in international multidisciplinary research.  The investigators plan to integrate their research results into a graduate course on modeling in materials science.  \r\n\r\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) jointly support this project.  NSF will cover the costs of visits to France by the U.S. investigator and graduate students.  The CNRS will provide support to the French investigator for visits to the United States.  \r\n",
