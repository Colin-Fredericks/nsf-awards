 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate and quantify the importance of nocturnal atmospheric dynamics and chemistry in an urban environment, with emphasis on the chemistry of reactive oxidized oxides of nitrogen, oxidizing radicals and heterogeneous reaction processes.  During two field studies differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) along with ancillary measurements provided by in situ instruments (including an aerosol mass spectrometer), GPS radiosondes, and a light detection and ranging (lidar) will be used to characterize nighttime chemistry and mixing.  One- and three-dimensional modeling experiments will place those observations in a policy-relevant context by defining the role of nocturnal vertical mixing processes in controlling chemical reactions and air quality in urban areas.  The broader science impact of this research will be an improved understanding of nighttime chemical reactions and mixing processes so that they can be emulated in a more representative fashion within urban and regional air quality models.  Such improvements will lead to more effective control strategies and informed policy decisions in the future.  In addition to direct mentoring of graduate and undergraduate student research the P.I. will integrate his research into a number of education and community outreach initiatives.  Support is requested for one graduate student and this project will contribute substantially to their professional training.",
