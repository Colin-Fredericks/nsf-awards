 "awd_abstract_narration": "The chemical mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed reactions with O2 are of particular interest, both because of the importance of O2 to living organisms, and because reactions between O2 and organic molecules  are formally forbidden by the rules of quantum mechanics.   In order to facilitate reactions with O2, nature has evolved enzymes that contain cofactors, either organic or inorganic, which readily react with O2.  The enzyme urate oxidase is quite unusual in that it requires O2 as a substrate, but neither contains nor requires any cofactor.  The research outlined is designed to provide a detailed understanding of how urate oxidase facilitates the  reaction  between  O2 and urate.  A small but growing number  of enzymes has been recognized to catalyze reactions with O2 in the absence of cofactors. The urate oxidase reaction will be probed by measuring 13C, 18O, and 35S isotope effects on substrate oxidation and on the binding of ligands at the active site.  Binding isotope effects will be particularly  useful for determining how hydrogen-bonding interactions at the active site influence the reactivity of urate.  Kinetic isotope effects will help to define the mechanism that urate oxidase employs to enhance the reactivity of urate towards O2.  One can envision several means that could be used in the enzymatic reaction.  Model studies have shown that the urate dianion can be oxidized readily, and  evidence from kinetic studies suggests that urate oxidase does generate the urate dianion at the active site.  Since the product of the urate oxidase reaction contains a tetrahedral carbon at C5 while the substrate is planar, the enzyme could also enhance the reactivity of urate by contorting it away from planarity.  The enzyme can also vary hydrogen-bonding and pi-stacking interactions with the ligand, to vary its redox potential.  All of these mechanisms are expected to generate heavy atom kinetic isotope effects.  Furthermore, if binding does induce deformation of the substrate or introduce unique hydrogen bonds, there should be equilibrium  isotope  effects  on the binding  of  ligands  to  urate  oxidase.   Interpretation  of  the isotope  effect  data  will be  facilitated  by  comparison  with  calculated  isotope  effects.   Ab  initio calculations  will  be  performed  to  generate  wave functions  for  urate  and  urate  analogs participating in molecular interactions that are expected to occur at the active site.   \r\nThe model proposed for the urate oxidase reaction draws parallels with flavin and pterin cofactor chemistry.  Since urate is a substrate rather than a cofactor, isotope effect methodologies can be applied to urate oxidase in ways that are not practical with flavoenzymes or pterin-dependent enzymes.  However, the  fundamental insights gained should allow of a greater understanding of the chemistry between O2 and flavin and pterin as well.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts\r\n\r\nThis project will promote teaching and training of graduate and undergraduate students through hands on research experience. These research experiences will be directed to learning mechanistic enzymology and protein chemistry.\r\n",
