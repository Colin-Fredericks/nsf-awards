 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to SUNY College at Oswego under the direction of Dr. Anthony Ouellette for the support of a new mass spectrometry and proteomics facility.  This facility will house a Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization - Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer, equipment to separate and analyze protein mixtures, and provide computer resources for data analysis (bioinformatics), including protein and gene sequence database searching. The masses of molecules and complexes can reveal much about their structure and composition. Mass spectrometry is a powerful component of proteomics, which is a broad area of research dealing with the complement of proteins in a given cell at a given time (the proteome). Proteomic tools are utilized to help answer questions in many disciplines, from ecology and evolution, to physiology and medicine. Various investigators, including undergraduates, graduate students, and professors, will utilize the facility at SUNY-Oswego for training, research, and teaching, in an integrative, interdisciplinary setting.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of a MALDI-TOF will play a significant role in modernizing the Chemistry and Biology Departments, greatly expand the possibilities for course and research offerings, and will strengthen biochemistry, molecular, and cellular biology at SUNY-Oswego. The center will provide a hub for sample preparation and analysis for a variety of molecules, including biological macromolecules and inorganic complexes. The use of software to analyze data will provide training in bioinformatics. The facility will be utilized in current and planned research projects concerning metal-ion complexes, algae toxins, antibiotics, insulin, small mammal enzymes, microorganism fingerprinting, protein identification, model peptide characterization, and DNA-nanotube complexes. Mass spectrometry is a powerful teaching tool as it applies to chemistry, physics, and structural considerations for macromolecules and complexes. Therefore, the facility will be utilized in a variety of biology and chemistry courses, from freshmen to masters' levels.\r\n\r\nThe increasing importance of mass spectrometry in a variety of disciplines makes the impact of such a facility far reaching. SUNY-Oswego is a public, primarily undergraduate institution with approximately 8,500 students enrolled. The creation of this facility will greatly enhance the research and education infrastructure at SUNY-Oswego. Acquisition of the MALDI-TOF will provide crucial support for a broad range of undergraduate research projects and will provide opportunities for meaningful research that would not otherwise exist. Use of this instrumentation by freshmen as well as in upper level chemistry and biology courses and undergraduate research ensures that a large number of university level students will benefit. Furthermore, collaboration between the University and local high schools will make this facility available to high school teachers and their classes. This will serve the local community, and will we believe will encourage more students to pursue science as a career.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
