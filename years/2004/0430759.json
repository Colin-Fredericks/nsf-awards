 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to request financial support for approximately 20 US researchers to travel to the Second International Workshop and Conference on thermal, fluid and interfacial phenomena in physico-chemical, materials and bio- processes in Brussels, July 14-17, 2004.   These scientists represent a broad base of research funded by NSF, through its Chemical and Transport Systems Division.  The participants will receive partial travel support, with the expectation that the remainder will be provided either from the participant's own funds or the participant's institution.  NSF supported the first such conference in 2001.  However, the disruption of travel in the fall of 2001 prevented many US participants from attending, and a second meeting was held involving US scientists during March of 2002.  The proceedings of the two conferences have been published in a volume published by Springer-Verlag.  The Broad Impacts of this proposal include wide dissemination through a formal publication of the proceedings, the opportunity for a wide spectrum of scientists from the US to establish cooperative activities in the future, and the re-establishment of this conference venue after the disruption caused by the September, 2001 attacks. \r\n\r\nThis award has been funded jointly by three programs in the Chemical and Transport Systems Division:  the Thermal Transport and Thermal Processing Program, the Interfacial, Transport and Thermodynamics Program, and the Fluid Dynamics and Hydraulics Program. \r\n",
