 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is currently considerable uncertainty in the global budget of carbon tetrachloride, an anthropogenic compound important by virtue of its acute toxicity and impact on global climate (leading to commercial production being restricted by the Montreal Protocol).  It is likely that previous source and/or sink estimates for carbon tetrachloride may be in error or at least highly uncertain.  This study involves a seasonal program of field measurements of carbon tetrachloride uptake fluxes into soil at a number of climatically diverse surface sites coupled with parallel laboratory studies characterizing biological uptake mechanisms.  The project involves collaboration between a university and a federal government laboratory.  Results from this study will advance our understanding of the atmospheric budget of carbon tetrachloride by better characterizing the influence of soil dynamics on the sink term of atmospheric in the global carbon tetrachloride budget.  Broader impacts of this research include the societal benefit to science through advances in understanding in a highly climate- and policy- relevant issue.  Contributions to education include research training and professional development opportunities for a number of students.",
