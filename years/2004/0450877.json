This year's symposium will take\r\nplace in Lisbon, Portugal, December 5-8, 2004.\r\nThis award provides support for student travel grants, and to partially fund the creating of an \"anniversary DVD,\" which will contain the first 25 RTSS proceedings, as well as the .rst 10 RTAS proceedings. RTAS - the Real-time and Embedded Technology and Application Symposium - is a sister conference of RTSS that is also devoted to issues involving real-time and embedded systems. Since both conferences are marking milestone anniversaries this year, this is an appropriate time to look back at what has been accomplished in the area of real-time and\r\nembedded systems over the last 25 years.\r\n\r\nThe travel grants enable approximately 20 young researchers in the ?eld of embedded and real-time systems to attend RTSS 2004. The DVD will help in disseminating the results of this year's symposium and will be a valuable research tool, as it will allow content searches to be conducted over all 35 stored proceedings. The DVD will also give young researchers direct access to many of the landmark papers in the area of real-time and embedded computing. \r\n\r\n",
