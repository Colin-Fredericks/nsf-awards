 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n0325639\r\nGoldsmith, Andrea\r\nStanford University\r\n\r\nAn ad-hoc wireless network is a collection of possibly mobile wireless nodes that self-configure to form a\r\nnetwork without the aid of any established infrastructure. The lack of infrastructure is extremely compelling\r\nfor applications where a communications infrastructure is too expensive to deploy, cannot be deployed\r\nquickly, or is simply not feasible. Such applications range from multi-hop wireless broadband Internet\r\naccess to sensor networks to building or highway automation to voice, image, and video communication for\r\nemergency response, a life-saving capability urgently needed by our society. The nature of ad-hoc wireless\r\nnetworks makes support of delay-critical applications such as voice and video quite challenging. In this\r\nproject the investigators study a new framework for ad-hoc wireless network design to support such delay-\r\ncritical applications. The framework includes dynamic allocation of network resources to support media\r\nrequirements, protocols that are robust to variations and uncertainties in the network, and adaptive media\r\ncompression techniques that preserve end-to-end network connectivity even when network conditions are\r\npoor. The results of the project are expected to have a significant impact on the development of future\r\nwireless networks and the enabling of critical applications.\r\nThe framework being developed to support delay-critical applications in ad-hoc wireless networks is based\r\non cross-layer design across the network protocol stack. The design incorporates adaptation across multiple\r\nprotocol layers, including the application, transport, network, and link layers. Within this framework, the\r\ninvestigators develop a suite of new techniques to balance network congestion and distortion of real-time\r\nmedia streams by jointly optimizing error-resilient source coding, packet scheduling, stream-based routing, link capacity assignment, and adaptive link layer techniques. The optimization is carried out dynamically by all nodes, based on link state communication, to continuously adapt to changing link and trac conditions.\r\nThe research project systematically investigates these new ideas and ultimately demonstrates them in a small\r\ntestbed.",
