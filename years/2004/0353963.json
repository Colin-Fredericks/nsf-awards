 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Physics Department at Wright State University (WSU) enjoys strong and production collaboration with the Air Force Institutte of Technology (AFIT) and several research groups associated with the Air Force Base (WPAFB), in close proximity to WSU.  This REU Site utilizes these collaborations to allow ten undergraduate students to join ongoing research efforts at WSU and WPAFB for a ten-week program during the summer.  Each student is mentored by a WSU or AFIT faculty member or an AFRL research scientist on a project that focuses on the experimental or computational aspects of basic and applied research in atomic, molecular and optical physics, chemical physics, plasma physics, solid state physics, materials science, and biological physics.  The summer research experience also includes workshops to complement the research projects, weekely participant meetings that inlclude a series of seminars exploring the research areas, educational opportunities and careers in the physical sciences, tours of area laboratories and facilities, poster and research presentations by the participants and several social activities.  Students are encouraged to present research results during the academic year at an appropriate professional meeting.  This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",
