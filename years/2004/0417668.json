 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sex stereotypes are ubiquitous (Ashmore, Del Boca and Wohlers, 1986; Broverman et al.,  1972; Williams and Best, 1990), and lead people to perceive men as possessing agentic traits  such as boldness and aggressiveness, while women are perceived as possessing communal traits  such as warmth and sympathy (McKee and Sheriffs, 1957, 1958; Parsons and Bales, 1955).  In  the context of modern political campaigns, where negative campaigning is on the rise (e.g.,  Mayer, 1996; Johnson-Cartee and Copeland, 1991; Ansolabehere and Iyengar, 1995), and is  often viewed as an effective strategy (see Finkel and Geer, 1998; Kahn and Kenney, 1999;  Freedman and Goldstein, 1999; Brians and Wattenberg, 1996), examining how stereotypes  influence the impact of negative campaigning is an important question.      \r\nTo examine this question, a content analysis will be conducted to examine gender  differences in the reliance on negative advertisements in congressional campaigns, using 1998  and 2000 data from the Wisconsin Advertising Project and the Campaign Media Analysis Group  (CMAG).  To examine differences in the effectiveness of negative campaigns for men and  women candidates, an innovative experiment will be implemented.  Political commercials will be  created and shown to subjects in an experimental setting; and four factors will be varied in the  commercials: (1) the gender of the sponsor of the ad; (2) the tone of the ad; (3) the gender of the  target of the ad; and (4) the content of the ad, creating a 2 (tone) x 2 (sponsor gender) x 2 (target  gender) x 4 (content) factorial design.  By only varying the independent variables of interest, and  by keeping all other content the same in each of the commercials, the differences in subjects.  evaluations of the candidates can be attributed to the variation in the independent variables.   Finally, an examination on whether the subjects. political and demographic background (e.g.,  political party, race, gender) condition the impact that stereotypes have on their reaction to  negative campaigning will be examined.     \r\nThe intellectual merit of the dissertation project is that first, it builds on the psychological  literature that examines gender stereotypes by revising ideas about the substance, pervasiveness,  and consequences of gender stereotypes.  Second, it builds on the political science and  communication literature that examines negative campaigning by improving scholars  understanding of the effectiveness of different types of political messages for different political  candidates.  The broader impacts resulting from the project include a deeper understanding of  how effective negative campaigns are for women congressional candidates.  Since research  shows that women politicians often expand the legislative agenda (Clark, 1998; Dodson, 1998;  Mandel and Dodson, 1992; Thomas, 1994; Thomas and Welch, 1991), and are successful at  addressing issues that get short shrift by male officeholders (e.g., women and children.s issues)  (Dodson et al., 1995; Dodson 1995; Schreiber 1995; Witt, Paget, and Matthews, 1994),  increasing the number of women in elective office is an important goal in our representative  democracy.  Therefore, it is necessary to explore the obstacles women face when running for  office.  In this study, by examining how gender stereotypes influence the impact of negative  campaigns, women.s likelihood of increasing their electoral presence will be examined.    \r\n",
