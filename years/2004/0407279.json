 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to the University of Connecticut supports a multidisciplinary team, Professors Faquir Jain, John Ayers, R. Magnusson, and Rajeev Bansal, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and  F. Papadimitrakopoulos, Institute of Materials Science, and B. Sinkovic, Department of Physics, for their work to prepare Engineering and Science majors for a future role in industries impacted by nanotechnology. This will be accomplished through the following steps: (1) develop teaching modules to introduce basic nanoscience and nanotechnology (NSNT) concepts in an existing core of four lower division (Freshmen and Sophomore) courses, (2) develop teaching modules for strengthening nanostructures concepts in four existing Core Courses and four Professional Elective (PE/PR) upper division (Junior and Senior) courses, (3) create two new team-taught upper division NSNT courses, and (4) provide Senior Design experience in Nanotechnology. The teaching modules, new NSNT course material (including dedicated software), and laboratory training will be available to institutions participating in Connecticut Microelectronics and Optoelectronics Consortium (CMOC) [Trinity College, Yale University, Southern Connecticut State University, and U. Bridgeport and 18 industrial members], and also to research collaborators, Prof. W. Huang (Electrical Engineering Dept., US Military Academy, West Point, NY) and Prof. S. K. Islam (Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN).  \r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education (NSEE) announcement, NS 03-044, category NUE and was jointly funded by the Division of Chemical and Transport Systems (CTS), Directorate for Engineering (ENG), Division of Materials Research, the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physcial Sciences (MPS), and the Diectorate for Computer and Information Sciences and Engineering (CISE)",
