Evans, Principal Investigator, Florida A&M University\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to increase the number of minority students pursuing M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science by enhancing the research infrastructure of the Department of Computer and Information Sciences. The holistic approach reflects a commitment to enhancing all aspects of the student experience that have an impact on the ability to produce highly qualified graduates capable of pursuing graduate degrees in computing: strong academic programs and instruction, career mentoring, diverse faculty research, mentored student research, and computing resources for education and research. The Student Success Assurance component promotes graduate study as a desirable and achievable option for capable students, and it supports students through workshops, mentoring, advisement, and paid positions for research or instructional support. The Research Productivity Enhancement component seeks to evolve four strong, sustainable research programs through strategic collaboration across disciplines and institutions: Software Engineering (specification-based testing); Security and Information Assurance (intrusion detection, privacy and accountability); Intelligent Computing (HCI assistive technology, knowledge/agent based computing and informatics); Scientific Computing (parallel and high performance computing architectures and algorithms for scientific research and computing, e.g., nano-technology). The Computer Facilities Enhancement component will upgrade computing resources for instruction and research, including establishing a Security and Robotics Laboratory.  The broader impacts of this project include increased participation of minorities in graduate study in computing and the dissemination of a model for attracting and preparing students for graduate study.\r\n",
