 "awd_abstract_narration": "Meristems are groups of cells that control the initiation of organs in plants. Axillary meristems are so called because they arise at the junction or axil between the leaf and the stem. Axillary meristems give rise to branches and flowers and therefore play a key role in plant architecture and reproduction. In maize, axillary meristems give rise to the ear shoots which produce the food source that is harvested.  Axillary meristems are critically important for plant growth and development yet how they initiate and grow is poorly understood. The aim of this proposal is to determine the mechanism by which axillary meristems initiate in maize.\r\n\r\nTwo key players in the initiation of axillary meristems have been identified. The barren inflorescence2 (bif2) gene is an important regulator of axillary meristem initiation in maize. The plant growth hormone, auxin, also plays a critical role in axillary meristem initiation. The aim of this proposal is to use biochemical, genetic, molecular and physiological approaches to determine the mechanism by which bif2 controls the initiation of axillary meristems in maize. The proposed research will determine how bif2 interacts with auxin and will result in the identification of additional genes and proteins that interact with bif2 in the control of axillary meristem initiation in maize.\r\n\r\nThis proposal will provide training for one postdoctoral researcher and additional undergraduate students. The research is on a basic fundamental process, initiation of ear shoots and flowers, in maize which is an important crop in the US. Besides advancing understanding of an important mechanism in plant development, the research also has potential practical applications for crop improvement.\r\n",
