 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award in the Inorganic, Bioinorganic and Organometallic Chemistry program supports Professor Bryan Eichhorn at the University of Maryland to synthesize and study the properties of a new class of ligand-free inorganic binary clusters comprising catalytically-active transition metals and heavy group 14 and group 15 elements.  Oxidation of these complexes in solution yields bimetallic nanoparticles with improved selectivity in heterogeneous catalytic applications.  The research aims at developing catalysts with bifunctional activities through the use of active supports or multi-component catalyst particles, and the room temperature synthesis of different phases of alloy nanoparticles.  The project will investigate the chemistry of catalytic processes of bimetallic catalysts including those for CO oxidation and lean NOx  reduction in O2-rich exhaust gases.  \r\n\r\nMonometallic and bimetallic nanoparticles are used in a wide variety of applications including optical devices, magnetic nanostructures, and electronic devices.  This research will provide synthetic methodologies for bimetallic molecular precursors to advance the technology of heterogenous catalysts.  Graduate students, undergraduate students and postdoctoral associates will receive excellent training in synthetic materials methodology and the study of bimetallic heterogeneous catalysts.",
