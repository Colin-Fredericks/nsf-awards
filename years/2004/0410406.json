 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop a set of tools capable of performing\r\ntruly localized Fourier analysis and synthesis of objects of interest in a given\r\nimage that have smooth boundaries but of general shape. To do so, we will bring\r\nin tools in the traditionally different fields such as boundary detection and \r\ndelineation algorithms (computer vision), image compression and denoising \r\nschemes (image processing), elliptic boundary value problem solvers and \r\npotential function computations (scientific computing), and Fourier analysis and\r\nfast algorithms (computational harmonic analysis).  Our primary concern is \r\nanalysis (e.g., extraction and characterization of spatial frequency features)\r\nand synthesis (e.g., reconstruction from the compressed representation of \r\nobjects after their boundaries are detected and they are segmented either \r\nmanually by a human interpreter using a pointing device or automatically by the\r\nalgorithms proposed by other researchers.  On the one hand, the boundary of an\r\nobject provides important information: geometry and shape of the object. On the\r\nother hand, it becomes a nuisance for other tasks such as the Fourier analysis\r\nof the internal information (e.g., textures) of the object because it creates\r\nspurious interference patterns due to the Gibbs phenomenon that masks the\r\nimportant internal information of the object.  We will decouple the geometry and\r\ninternal information of the object by solving the elliptic boundary value \r\nproblem on the domain where the object is supported.  More precisely, for the \r\nanalysis of the object, we embed the detected and segmented object in an \r\notherwise empty rectangular domain, and smoothly extend the object to the \r\noutside of the object boundary by solving the Poisson equation with the \r\nhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition at the edges of the covering rectangle.\r\nSince the values on the edges of the covering rectangle vanish, this smoothly\r\nextended component can be expanded into the Fourier sine series with quickly \r\ndecaying coefficients, which enable us to effectively characterize and compress\r\nthe internal information of the object.  Finally, we subtract this component\r\nfrom the original object on the supported domain to obtain the component \r\nresponsible for geometric information of the object, which turns out to be a \r\nsolution of the Laplace equation on that domain.  For the synthesis or \r\nreconstruction of the object, we need to store the Fourier sine coefficients of\r\nthe extended component and the boundary coordinates and the original values of \r\nthe object at those points in the analysis stage.  Then, the original object is \r\nrecovered by adding the geometric component (which is recovered by evaluating \r\nthe single and double layer potentials on the domain) and the smoothly extended\r\ncomponent (which is easily recovered from the Fourier sine coefficients).  In \r\norder to solve the Laplace/Poisson equations, we will fully utilize the advanced\r\nLaplace/Poisson solvers based on Fast Multipole Methods.  We will also extend \r\nour analysis and synthesis paradigm to an object with holes (i.e., \r\nmultiply-connected domains), investigate the effect of noise on the boundary \r\nshapes and values, and investigate the effect of compression of the boundary \r\ninformation to the quality of the reconstructed images.  Furthermore, we will\r\ndevelop a gradient and directional derivative estimation algorithm equipped with\r\nregularization (high-frequency attenuation) capabilities, which will provide \r\ngood boundary conditions and consequently improve the performance of the \r\nboundary detection and delineation algorithms as well as the accuracy of the \r\nsolutions of the Laplace/Poisson equations.\r\n\r\nPotential applications of our methodology include biometrics and image-based \r\ndiagnostics in medicine and other fields such as geology and material sciences.\r\nBiometrics has recently become a tremendously important subject for homeland \r\nsecurity reasons.  Since our paradigm provides both geometric/shape information\r\nand internal texture information of an object of interest in an separate manner\r\nfor images obtained by various sensors and imaging modalities, it may allow data\r\nexaminers to characterize the features of the objects of interest much more \r\nreliably compared to the methods which solely use either shape or texture \r\ninformation.  For example, characterizing and diagnosing cancerous cells in \r\nvarious image modalities including Pap smear test images in gynecology may \r\nbenefit from using the tools we will develop in our project (e.g., object-based \r\nstorage, cataloging, compression, and analysis).  Similarly, extracting \r\nquantitative information from optical images of sections of rock core samples \r\n(e.g., the size and internal texture/spatial frequency information of some \r\nfossils), which is important in earth science including oil and gas exploration \r\nindustry, may also benefit from our research.  We envision that scientists in \r\ncompletely different disciplines such as medicine, biology, and geology, will \r\nstart noticing the importance of computational harmonic analysis and certain \r\npartial differential equations (PDEs) if they use our tools to be developed in\r\nthis project and feel that these are useful for their own tasks.  This is a \r\ngreat thing we, as applied and computational mathematicians, can hope for.\r\nIn terms of the educational impact, this project will create a common meeting\r\nground among students in the different fields: applied mathematics, computer \r\nscience, electrical engineering, statistics, and neuroscience.  We expect lively\r\ninterchanges of ideas among such students who will participate in this research\r\nproject or attend the associated courses and seminars we are developing.  \r\nStudents participating in our project will also learn computational harmonic \r\nanalysis, the basic theory and fast computational algorithms of certain PDEs, \r\nand image analysis, which will become indispensable for the future applied \r\nmathematicians and scientists working in the area of imaging science, and which\r\nwill be surely helpful for their future career, either in academia or in industry.\r\n",
