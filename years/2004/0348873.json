 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Experimental Physical Chemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Franz Geiger of Northwestern University will seek molecular level information on chromium species interacting with surface groups, with adsorbed and interfacial organic molecules, and water.  Such knowledge is essential to achieve an understanding of the interactions of chromium with soil and model relevant aqueous/solid interfaces.  This information is of great importance in dealing with a major environmental problem, namely the presence of toxic metals in soils and water.\r\n\r\nThis research will provide opportunities for participation by undergraduate students.  Among the several outreach activities, Professor Geiger will couple his activities to the Environmental Law and Policy Center (ELPC), a Chicago-based non-profit organization, will invite local high school chemistry teachers into a laboratory focusing on environmental science, and develop teaching modules for use in secondary schools in his area with high minority student representation\r\n",
