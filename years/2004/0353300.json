 "awd_abstract_narration": "Travel Grant to 5th International PhD Symposium in Civil Engineering \r\nTU Delft, The Netherlands ,CMS project 0353300\r\n\r\nPI: Reginald Des Roches,  GA Tech\r\n\r\nThis proposal is to provide travel fellowships for approximately 8-10 graduate students to attend \r\nthe 5th International PhD Symposium in Civil Engineering, in Delft, The Netherlands, in June, \r\n2004.  The symposium is the 5th, in a sequence of successful symposiums that began in 1996 in \r\nBudapest.   The symposium is a great opportunity to have students highlight the results of their \r\nresearch and interact with students from all over the world.   \r\n \r\nThe objectives of the Symposium are to:\r\n\tProvide a forum to exchange ideas and research results for PHD Students \r\n\tDiscuss the results of ongoing research \r\n\tProvide opportunities for PhD students to establish scientific relationships  \r\n\tCompare PhD programs in various countries \r\n\tExcite students about academia in this critical stage of their careers \r\n\r\nStudents will be recruited from Universities all over the United States.  Attempts will be made to \r\nhave a diverse group of students selected for the fellowships (in terms of research topics, \r\nregional representation, and cultural diversity).   Special efforts will be made to attract talented \r\nstudents from smaller and non-traditional universities, as well as students from \r\nunderrepresented groups.   \r\n \r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed travel grant are that it will provide graduate students an \r\nopportunity to exchange ideas and research results with PhD students from all over the world.  \r\nThis experience will help excite students about civil engineering and academia at this very \r\ncritical stage in their careers. \r\n",
