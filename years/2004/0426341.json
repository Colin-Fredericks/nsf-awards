 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nThe proposal seeks NSF support for twelve controls and signal processing researchers\r\nand teachers from the U.S.A. to attend a joint Balkan/USA/EC/Japan workshop on\r\nresearch and education in control and signal processing. Similar proposals have been\r\nsubmitted to the EC and Japan to support attendance by members of those communities.\r\nApproximately three-dozen attendees from the Balkans are expected.\r\nThe intellectual merit of having a delegation of twelve Americans participate in such a\r\nworkshop is in the opportunities to learn from the other participants and in the\r\nopportunities to teach them. There will be many attendees who are outstanding in their\r\nspecialties. Because of the recent troubles in the Balkans, many of their excellent\r\nresearchers have been isolated from the rest of the research community. This will be an\r\nopportunity for us to learn of their work and for them to catch up with what we have been\r\ndoing.\r\nThe broader impacts of such a joint workshop are large. First, the Balkan countries have\r\nbeen a source of many outstanding researchers in the past. The workshop will help bring\r\nyounger researchers and students from the Balkans into the broader international research\r\ncommunity. Second, the meeting itself will help foster further collaboration between the\r\nparticipants, their institutions, and their countries. Lastly, such meetings generally\r\ncontribute to broader understanding among people and nations.",
