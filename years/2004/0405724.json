 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Wayne will study the long-time behavior of partial\r\ndifferential equations like the Navier-Stokes, Euler, and Maxwell's\r\nequations which arise in the study of fluid dynamics and optics.  He\r\nwill use methods and techniques from dynamical systems theory to make\r\nqualitative and quantitative predictions about the behavior of the\r\nsolutions of these equations and  will focus on five main areas: (i)\r\nThe derivation, justification and experimental validation of model\r\nequations for waves on fluid surfaces; (ii) The long-time behavior of\r\nsolutions of the Navier-Stokes equations; particularly vortex\r\nsolutions; (iii) The modeling of very short pulses in optical media;\r\n(iv) The existence and stability of pulse solutions in coupled optical\r\nsystems; and (v) The approximation of the motion of thin elastic\r\nmedia. In particular, he will attempt to extend the insights gained\r\nfrom understanding the invariant geometrical objects in the phase\r\nspace of ordinary differential equations to the infinite dimensional\r\nsetting of partial differential equations, focusing particularly on\r\nthe case of problems on unbounded spatial domains where the presence\r\nof continuous spectrum may cause qualitative differences between the\r\nbehavior of the finite and infinite dimensional systems.\r\n\r\nThe types of systems that Professor Wayne will study arise in many\r\napplications, including nonlinear optical communication, fluid\r\nmechanics and the behavior of elastic materials.  For instance,\r\nattempts to obtain faster and faster transmission of information\r\nthrough optical fibers often utilize extremely short optical pulses.\r\nWhile there is a well understood and much studied method for\r\napproximating the transmission of long pulses through such fibers\r\noptical technology is now reaching the point where this approximation\r\nbreaks down and new models are needed.  Point (iii) in the list of\r\nprojects above aims to develop such approximations.  This problem,\r\nlike the others that will be studied in this project, is characterized\r\nby the fact that while it is impossible to solve the equations\r\ngoverning the system exactly, applications require at least a\r\nqualitative understanding of the behavior of solutions.  Professor\r\nWayne's research has three goals:  First, the derivation of model\r\nequations which can be used to approximate the behavior of the true\r\nphysical system -- whether it arises in optics, fluids, or elsewhere.\r\nSecondly, the computation of accurate estimates to control how much\r\nthe behavior of the true system can deviate from that of the model\r\nsystem, and finally the development of geometrical insights which can\r\nprovide a  qualitative means of understanding and predicting the\r\nbehavior of this type of complicated physical system even if the\r\nactual solution can not be computed.\r\n\r\n",
