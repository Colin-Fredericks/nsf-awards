 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Association of Engineering Societies (AAES), the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), and WGBH Educational Foundation will lead a coalition of the country engineering associations to develop and implement a national initiative to encourage girls to consider pursuing a degree and subsequent career in engineering. \r\nComprised of a national outreach campaign, television broadcast, multimedia resources, and companion Web site, the EXTRAORDINARY WOMEN ENGINEERS initiative will provide an accurate picture of engineering, but also present it as an attractive and compelling option for girls. The project activities include: conducting a needs assessment; hosting focus groups with high school girls, science, math, and technology teachers, guidance/career counselors, and engineers; establishing an advisory committee; researching compelling stories for the television broadcast and multimedia resources; developing the outreach and Web components; creating evaluation plans; and producing a report addressing the question of what motivates a high school girl to consider engineering. In this phase of the EXTRAORDINARY WOMEN ENGINEERS initiative, the coalition will research and test persuasive messages and effective delivery mechanisms aimed at getting high school girls to consider an engineering education and career.\r\n",
