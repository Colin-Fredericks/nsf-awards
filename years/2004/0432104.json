 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our eyes are never at rest.Even when e are .xating upon a visual target,small involuntary eye\r\nmovements continuously perturb the projection of the image on the retina.A substantial body of\r\nrecent evidence indicates that these .xational eye movements are an important component of the\r\nay visual information is acquired and represented in the brain.Neurophysiological studies with\r\nmonkeys have sho n that small eye movements strongly a .ect the responses of neurons in the visual\r\nsystem.In the research of a previous NSF award (EIA-0130851),e have shown that fixational\r\ninstability is crucial for identifying stimuli presented for the brief durations that occur during\r\nnatural viewing (Rucci and Desbordes,2003),and improves the efficiency of visual representations\r\nin models of the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex (Rucci and Casile,2003b,\r\n2004).Furthermore,reproduction of human eye movements in a robotic system has sho n that\r\n.xational instability may provide reliable information of distance (Santini and Rucci,2003).\r\nBuilding on our previous results and those of recent neurophysiological studies,this proposal\r\ncontinues part of the research of NSF a ard EIA-0130851.It describes a program of research that\r\nfocuses on extracting and integrating multiple depth cues to develop a reliable 3D representation\r\nof the visual scene.This project follows an interdisciplinary approach that integrates computer\r\nmodeling of the visual cortex with robotic experiments and measurements of eye movements in\r\nhuman subjects.The long-term goal of this research is to develop machine vision systems that,by\r\nemulating the computational principles of the brain,achieve high levels of robustness and e .ciency.\r\nThe specific aims of this project are to:\r\n1.Develop a model of the monkey primary visual cortex in which,following recent neurophysi-\r\nological .ndings,distinct populations of neurons respond during di .erent phases of small eye\r\nmovements.\r\n2.(a)Analyze the information of relative distance transmitted by di .erent neuronal populations\r\nwhen the model is coupled with a robotic oculomotor orkstation that replicates human eye\r\nmovements;and (b)integrate depth information provided by di .erent cues into a coherent\r\n3D representation of the visual scene.\r\n3.Investigate the self-organization of the model by means of learning,so that the extraction\r\nand integration of depth information is autonomously tuned to the physical and motor char-\r\nacteristics of the system.\r\nIn this research,the eye movements of human observers will be measured by a high-resolution\r\neye-tracker,and then accurately replicated by a robotic system (a head/eye system with t o mo-\r\nbile cameras)that e have speci .cally designed to reproduce the visual inputs to the eyes during\r\noculomotor behavior.Visual images acquired in this ay will be applied as input to computational\r\nmodels of neurons in the striate cortex of primates.Intellectual merit: This project establishes\r\na direct linkbet een human and machine vision studies.By focusing on the computational mecha-\r\nnisms by which eye movements a .ect visual processing,it has the potential of providing new insights\r\non the brain as ell as opening the ay to the development of new algorithms in machine vision.\r\nBroader impact: The interdisciplinary nature of this research o .ers new opportunities for train-\r\ning students.By collaborating with the PI,students in the Department of Cognitive and Neural\r\nSystems at Boston University,a department ith an important focus on computational modeling\r\nof the brain,will have an opportunity to combine their theoretical orkwith the development of\r\nmachine vision systems.",
