 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the purchase of a research grade thermogravimetric analysis system to facilitate undergraduate and MS level research and education.  The research program for which this equipment is needed is based upon reverse microemulsion polymerization technology for formulating advanced nanocomposite polymers exhibiting fire resistance, effects of non-halogenated flame retardants on polymer flame stability, synthesis and thermal stability of novel benzotriazole-based step-growth polymers, thermal stability and curing of advanced coatings, and thermal analysis of reverse microemulsions for controlled combustion effects.  This thermogravimetric analysis system is built around a research grade thermogravimetric analyzer and includes a quadrupole mass spectrometer and an evolved gas analyzer.  This system will facilitate mechanistic studies of several projects ongoing in two of our Colleges, and will provide a thermal analysis center in our Coatings Research Institute that will be available to and shared with other investigators campus wide and used in our advanced undergraduate and M.S. polymers and coatings laboratory educational program.  This initial work will contribute to the education and training of students in an institution heavily committed to the education and training of women and minorities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award supports the purchase of a research grade thermogravimetric analysis system to facilitate undergraduate and MS level research and education.  This system will allow us to study how various materials decompose as the materials are heated in air or in other gases.  The results of these studies will provide advanced materials that have improved fire resistance properties and fuels that burn more cleanly.  This new instrumentation system will help faculty and students in several projects ongoing in two of our Colleges and also in our Coatings Research Institute where we interface our research results with industry here in the southeastern Michigan area and nationwide.  Our initial work using this instrumentation will contribute to the education and training of students in an institution heavily committed to the education and training of women and minorities\r\n\r\n",
