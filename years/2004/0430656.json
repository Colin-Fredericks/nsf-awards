 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concrete Problems in Computational Complexity Theory\r\n\r\nNicholas Pippenger\r\nDepartment of Computer Science\r\nPrinceton University\r\n\r\nThe goal of computational complexity theory is to determine the \r\ncomputational resources needed to carry out various computational tasks.\r\nThe resources measured may involve hardware (such as gates used to \r\nconstruct a circuit, or area on a chip) or software (such as the time or \r\nspace used in the execution of a program on a machine), and the tasks \r\nconsidered may range from a simple addition of two integers to a large \r\nalgebraic or geometric computation.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will deal primarily with \"low level\" complexity \r\ntheory, in which the resources required grow modestly (at most quadratically) \r\nwith the size of the task. Examples of such tasks are furnished by the \r\narithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division\r\nand square-root extraction) performed by the execution of single \r\ninstructions in a computer. For these tasks, hardware-oriented resource \r\nmeasures are most appropriate in most cases.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will also explore problems involving fault-tolerant \r\ncomputing. There is a classical theory concerning transient errors in \r\ncircuits that delineates fairly clearly the theoretical possibilities and \r\nlimitations in this situation. The proposed research will deal with two \r\naspects of fault-tolerant computing about which much less is known:\r\npermanent errors occurring over time, and transient errors in quantum \r\ncommunication and computation. For these questions, hardware-oriented \r\nresource measures are again most appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed research lie in the promotion of \r\ninterdisciplinary links between theoretical computer science on one hand, \r\nand mathematics and physics on the other. It has of course always been the \r\ncase that computer scientists have drawn heavily on techniques and results \r\nfrom mathematics and physics, since mathematics and physics form the \r\nfoundations of computer science and engineering. What is proposed here, \r\nhowever, is to return the favor by applying methods developed within \r\ntheoretical computer science to problems of interest to mathematicians \r\nand physicists.\r\n",
