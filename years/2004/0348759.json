 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mimicking natural organisms to solve engineering design problems has triggered revolutionary developments in bio-medical and material sciences. In these instances the natural and the engineering design problems are most often closely related, and a direct transfer of design concepts was possible. However, to fully\r\nexploit natural design concepts and to apply biomimetic design approaches to a broad range of engineering design problems, a formal design framework based on abstraction and synthesis is needed to facilitate the fundamental understanding of biomimetic design.  \r\n\r\nThis career-development plan is motivated by the challenges of extending biomimetics into a formal design approach. The proposed work will provide a formal design framework, will allow the systematic study of a broad  range of natural systems, and will foster the rapid integration of biologically inspired solutions\r\ninto engineering design. The research projects will focus on the development and the application of unique optimization tools for the biomimetic design of adaptive, shape-controlled, macro and micro systems.\r\nControlling the shape is an essential capability of most adaptive systems, such as optical micro-electromechanical switches and next generation aircraft equipped with morphing wings.  Design oriented courses, enhanced by a new educational design optimization software platform, and vertically integrated design teams will promote the skills of future design engineers. Outreach activities will promote engineering design disciplines among K-12 students and underrepresented groups. The research and\r\neducational activities will be enhanced by comprehensive collaborations with physiologists, design groups at national laboratories, and software companies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
