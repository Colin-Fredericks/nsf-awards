 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Memphis is hosting a workshop with two major objectives related to the EarthScope initiative. The primary objective of the workshop is to develop testable scientific hypotheses to advance our understanding of lithospheric composition and properties, and the evolution of the North American continent, far from current plate boundaries. In addition to defining hypotheses, the workshop will discuss designing experiments to efficiently test as many hypotheses as possible, focusing on use of USArray. The second objective is to formulate plans for using EarthScope facilities as a framework to advance hazard assessment experiments. In addition to providing needed products for the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program and other geologic hazards efforts, this objective recognizes and seeks to exploit significant opportunities for outreach and logistical support for the deployment of USArray's transportable array. The workshop is collaborative and coordinated with the US Geological Survey and the Mid-America Earthquake Center. The workshop also seeks to identify sources of existing geological and geophysical data and to outline a strategy for incorporating them into a synoptic database needed for planning EarthScope deployments and complementing EarthScope data products. The workshop deliberations are to be made widely available in a variety of formats. The workshop provides an unusual opportunity for the lay public and for educators to observe the creative process of scientific inquiry. Those scientists who cannot attend the workshop will be able to read brief summaries of the proceedings in articles in widely read professional news publications (e.g., EOS, Geotimes). These brief articles will serve to advertise a web-site containing more full recounting of the workshop. The target date for the workshop itself is 25-27 August 2004.
