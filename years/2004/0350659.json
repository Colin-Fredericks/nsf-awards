 "awd_abstract_narration": "Funding from NSF will support a special occasion conference, \"Factor Analysis at 100: Historical Developments and Future Directions.\" The conference marks the 100th anniversary of the publication of Charles Spearman's seminal and monumental article, \"General Intelligence, Objectively Determined and Measured,\" in the American Journal of Psychology, which outlined the framework of a new statistical tool in support of his psychological theory about intelligence.  The statistical method was factor analysis.  In the 99 years since it was introduced, factor analysis has become as integral to the development of psychological science as any method or procedure used in the study of human behavior.  Vigorous methodological research and development continues today on factor analysis and its various extensions and generalizations, and these methods serve a critical role in substantive research in many areas of psychology as well as other sciences.  The overarching objective of the conference is to examine the history, current state and significant issues, and future directions of the theory, methodology and application of factor analysis.  Through this examination, we hope to clarify the state of the art and future directions of research, and to facilitate and enhance the quality of continued research with respect to both methodology and application.  These objectives will be achieved by gathering together the most prominent researchers in the field along with an audience of scientists and students with a special interest in learning more about the field and carrying on the development and proper use of factor analysis and related methods.  The bulk of the funding provided by NSF will be used to promote and support attendance and participation at the conference by graduate students, university faculty, and researchers with an interest in the theory and application of factor analysis.",
