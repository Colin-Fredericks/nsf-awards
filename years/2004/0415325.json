 "awd_abstract_narration": "Interest in solid state chemistry has undergone explosive growth in recent years due to the broadly based recognition of the scientific challenges and technological importance attached to the discovery and study of new materials.  Many scientists from other disciplines see opportunities for performing exciting research in this area.  The 2004 Solid State Chemistry Gordon Research Conference will be held at Colby-Sawyer State College, New London, NH from July 25-30, 2004.  The goal of the conference is to facilitate international collaborations and information exchange across a broad spectrum of researchers with interests in solid-state chemistry.  The NSF funds will be used to help support the attendance of young American Scientists as well as several senior U.S. session chairs and invited speakers.  Partial NSF support will also make possible the participation of approximately 20 graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty from undergraduate institutions.\r\n\r\n%%%\r\n\r\nThe Solid State Chemistry community continues to have direct impact on technological advances of high significance to society by designing new materials such as new superconductors, catalysts, and magnetic and electronic materials.\r\n",
