Moore\r\n\r\nThe proposed research concerns applying new techniques in set\r\ntheory and infinite combinatorics to basis problems in topology,\r\ngraph theory, and order theory.  In each case, the goal is to\r\nprove a classification theorem for the uncountable objects in a\r\ncertain category.  Three such categories are topological spaces,\r\nbipartite graphs, and linear orders.  The goal is to use forcing\r\naxioms to prove that the category has a finite basis of classical\r\nexamples. The techniques employed in analyzing such problems are\r\noften Ramsey theoretic and frequently draw upon results and\r\nmotivation which arise in analyzing Cantor's continuum problem\r\nand Suslin's classification problem for the real line.  The\r\nproposed research seeks to expand our understanding of forcing\r\naxioms and their impact upon basis problems and the continuum\r\nproblem.  The PI has already proved that the Proper Forcing Axiom\r\nimplies that the uncountable linear orders have a five element\r\nbasis, answering one of the central problems of the proposal.\r\nThe proof involved new techniques in infinite combinatorics which\r\nare likely relevant to completing the rest of the proposal.  At\r\nthe crux is the PI's notion of set mapping reflection which was\r\nformulated in relation to his results on the Proper Forcing Axiom\r\nand the size of the continuum.  Conspicuous in the solution is\r\nthe need for a strong axiom of infinity to obtain the consistency\r\nof a five element basis.  This was quite unexpected and may serve\r\nboth to explain past difficulties and fuel future research on the\r\nrelationship between very large sets and combinatorics associated\r\nwith the smallest uncountable cardinal.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research represents an analysis of fundamental\r\nmathematical objects - graphs, orders, and topologies - using a\r\ngeneralized version of the probabilistic method which Paul Erdos\r\npioneered in his study of networks, packings, prime numbers, and\r\ncircuit complexity.  The apothegm of the probabilistic method is:\r\n\"If an object occurs with positive probability, it exists.\"  For\r\nfinite probability spaces, this is a fact.  For infinite spaces\r\nand their generalizations - known as forcing notions - it\r\nrequires additional axiomatic assumptions - known as forcing\r\naxioms.  The PI has recently shown, for instance, under such\r\nassumptions that any linear order which cannot be represented as\r\na collection of rational numbers must contain one of five\r\ncritical orders.  While at the present this would seem to\r\nrepresent a theoretical accomplishment with little practical\r\nsignificance, the style of argument may inspire real world\r\napplications in the future.  A recent example of such a success\r\nin set theory is Laver's algorithm for comparing braids.  An\r\nimportant question which arises in a number of areas of\r\nmathematics and science - from particle physics to genetics - is\r\nwhen two braids can be made to look the same without cutting or\r\nbreaking the strands.  Laver used ideas from the theory of large\r\ninfinite sets to devise a fast algorithm for comparing braids.\r\nThe previous algorithm was exponentially slow.  Current\r\nalgorithms based on Laver's idea run in quadratic time (fast).\r\nHence the study of infinite sets can provide practical\r\napplications to much more down to earth objects.  The proposed\r\nresearch may some day have applications in the traditional\r\nfinitary probabilistic method or less foreseeable impact as with\r\nwith Laver's work.\r\n",
