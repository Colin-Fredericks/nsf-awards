 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Workshop will be held at NSF January 22-23, 2004 on Ceramics Materials needed in Data Storage Technology.The Workshop forum will provide for interaction between academia, industry, and national labs in this topical area and seeks to develop a framework and environment under which mutually beneficial collaborative endeavors can be seeded. The focus will be on identifying key areas of research within the broad field of ceramic materials, in which significant progress can be accomplished through a carefully considered collaborative program involving the three constituencies. Sessions including Magnetic storage, Surface engineering and Advanced processing, Thin film ferroelectric memories, and Microscopy, scanned probes & spectroscopy will run over two full days. Issues related to enhancing diversity and education and training of scientists and engineers will also be addressed. A workshop report will include the following: Overview of meeting-major highlights, ideas of interest; Assessment of critical issues in the field, important areas to focus on the near and far future; Recommendations on each of the sub-topics; A one-page abstract from each person in attendance in an identical format.\r\n%%%\r\nDiscussions at the proposed workshop will include a critical evaluation of the field and promote collaborations among academia, industry and government labs. The combined input from industry, government, and universities will allow a broad base of the research community to promote research programs of mutual benefit that satisfy unmet needs and to develop education and training approaches for future scientists and engineers in this field.\r\n***\r\n",
