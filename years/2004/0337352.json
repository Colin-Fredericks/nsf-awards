 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to do an isotopic and trace element study of samples from the Waianae Volcano in Hawaii.  This study will take advantage of the deep exposure, and previously determined detailed knowledge of internal stratigraphy, and variations in magma supply and melting processes at different stages of volcanic evolution that should be correlated to changing distance from the Hawaiian plume center. This work will produce a high-quality, comprehensive data set that will provide insight into the nature of compositional components expressed when the volcano was above different portions of the plume, how these components contribute to Hawaiian magmas at variable extents of partial melting, and how variations in magma composition, partial melting and overall magma supply affected the development and evolution of magma reservoirs within the volcanic edifice. \r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impacts, the project will contribute to the training of an undergraduate student in the acquisition and interpretation of isotopic and high-precision trace element data, and development of the early career of female post-doc Iris Van der Zander. Results of this work will be published in easily accessible journals, incorporated into classroom teaching and community lectures by the P.I.s, as well as into a popular Web site, and thus disseminated to a wide audience, including non-science majors.\r\n",
