The motivation for this training effort comes from (i) the proliferation of high quality oceanographic data streams, (ii)recent developments in mathematical and computational physics, (iii) the unfortunate decline of the graduate student population in physical oceanography, and (iv) recent experience of the PIs with a comparable summer school held in Europe. The goals of the summer school are to (i) promote challenging and interesting oceanographic problems both within the subdiscipline of physical oceanography and the related non-oceanographic fields of applied mathematics, engineering and physics, (ii) introduce a select body of national and international students to the quantitative analysis of front rank problems in physical oceanography, and (iii) promote interactions between the summer school faculty and the student body.\r\nIt is anticipated that the school will recruit talented physically and mathematically oriented graduate students from a variety of fields to address oceanographically significant problems, advance the use of novel and advanced mathematical methods in physical oceanography and  identify promising new problems and paradigms within physical oceanography for cutting edge mathematical investigation.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe summer school will facilitate the development, application and distribution of advanced mathematical techniques within the oceanographic community, as well as expose the unique flavor and complexity of oceanographic problems to mathematically minded allied disciplines.\r\n\r\n",
