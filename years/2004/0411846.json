 "awd_abstract_narration": "his project continues work to build a multi-user virtual environment,\r\nknown as Quest Atlantis, that is academically valuable, game like, and\r\nthat engages elementary students in socially-responsive practices. This\r\ngrant will undertake a series of naturalistic studies and experimental\r\nmanipulations that will advance theoretical and practical knowledge with\r\nrespect to the design of multi-user virtual environments for supporting\r\nscience learning. Specifically, the project will test three hypotheses:\r\nFirst, that students learning academic content within a\r\nsocially-responsive gaming context will learn more and be more engaged\r\nthan those learning through teaching methods that do not explicitly have\r\na gaming component. This portion of the study will also examine if the\r\ngaming context works will work equally well if the academic tasks vary\r\nin difficulty or if there is some necessary balance between the amount\r\nof learning and playing.  Second, participants, especially girls, will\r\nachieve and learn more and be more engaged when their participation is\r\nsituated in a gender-balanced, socially-responsive gaming context as\r\nopposed to a male-dominated one, or simply a gaming context without an\r\nexplicit social agenda.   Third, students participating in a gaming\r\nenvironment will achieve, learn and be more engaged if the environment\r\nleverages a community-based element than if it just supports single-user\r\nparticipation.   The project will also produce qualitative accounts of\r\nparticipation in all conditions, but especially the socially-responsive\r\ngaming condition so as to understand how children from different\r\nsocio-economic groups and of different genders come to participate in\r\nand make sense of the collective experience of the meta-game context.  \r\n\r\n",
