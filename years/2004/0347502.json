 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microwave ground penetrating radar can detect landmines, locate underground\r\npipes and identify subsurface defects in runways. Millimeter-waves can\r\npenetrate through non-conductive walls and clothing, and many packaging.\r\nRemote sensing systems based on millimeter waves allow detection of\r\ncontraband, plastic explosives, and ceramic weapons, while providing good\r\nimage identification and resolution. Because microwaves and mm-waves can\r\nalso better penetrate through dust, fog, and smoke, they are useful in\r\nbattlefield scenarios, terrorist attack responses, and fire rescue\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nIn this project, we will study and develop new time-domain inversion\r\ntechniques that exploit fundamental aspects of ultra-wideband (UWB)\r\nscattering and propagation in random (disordered) media. UWB remote sensing\r\nsystems are attractive because they take advantage of operation at both\r\nlower (more penetration into lossy materials) and higher frequencies (larger\r\nresolution), and are more immune to both atmospheric and multipath\r\ninterference effects. The new imaging and detection techniques will utilize\r\ntime-reversal synthetic back-propagation to achieve super-resolution,\r\ntime-domain statistical stability, and selective focusing of UWB signals in\r\ndisordered media. We will also develop new time-domain forward solvers for\r\nUWB wave propagation in random media. The resulting forward solvers will\r\nallow the simulation of virtual scenes of increasingly realistic remote\r\nsensing scenarios and with increased geometric fidelity and numerical\r\naccuracy, thus allowing for better synthetic discrimination of UWB weak\r\nscattering mechanisms and improved overall efficiency of inverse scattering\r\nalgorithms.\r\n\r\nThe above research objectives are integrated with an educational component\r\naimed at developing a strong interdisciplinary program for engineering\r\nstudents. At the undergraduate level, it will involve the curricular\r\nrevision and improvement of undergraduate courses, and the introduction of\r\nundergraduate early research experiences aligned with the above research\r\nobjectives. At the graduate level, this project will develop two new\r\ngraduate courses, and will involve graduate students on all aspects of this\r\nproject.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
