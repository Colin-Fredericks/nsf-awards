 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brooklyn Botanic Garden \r\nAbstract for National Science Foundation Proposal, #0346619\r\nJanuary 22, 2004\r\n\r\nA grant has been awarded to Brooklyn Botanic Garden under the direction of Dr. K. Barringer for 'AILANTHUS Grows in Brooklyn: Curation, Data Capture, and Presentation of Historical Specimens from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.' The goal of this project is to make data on 90,000 contemporary and historical herbarium specimens from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut available on the Internet. The project is part of a long-term effort to catalog the complete holdings of the Garden's Herbarium.  The Herbarium contains a valuable collection of 290,000 contemporary and historical plant specimens used by researchers from around the world to study plants and their distribution. The majority of contemporary specimens have been collected through the Garden's New York Metropolitan Flora project, an active 20-year study of the flora of the tri-state area. Among the historical specimens from the region are collections found nowhere else, such as the George Scarborough collection from southern New Jersey, the George Hulst collection (1860's), the Henry Dautun collection (1890's), and others from Lake George and Long Island. This project will enable researchers to compare these contemporary and historical records in new ways - from analyzing changes in the distribution of plant species over time, to exploring the decline of native species, and the spread of invasive species - helping to build a more accurate model of the contemporary environment.   \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the project will add data on 60,000 historical specimens to the Herbarium database, AILANTHUS, and make the data universally accessible via the Garden's Web site, http://www.bbg.org.  The result will be increased awareness of Brooklyn Botanic Garden's Herbarium collection, providing access to a unique dataset that was previously unavailable, and enabling researchers to easily use data from the collection in their work.  \r\n\r\nBy making previously unavailable botanical information accessible on the Internet, the project has significance for a broad spectrum of individuals - from scientists and environmental professionals, to teachers, students and amateur naturalists. The data will be used by researchers and students studying environmental change and vegetation history, as well as State and Federal botanists tracking rare plants and invasive species. The project will make data available on critical habitats, like the New York - New Jersey Highlands, wetlands, and the Pine Barrens, and will provide data on the effects of habitat loss and urban sprawl. Also, the data will be used to help develop appropriate land use regulations, improve understanding of native biodiversity,  limit the impact of invasive plants, and protect rare and endangered species. The project will also be used to enhance the Garden's science education initiatives that include the first environmental high school in Brooklyn, the Brooklyn Academy of Science and the Environment, as well as on-site internship programs. \r\n\r\n",
