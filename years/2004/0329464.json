 "awd_abstract_narration": "0329464  Nyman  The Phase I research proved the feasibility of a novel hybrid approach for remediating contaminated sediments: peroxy-acid pretreatment combined with microbial degradation of selected contaminants (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), trinitrotoluene (TNT), aromatic amines and other challenging hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs)). The unique advanced-oxidation process (AOP) took advantage of the synergistic effect of enhanced pollutant desorption and solubility and parallel compound transformation that ultimately led to efficient biodegradation. The present Phase II proposal targets the complete elucidation of the rates and mechanisms of the transformation of HOCs and understanding the engineering parameters that control and limit the efficiency of the hybrid treatment. Therefore, several HOCs will be examined in both synthetic and real sediment matrices under varying experimental conditions. Isotope ratio mass spectroscopy, in combination with other chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques, will be used to identify productprecursor relationships during various process stages, estimate reaction pathways and kinetic parameters, and identify potential reaction scavengers. The research will test the efficacy of the optimized process using sediment cores obtained from a Superfund site in bench-scale experiments.  We have assembled a truly interdisciplinary team with a unique combination of expertise, experience and analytical/experimental capability that are required to successfully complete our research goals. The same team, along with their students and associates, previously met and exceeded the milestones set for our Phase I research.\r\nBroader Impact:\r\nWe are addressing the enormous societal challenge of remediating contaminated sediment and soil with a novel hybrid technology. Unlike other AOPs, the peroxy-acid process is simple, low energy, practical and requires easily implemented reactor designs. In addition, to the efficacy of the process shown in our Phase I study, increases in compound solubility and thus bioavailability may further stimulate natural attenuation. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could easily employ this technology to remediate sediment (or soil) in a confined disposal facility (CDF). Several companies, named as potentially responsible parties (PRPs) in Superfund sites (such as General Electric Company), could use this method to clean PCB contaminated dredged sediment, excavated soils or specific industrial wastes. It is also important to realize that sediments, such as the New York Harbor ones, must be dredged to maintain shipping lanes, and, therefore, we need better remediation alternatives to process the dredged sediment. The PIs have demonstrated strong track records in training undergraduate and graduate students from several different disciplines (e.g., engineering disciplines and science).  Similarly, the PIs have demonstrated track records of exposing and encouraging high school students (especially women and minority students) to activities and careers in environmental science and engineering. Additionally, we believe that mentoring high school minority students is needed to improve the enrollment of traditionally underrepresented groups in engineering fields.  As with the Phase I research, the Phase II research will be the nexus of student training and research in environmental science and engineering at RPI.\r\n",
