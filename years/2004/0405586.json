 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main focus of this proposal is the conjugacy problem in braid groups,\r\nand ultimately in Garside and Artin groups and also in surface mapping\r\nclass groups.   To begin, we propose to investigate the interface between\r\ntwo known approaches to the conjugacy problem in the braid groups: (a) the\r\ncombinatorial solution that originated with the work of Frank Garside in\r\n1968; and (b) the dynamic approach which was first studied by Jakob\r\nNielsen in 1932 and later given new meaning, in 1982, by William Thurston.\r\nWe note that (a) gives a definitive test for when two braids are\r\nconjugate, whereas (b) gives less than that. On the other hand (a) is\r\nexponential in both word length and braid index, whereas (b) suggests the\r\npossible existence of a polynomial solution.  The moment seems to be ripe\r\nfor an investigation which combines aspects of both. The new work of\r\nGebhardt on (a) shows that the `Super Summit Set', a complete class\r\ninvariant, can be replaced by the smaller `Ultra Summit Set'  (USS). Our\r\nhope is to use the known dynamic classification to study the USS. We will\r\nbegin with a study of reducing curves for reducible braids, and go on to\r\nstudy finite order (FO) and pseudo-Anosov (PA) braids.   We conjecture\r\nthat for braids in the USS the reducing curves can be chosen to be round\r\ncircles which meet a line containing the punctures in 2 points.  We\r\nconjecture further that PA braids have `rigid powers whose combinatorics\r\nis particularly simple.  Looking at the braid group as a special case of\r\nmapping class groups, one then expects further that the associated train\r\ntracks will be special and interesting.  If all this goes well, there will\r\nbe further problems to investigate, including related combinatorics in\r\nmore general mapping class groups, and related dynamics in more general\r\nGarside and Artin groups.\r\n\r\nIn recent years there has been great interest in certain codes, in `Public\r\nKey Cryptography, which are based upon the use of braid groups.  The\r\nunderlying idea has been that the so-called `word problem in the braid\r\ngroups is known to have a solution which is fast. That is, the time\r\nrequired to check whether two words represent the same element in the\r\nbraid group is known to be polynomial as a function of word length L and\r\nbraid index N. On the other hand, the conjugacy problem, which is more\r\ndifficult, has been thought to be fundamentally exponential in L and N.\r\nLike most such problems in complexity theory (e.g. the factorization of\r\nnumbers into primes) the possibility always exists that a particular\r\nproblem which was thought to be exponential will turn out to be polynomial\r\nif a more ingenious solution can be found.  The PI has been a leading\r\nexpert in the study of braid groups for many years. She now proposes to\r\ninvestigate the conjugacy problem in the braid groups from a new point of\r\nview which she hopes will show it to be polynomial, like the word problem,\r\nin both L and N.  The underlying idea is to look at two very different\r\napproaches to the conjugacy problem, one based on `combinatorics and the\r\nother on `dynamics, and to apply ideas from the second approach to\r\nsimplify the first.  If successful, this research would have implications\r\nin Public Key Cryptography as regards the security of codes based upon\r\nbraid groups. It should also have many applications in mathematics because\r\nof the central role played by the braid groups.\r\n\r\n",
