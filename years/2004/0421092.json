 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal, supporting emerging directions in mixed-signal electronic systems and in (re-)configurable computing, aims at acquiring a collection of hardware equipment to enable hardware-related research in several areas including analog and mixed signal design, CAD for reconfigurable computing projects, and several reconfigurable computing system projects. This research and training facility centers on electronic simulation, rapid prototyping, and testing. Projects specifically address, among others, distributed simulation, MEMS built-in self-test, FPGA CAD environments, reconfigurable computing analysis and adaptation, power-aware FPGA design mapping. The major pieces of the infrastructure include a printed circuit board station, electronic test instruments, reconfigurable computing boards, and optical test equipment. The facility enables realistic hardware experimentation, analysis, and demonstration of the research ideas previously verified largely by simulations in mixed-signal electronic systems and in configurable computing.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:  Impacts future research directions, graduate students and collaborators; impacts courses, and further extends educational opportunities to minority students. 20 universities will share the equipment. The project also encourages more industrial collaboration.\r\n",
