 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proper characterization of elastic anisotropy can help understand the \r\ncauses, mechanisms, and consequences of tectonic deformation in the \r\nupper mantle and in other regions of the Earth's deep interior and \r\nbeneath regions of active tectonics.  Unfortunately, our \r\nunderstanding of seismic anisotropy is still unsatisfactory and \r\ninterpretation of seismological diagnostics of anisotropy (such as \r\nshear wave birefringence) is often ambiguous.   Gaining full \r\nunderstanding of seismic anisotropy and flow beneath complex tectonic \r\nregions has, therefore, remained an outstanding challenge of modern \r\nseismology and geodynamics.  In collaboration with colleagues in \r\nFrance, scientists from MIT and Colorado School of Mines propose to \r\nmeet this challenge through the explicit integration of powerful data \r\nsets and forward and inverse modeling tools.  In particular, they aim \r\nto improve the understanding of 3-D seismic anisotropy and tectonic \r\ndeformation in the upper mantle near subduction zones, which are \r\ntectonic regions that are of particular societal interest because of \r\ntheir association with significant volcanic and seismic hazard.  They \r\nwill focus on Japan, where geophysical instrumentation is dense \r\nbecause of the need for the continuous monitoring of seismic and \r\nvolcanic activity.\r\n\r\nData from these dense networks can be obtained through the internet, \r\nthanks to scientists in Japan, and the MIT-CSM team has already \r\nassembled a large data set from 64 broadband seismic stations. \r\nThrough examination of ~12,000 individual seismograms, they compiled \r\na database of ~1330 high-quality shear wave splitting measurements \r\nfor S, SKS/SKKS, and ScS, and more will be added later.  They propose \r\nto improve the quantitative interpretation of the splitting maps by \r\ncombining two complementary approaches.  First, they wish to extend \r\ntheir numerical modeling of upper mantle flow from 2.5 to 3-D, \r\nincorporating (evolving) velocity boundary conditions and realistic \r\ngeometries and rheologies. Second, they plan to develop a novel \r\ntechnique for tomographic inversion of the observed shear wave \r\npolarizations and split times.  The flow models will be used to \r\ndesign the parameterization and regularization of the inversion, and, \r\nin turn, the seismic imaging results will be used to update the flow \r\nmodels.  Such an explicitly cross-disciplinary approach will not only \r\nyield new insight into the 3-D anisotropy and flow field beneath \r\nJapan.  Indeed, the powerful new tools and concepts for data \r\nanalysis, modeling, and interpretation can also be applied to data \r\nfrom such new initiatives as USArray/Earthscope.",
