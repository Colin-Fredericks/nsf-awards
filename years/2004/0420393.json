 "awd_abstract_narration": "0420393\r\nThomas\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation award to University of Maine (UM) provides funds for acquisition of an X-band ground station for the real-time reception of the latest generation of earth observation satellite data.  The data provide multi-spectral visible and infrared measurements of the ocean, coastal zones, forests and atmosphere.  In collaboration with Rutgers University, which operates a similar system, the University of Maine group plans to offer 24/7 satellite-derived products for northeast U.S. ocean observation, merging research and operational requirements.  The X-band capability significantly improves both resolution and information over an existing L-band facility at UM, and builds on the technical and educational expertise it has generated, including a major cross-departmental research and teaching program.  The broader impacts of the acquisition are extensive, involving both basic and applied research programs by state agencies, non-profit organizations and universities in Maine and nearby states, in addition to NSF.  Examples include studies of harmful algal blooms and storm impacts in the coastal environment, and forest vegetation and agricultural development on land.  The real-time capability provides important support to shipboard sampling programs with real-time images of surface ocean properties.  University of Maine is providing 30% of the costs of the project from non-federal funds.  This proposal is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.\r\n ***\r\n",
