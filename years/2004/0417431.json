 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some carbonate strata contain vugs or cavities about the size of a few\r\ncentimeters.  This project unites the expertise of geologists, geo-engineers,\r\nand mathematicians to study experimentally and computationally the flow and\r\ntransport of solutes in vuggy rocks over distances of 0.1 to 100 meters.\r\nExperimental studies of the Pipe Creek Reef outcrop in Central Texas will be\r\nmade: (1) in the laboratory on samples at the sub 10-20 cm scale to determine\r\nrock and vug properties and micro-scale tracer transport characteristics; (2)\r\nin the field over 1-10 m scales to determine effective permeabilities and\r\ntracer injection response; and (3) in the field using ground penetrating radar\r\nto map the large scale geology over 1-100 m scales.  The data will be used to\r\nconstruct a micro-scale model of the transport process at the detailed sub-cm\r\nscale and a macro-scale model to represent the system, including its\r\ntopological vug interconnectivity, time-scales, and macro-dispersion on scales\r\nof at least 1-100 m.  Efficient and accurate computational implementation will\r\nallow testing and verification.  Statistical analysis will quantify uncertainty\r\nin the data for use at full field scales.  The project is expected to result in\r\nsubstantially improved modeling of flow and transport in vuggy media over the\r\nmacro-scale, with a solid empirical basis for the selection of the effective\r\nparameters in the macro-scale model, and the handling of parameter uncertainty.\r\nIt should illuminate modeling of similar porous media, such as karsts and\r\nfractured systems, and, more generally, related multi-scale systems.  The\r\nproject will impact three Ph.D. students and enhance two outreaches to the\r\nindustrial community, the the Reservoir Characterization Research Laboratory\r\n(RCRL) and the Center for Subsurface Modeling (CSM).  Finally, since carbonate\r\nrocks comprise many of the world's aquifers and oil reservoirs, society will\r\nbenefit as progress allows more effective protection of groundwater supplies\r\nand production of petroleum.\r\n\r\nSome carbonate rock strata contain cavities, called vugs, about the size of a\r\nfew centimeters.  Fluid can flow much more easily in these vugs than within the\r\nrock itself (i.e., between the rock grains).  The transport of chemical\r\nspecies, such as groundwater contaminants, is strongly influenced by the nature\r\nof these vugs.  Within an inter-connected vug path, the contaminant can flow\r\nquite rapidly, but it must slow considerably when it re-enters the rock.\r\nHowever, little is currently known about how fluid flows in such vuggy rocks\r\nover long distances.  This project unites the expertise of geologists,\r\ngeo-engineers, and mathematicians to address the problem.  Experimental studies\r\nwill be made to determine the behavior of fluid flow in small vugs over 10-20\r\ncentimeters, and within vug channels up to 10 meters long.  Ground penetrating\r\nradar will be used to map the large scale geology over 1-100 meter scales.\r\nUsing this data, two models, or computer simulation codes, will be constructed.\r\nThe first model will describe the flow at the detailed sub-cm scale.  The\r\nsecond will describe the flow only in an average sense, so that it can be used\r\nmeaningfully at the field scale of an entire aquifer or petroleum reservoir.\r\nMoreover, statistical analysis will allow for the quantification of uncertainty\r\nin the data.  The project is expected to result in substantially improved\r\nmodeling of flow and transport in vuggy media over large scales.  The project\r\nwill impact the education of three Ph.D. students, who will be trained in an\r\ninterdisciplinary environment.  Since carbonate rocks comprise many of the\r\nworld's aquifers and oil reservoirs, society will benefit indirectly.\r\nSubsurface simulation is an important engineering tool.  Groundwater\r\ncontamination can be remediated or prevented through the engineering design of\r\nvalid, predictable, and cost effective remediation or containment strategies.\r\nEngineering analysis based on simulation studies is also used to quantify,\r\nmanage, and reduce risks related to oil reservoir management.",
