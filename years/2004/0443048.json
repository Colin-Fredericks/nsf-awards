 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal pursues a series of developments of new test statistics\r\nfor tail independence and of new measures for tail dependence.\r\nParticularly, the investigator studies extreme correlation\r\ncoefficient, tail dependence measures, gamma test statistics. These\r\nare related to the study of statistics of multivariate extremes. In\r\nfinancial applications, the proposal will also specify new models\r\nfor asset pricing and extreme co-movements for market data, and\r\ndevelop new portfolio evaluation tools more sensitive to these\r\nco-movements. A new measure for extreme co-movement is introduced.\r\nThe proposal includes the development of statistical estimation\r\nmethods for max-stable processes. Procedures of how to calculate\r\nportfolio risk measures are also introduced using combined Markov\r\nprocess and max-stable process models.\r\n\r\nAs all definitions used for extremal dependence depend on some limit\r\nprocedures and often concern statistical testing for parameters at\r\nthe edge of a specific parametric space, great care has to be taken\r\nto obtain tests with sufficient power. The proposal is exactly\r\naiming at finding a solution for this. The investigator will\r\ncarefully compare and contrast new approaches with existing ones\r\nusing simulated as well as real data. The real data will come from\r\nareas as diverse as insurance, finance, telecommunications,\r\nclimatology, seismology, medicine, etc. Throughout applications in\r\ndiverse fields (like above), extreme risks play an important\r\nscientific, societal as well as (possibly) political role. The\r\ndissemination of new statistical tools leading to a better\r\nunderstanding of the occurrence of joint extremes is of great\r\nimportance. This can be very well achieved at the level of new\r\ngraduate courses, publications in journals aimed at a broaden\r\naudience and in discussion with scientists from other fields.\r\n",
