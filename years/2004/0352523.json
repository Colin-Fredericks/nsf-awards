Professor Bor-Luh Lin, University of Iowa and three Indian mathematicians, P. Bandyopadhyay and T.S.S.R.K. Rao, Indian Statistical Institute and V. Indumathi, University of Pondicherry will study the geometry of Banach spaces.  In earlier work, they solved completely the isomorphic properties of nested sequences of balls in Banach spaces.  They propose to extend this solution to the isometric properties.  Additionally, they will study generalizations of various ball separation properties and the continuity of metric projections onto proximinal subspaces.  \r\n\r\nScope: Geometry of Banach spaces is currently a very active branch of research in Functional Analysis with wide-ranging applications in pure and applied mathematics.  Convex analysis is a major tool in many branches of mathematics including probability theory, wavelet theory, partical differential equations and computing theory with major applications to mathematical finances, economics, management sciences, and to basic sciences.  The US PI is an established researcher and the Indian group has a strong reputation.  It is a valuable collaboration that will promote interactions with excellent Indian instituions and will provide opportunities for graduate students, junior colleagues, and minorities.  The Government of India's Department of Science and Technology (DST) funds this research under the NSF/DST joint program.      \r\n\r\n",
