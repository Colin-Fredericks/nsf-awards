 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Pennsylvania's Nano Science and Engineering Center on Molecular Function at the Nano/Bio Interface will exploit Penn's strengths in design of molecular functionality, quantifying behavior of individual molecules, and interactions at organic/inorganic interfaces to perform research that establishes the foundation for understanding molecular function in the context of interfacing with physical systems. The NSEC unites 18 investigators from three schools (the School of Engineering and Applied Science, the School of Medicine, and the School of Arts and Sciences). Two multidisciplinary research teams are focused on aspects of the fundamental issues outlined above. Additionally, two cross cutting initiatives develop ideas integral to the research themes and make explicit links between them. The two fundamental themes are: optoelectronic function in synthetic biomolecules and mechanical motion of molecules from physiological systems. The two cross-cutting initiatives are on Molecular Nano Property Probes and Ethics in Nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThe impact of these efforts will be felt in biophysics, bioengineering, chemistry, electrical and mechanical engineering and materials science. Discoveries from this effort will provide a sound basis for the development of new technologies for nanoscale device manufacture, drug delivery and integrated chemical sensors, enabling several near term practical applications as well provide the basis for future practical implementation. Furthermore, these issues are also at the core of understanding many complex biological/physiological processes.\r\n \r\nThe broad impact of the NSEC will occur on several levels. From a technical perspective it will articulate the critical issues that define the field at the interface of nanotechnology and biology at the molecular level. As such it will focus the attention of many disciplines to an area that is at the core of future of the field. The NSEC will impact public education, social discourse, workforce development and diversity, both locally and nationally. The implementation of educational activities in an urban environment will target a highly diverse audience at the early stage when exposure to exciting science can influence interests and future career choices, while developing models that can be implemented across the country. This NSEC will take a leadership position in the social discussion of ethics in nanoscience and technology. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
