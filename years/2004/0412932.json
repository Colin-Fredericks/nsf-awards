Students working with Leslie Newman and accompanying her on \r\nsampling trips, will gauge patterns of distribution of flatworms, \r\nreceive training in underwater photography, and gather specimens for \r\nmicroscopical and molecular studies. She will also train students in \r\ncuratorial techniques. Working in the laboratory of Marianne Litvaitis \r\nat the University of New Hampshire, the students will concentrate on \r\nhistology, systematics, DNA techniques, graphics, and database \r\nconstruction. Commonly, positive species identification requires \r\nsectioning the animals. DNA sequences will be used as molecular \r\nbarcodes for each species and to address questions of within-group \r\nrelationships. Detailed taxonomic information, tissue vouchers, DNA \r\nsequences, and images of whole, live animals and of histological \r\nsections will be collected for each species and included in a \r\nweb-based, searchable database. Additional products of the proposed \r\nstudy include CD-ROM and hard copy versions of an identification guide \r\nthat will be available in English and Spanish, and a separate marine \r\nflatworms web page specifically designed for K-12 students.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance of the project includes an extensive training \r\ncomponent ranging from the undergraduate to the graduate level. Two \r\nminority graduate students have been recruited. Additional outreach and \r\neducational components include guest lectures, hands-on demonstrations, \r\nand marine field trips to stimulate interest in K-12 students for \r\nmarine invertebrates in general. Although many of these flatworms are \r\nprominent members of coral reefs, little is known about their \r\nbiodiversity. This is surprising considering that some of these worms \r\nhave been shown to prey on commercially important bivalve species and \r\nthus, impact the aquaculture industry. Other species in this group have \r\nproven to be toxic to fish. Finally, preliminary studies have shown \r\nthat some of these flatworms contain biopharmaceuticals and may be used \r\nas a vehicle to accumulate anticancer agents. Therefore, a thorough \r\nunderstanding of their biodiversity will provide a basis for many other \r\nfields of biology.\r\n",
