 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Conference on Multiscale Methods and Partial Differential \r\nEquations will be held at UCLA on August 26-27, 2005. The objective of this \r\nconference is to bring together researchers, students and practitioners with \r\ninterest in the theoretical,  computational and practical aspects of multiscale \r\nproblems and related partial differential equations. The conference will \r\nprovide a forum to exchange and stimulate new ideas from \r\ndifferent disciplines, and to formulate new challenging multiscale problems \r\nthat will have impact in applications. Despite considerable progress in a \r\nwide range of the sciences, and  a growing awareness of the importance \r\nof multiscale approaches, currently there is fragmentation in multiscale \r\nmethodology, its rigorous analysis and its applications. There is an urgent \r\nneed to develop systematic multiscale analysis and computational\r\nmethods that can be applied to a wide range of practical problems. This \r\neffort poses new challenge to the theory of partial differential equations. \r\nBy bringing together analysts, experts in multiscale modeling,\r\nand computational scientists, we can identify the key issues in multiscale \r\nmathematics and common themes of various multiscale problems arising \r\nfrom different disciplines. This provides a unique opportunity to make \r\nsignificant advances in this area.\r\n\r\nAdvances of computational sciences in the past few decades have resulted \r\nin an increase of several orders of magnitude in computing power. \r\nModeling and simulations of physical problems in a narrow range of \r\nscales have been quite successful. However, to solve complex \r\nphysical problems which involves a wide range of spatial or \r\ntemporal scales remains to be a major challenge in many scientific \r\ndisciplines. These problems are of vital importance to our national\r\ninterests, affecting our policy and technology advances in areas such as \r\nenvironmental science, energy, biology, materials science, and \r\ninformation science. Multiscale analysis, modeling, and simulation is\r\n an emerging new research area which has  already made significant \r\nimpact in many scientific disciplines. There have been many exciting \r\nrecent, but problem specific, advances in multiscale analysis, modeling \r\nand simulation.  Up to now, most work on multiscale modeling and \r\ncomputation has been developed within an individual discipline. \r\nBreakthroughs in specific domains could be applicable in a broader \r\ncontext, but remain isolated. As a result, multiscale descriptions are \r\nnowhere near their potential level of impact, including in education \r\nand industry. One of the main purposes of our multiscale conference \r\nis to integrate these isolated efforts and diverse developments. The \r\nconference will also provide a special opportunity to connect applied \r\nmathematicians with domain experts in multiscale modeling and computation. \r\nThis will help bridge the gap in research and knowledge transfer \r\nbetween mathematics and other application disciplines. \r\n",
