Our previous studies showed the \"proof of concept\" of Eruption, a role-playing simulation of a volcanic hazard, and its impact on decision making using an innovative evaluation strategy that incorporates cognitive science methodologies.  This work also allowed us to identify specific design principles that impact higher-order thinking and increase the effectiveness of CAI laboratories.  Incorporation of these principles into the fully implemented Eruption will increase its impact on higher-order cognitive skills such as decision making, problem solving, and critical analysis.  \r\nThe completed implementation and coincident assessment will further inform the relationship between educational exercises and higher-order critical thinking skills.  This work will also allow further refinement of our cognitive science based assessment methodology.  By creating an objective measure of  educational impact, we can identify specific design principles that increase the potential for reaching student populations with weaker math and science backgrounds and/or those traditionally under-represented in the sciences\r\n",
