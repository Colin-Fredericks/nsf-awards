 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Frieder Jaekle of the Department of Chemistry at Rutgers University- Newark is supported by the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program to perform research that focuses on the preparation and exploration of new inorganic polymers for applications in the field of materials chemistry. Boron-based polymeric Lewis acids of controlled molecular weight and well-defined polymer architecture will be prepared through a modular approach that involves three steps: (1) the controlled synthesis of functionalized polymers of various architectures including homopolymers, random copolymers, block copolymers, and telechelic polymers, (2) the quantitative replacement of the functional groups with boron halides or other strong Lewis acids, and (3) the fine-tuning of the Lewis acidity of the individual sites through high-yield substitution reactions to give access to a family of new polymeric Lewis acids. He will take advantage of the spontaneous and reversible formation of donor-acceptor bonds between Lewis acids and Lewis bases for the development of innovative methods for the synthesis of block copolymers and graft polymers as well as the reversible cross-linking of polymers. Furthermore, Professor Jaekle will use the formation of highly stable anionic borate and cationic boronium centers for the development of new inorganic polyelectrolytes and amphiphilic block copolymers. The described research efforts are likely to result in discoveries of novel thermo-reversible polymers, of polymeric nanostructures, and of new functional materials.\r\n\r\nWith the support of the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program, a \"Materials Chemistry\" Undergraduate Laboratory Course will be developed that includes research level experiments on the living polymerization of olefins, the characterization of conjugated (electro-active) polymers, and the formation of nanoparticles. This effort will enhance the training of a highly diverse student population in the areas of polymer and materials chemistry. A new polymer chemistry Outreach Program with local high schools will also be established in an effort at attracting minority students into the sciences.\r\n",
