 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators bring together expertise in the areas of\r\ndifferential equations and numerics, differential geometry, and\r\noptimal control with the goal of developing mathematical modeling\r\nand analysis tools applied to the creation and testing of new\r\ncombinations of chemo-immunotherapies for treating cancer.  The\r\ninvestigators, together with their students, carry out work along\r\nthree complementary paths.  First, dynamical systems population\r\nmodels are created and analyzed to determine fundamental system\r\nbehavior that helps guide the development of combination\r\ntherapies.  Second, differential geometry approaches allow for\r\nthe analysis of idealized geometric forms approximating physical\r\nstructures of spherical, cylindrical, elliptic, and harmonic\r\nspherical tumors, which can closely approximate certain in vivo\r\ntumor geometries.  Third, optimal control theory is used to\r\nreveal paths to new optimal combination therapies with\r\nimplementation of a variety of constraints to minimize tumor\r\nburden while keeping the patient's immune and normal cell\r\npopulations above a healthy threshold.  The results of these\r\ninvestigations have the potential to provide guidance in the\r\nstructuring of improved patient-specific treatment protocols. \r\n\r\n     The mathematical modeling of cancer growth and combination\r\ntreatment strategies adds to our basic understanding of cancer\r\nresponse mechanisms in fundamental ways.  The simulations,\r\ngeometric visualization, and optimization the investigators\r\nundertake allow for an array of virtual experiments to be run\r\nthat can be performed quickly with no risk to living persons, but\r\nthat provide data that can significantly benefit medical decision\r\nmaking.  The modeling of cancer growth and treatment requires\r\nskills from multiple disciplines.  A major outcome of this\r\nproject is the development of software for simulating and\r\nvisualizing cancer growth and treatment pathways, involving\r\nchemotherapy and immunotherapy, which can result in the creation\r\nof new mathematically guided patient-specific combination\r\ntreatment strategies.  This work lies at the intersection of\r\ninformation technology and biotechnology, with mathematics at the\r\ncore.  The investigators have the ability to funnel discoveries\r\nfor new treatment strategies suggested by the mathematics\r\ndirectly to collaborating clinical oncologists through the\r\nongoing meetings of a California-based Mathematics of Medicine\r\nStudy group. In turn, the physicians in this group can enhance\r\nthe development of the mathematical models by sharing outcomes of\r\nongoing clinical trials.  The investigators directly involve\r\nundergraduates in the multiple facets of this cutting-edge\r\nendeavor through research assistantships, courses, and\r\nindependent study.  A unique aspect of this project is the\r\ncollaboration of three women investigators who are attracting\r\nmore women students to this area of research.  The investigators\r\nas a team can serve as role models on the forefront of the fight\r\nagainst cancer, and in particular are in a good position to\r\naffect breast cancer studies, which are of special importance to\r\nwomen's health.  The results from solving the challenging\r\nmathematical, computational and biological problems of this\r\nproject are made publicly accessible through publications and\r\nweb-based postings.  This collaborative effort has the potential\r\nto help clinicians save lives and reduce the suffering of cancer\r\npatients. \r\n",
