 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators are developing Bayesian statistical models for the          \r\nstudy of the distribution of climate system properties. The study is            \r\nbased on output from the MIT 2DLO climate model as well as an estimation        \r\nof the natural climate variability from atmosphere-ocean general                \r\ncirculation models (AOGCM). The statistical models account for all              \r\nuncertainties by focusing on the estimation of the main patterns of             \r\nnatural variability. This is achieved by building prior distributions           \r\nfor the covariance matrix from ensemble runs of AOGCMs.  Particular             \r\nattention is paid to the spectral decomposition of the covariance               \r\nmatrix. In addition the statistical models are hierarchical in order to         \r\nconsider all sources of errors in a comprehensive way. These errors             \r\ninclude the interpolation error due to the impossibility of evaluating          \r\nclimate models in a time short enough to embed it within a Monte Carlo         \r\niterative estimation method.\r\n\r\n  The proposed research falls clearly into the ``Representing                   \r\nuncertainty in geosystems'' theme of the NSF Program for Collaborations         \r\nin Mathematical Geosciences. The main focus is to improve the estimates         \r\nof parameters that govern the large-scale behavior of the climate               \r\nsystem. The resulting analysis will include an assessment of the                \r\nuncertainty of those estimates. The research is a collaborative effort          \r\nbetween climate scientists and statisticians as it requires the use of          \r\nclimate system models as well as analyzing climate observational                \r\ndatasets. The broader aspect of this project is that the estimated              \r\nuncertainties in climate system behavior can be used for uncertainty            \r\nanalysis of climate change projections. By enhancing the ability to             \r\nanalyze the risks of climate change on society, this research will              \r\nprovide valuable input to policymakers.\r\n",
