 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal  aims  to develop  highly  programmable  and efficient .bottom-up. methods  for \r\nconstructing nanoelectronic circuits, using DNA nanoarchitectures as scaffolds and sequence \r\nspecific molecular lithography as a tool to combinatorially organize metallic and semiconducting \r\nnanowires  into  rationally  designed  ensembles  with  potential  applications  of  self-assembling \r\nfunctional nanoelectronic devices. Designer DNA nanoscaffolds are emerging as the material of \r\nchoice for creating sophisticated nanopatterns with the potential capability to pattern nano-scale \r\nobjects with addressability, but their successful integration with functional nanomaterials requires \r\ninterdisciplinary studies. \r\n \r\nIntellectual merit of proposed research: \r\n \r\nThe  programmed  and  efficient  self-assembly  of  rationally  defined  nanoelectronic  circuit \r\npatterns  is  presently  one  of  the  outstanding  challenges  in  nanotechnology.  The main research \r\nobjective  of  this  collaborative  project  is  to  demonstrate  that  self-assembly  of  addressable \r\nmolecular  lithographic  template  can  be  achieved  using  DNA  based  self-assembly.  A  team  has \r\nbeen assembled whose collective expertise can comprehensively address the most pressing issues \r\nin developing DNA nano-architectures as spatially addressable  templates  for metallic and \r\nsemiconducting  nanowire  ensembles. Two  main  goals  will  be  achieved  through  this  proposed \r\nresearch:  1) Design and demonstrate self-assembly  of DNA nanostructures  to form patterned \r\nlattices containing sequence specific template for DNA based molecular lithography.  2) Bridge \r\nthe gap between researches in DNA based molecular lithography and DNA self-assembly to \r\ndevelop  combinatorial  methods  for  highly  programmable  nanoelectronic  circuit  .bottom-up. \r\nassembly.   \r\n \r\nBroader impact of proposed research: \r\n \r\nThe broader impacts of this project include potentially significant influence on the production \r\nof  future  integrated  circuits  and  microprocessors.  Additional  impact  will  occur  in  educating \r\nstudents  about  the  various  aspects  of  constructing  nanoelectronic  systems.  Efforts  will  be \r\ncontinued in recruiting underrepresented students including minorities and women and train them \r\nin DNA based nanotechnology. Undergraduate and high school students will also be recruited to \r\nthis  project.  Distribution  of  our  results  will  occur  through  various  scientific  publications, \r\ninteractions with industrial partners, and through Duke University.s Center for Nano-science and \r\nMaterials.  A  cohesive  set  of  courses  that  address  the  important  aspects  of  nanoscale computer \r\ndevice research will be designed. This includes topics in DNA Nanotechnology, Nanoelectronic \r\nDevices and Architectures. \r\nAs another important educational component, a .DNA-based nanotechnology web site. aimed \r\nat  a  general  public  audience  will  be  designed. The PI  and  co-PI.s  access  to  talented  computer \r\nscience students enable us to implement such a web site with a user-friendly interface. The impact \r\nof DNA nanotechnology can be brought to its full potential by integrating the proposed research \r\nwith a complementary training and knowledge transfer program. A Web-based channel will help \r\npromote DNA nanotechnology in the public domain.  \r\nThis proposal falls into the following EMT theme: advance the fundamental capabilities of \r\ncomputer  and  information  sciences  and  engineering  by  incorporating  insights  from  nanoscale \r\nscience and engineering.",
