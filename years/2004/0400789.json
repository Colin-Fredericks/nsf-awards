A recently discovered formula\r\nexpressing the volume of projections in terms of the Fourier transform\r\nof the curvature function, has led to Fourier analytic proofs of\r\nseveral results on projections, including the characterization of projection bodies in terms of sections of the polar body, and the\r\nFourier analytic solution to Shephard's problem (asking whether symmetric convex bodies with smaller projections necessarily have smaller volume) surprisingly similar to that of the Busemann-Petty problem (a section counterpart of the Shephard problem). \r\nThe similarities in the Fourier analytic proofs of these results\r\nindicate in particular that there must exist deep dual connections between volumes of projections and sections of convex bodies.\r\nTo achieve progress in obtaining the Fourier analytic description of this duality phenomena, the PI plans  to find extremal projections of certain classes of bodies, to undertake a further study of the projection and intersection bodies, to obtain results concerning non-central sections, and to construct a nonsmooth projection body\r\nwhose polar is also a projection body in higher dimensions.\r\n\r\nConvexity is a very old topic which can be traced at very least to Archimedes. It is still in favor due to its numerous applications to linear programming, tomography, medicine, and it is  a surprise that \r\nFourier analytic methods have been applied to the subject only very recently. These methods can serve as an additional source of ideas, coming to both  fields, convex geometry and harmonic analysis, and will find new applications. At the same time, convexity is an extremely simple and natural notion. Interesting in itself, it also illustrates some facts about mathematics, facts that are more or less classical, but always important to realize, so it is a perfect field for undergraduates. First of all, questions or problems arise that are very simple to formulate and understand, so students do not need to take several classes before approaching the material.\r\nSecondly, intuition is sometimes misleading in ``obvious problems'', and the undergraduate feels the beauty of the subject. Many problems can be solved by fairly elementary means, but on the other hand, answers to many problems are still unknown or have been found recently,\r\noften using different techniques from other parts of mathematics.\r\nTherefore, it is a perfect field for research projects for more senior students and all people dealing with exact sciences.\r\n\r\n",
