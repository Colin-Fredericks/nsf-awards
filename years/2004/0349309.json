 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Career project, the investigator studies problems\r\nthat involve an interplay between algebraic geometry, number\r\ntheory, and complexity theory.  Specific projects include:\r\n (1) A new generation of fast randomized algorithms for real root\r\n     counting, allowing analytic as well as algebraic equations,\r\n (2) Further explorations into algorithmic fewnomial theory over\r\n     the real and p-adic numbers,\r\n (3) A deeper analysis of numerical conditioning of random sparse\r\n     polynomial systems,\r\n (4) Sharpened quantitative results for rational solutions of\r\n     straight-line programs,\r\n (5) Further exploration of number-theoretic approaches to the P\r\n     vs. NP question.\r\n\r\n     Solving equations is ubiquitous in applications, cutting\r\nacross many areas of engineering and science: A brief list\r\nincludes drug design, faster and more reliable methods for radar\r\nimaging and geometric modelling, and more reliable and efficient\r\napproaches to robotics and autonomous vehicles.  The investigator\r\ndevelops methods for problems related to the solution of\r\npolynomial equations, with an eye toward these applications. He\r\nalso actively recruits students from schools in poorer areas of\r\nTexas (with large African-American and Hispanic populations) to\r\nhelp disadvantaged students and channel more bright young people\r\ninto the computational sciences.  He also continues work on\r\nrelated software, so that the broader public can benefit from the\r\ndiscoveries of this project.\r\n",
