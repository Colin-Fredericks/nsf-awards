 "awd_abstract_narration": "We plan to study several random structures, such as the random graphs and\r\nmappings, the random Young tableaux and the plane integer partitions. While\r\na tremendous progress has been achieved in analysis of the Erdos-Renyi \r\nrandom graph process, much less is known about the transitional behavior of the\r\ndirected graph version of this process. One obstacle is a dearth of\r\nenumeratve results for directed graphs. In cooperation with Wormald\r\nthe proponent plans to work on asymptotic counts of digraphs by the vertex \r\ndegrees, using some ideas of their prior research on undirected graphs. The \r\nproponent is confident that this study will result in a detailed description of \r\nthe phase transition in the random digraph. The proponent plans to analyze an \r\nalternative graph process suggested by Lovasz, in which the new edges appear with \r\nprobabilities proportional to the resulting vertex degrees. This analysis will require \r\nsolving a host of natural extensions of classic graph enumeration problems. Inspired by \r\nthe work of Propp and Wilson, and Dalal-Schmutz, the proponent plans to study the \r\ncollapse time of the compositions of the independent random mappings. The proponent will \r\ncontinue a study of the likely shapes of random plane and solid diagrams, and will try \r\nto answer open questions formulated in two recent studies of an optimal partitioning \r\nproblem, conducted jointly with Borgs, Chayes and Mertens. \r\n\r\nHowever idealized, the random graph methodology provides a way to describe dynamics\r\nof large evolving networks. We hope that our work on the graph processes will contribute \r\nto a better understanding of an \"abrupt change\" phenomenon characteristic\r\nfor real-life networks, when addition of few connections leads to formation of a tight\r\n\"core\". Our continued study of the partitioning problem will provide a deeper insight\r\ninto critical dependence of its algorithmic complexity on the relations between the random\r\ninput parameters. We believe that this analysis will serve as a model\r\nfor study of a broader class of combinatorial optimization problems important in\r\napplications, such as the \"knapsack\" problem and the \"bin packing\" problems.\r\n",
