 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nParasitoids, which are an important component of most terrestrial\r\necosystems, are parasitic animals (mostly wasps, flies, and nematodes)\r\nthat kill their hosts as part of their normal life cycle. Plants, their\r\ninsect herbivores, and the parasitoids that attack those herbivores\r\nrepresent more than half of all described organisms in the world.\r\n\"Caterpillars and parasitoids in the Eastern Andes of Ecuador\" consists of\r\nan intensive plant, caterpillar, and parasitoid inventory at the Yanayacu\r\nBiological Station (YBS) in the Ecuadorian Andes. The primary objectives\r\nare to: 1) Collect and catalog the diverse community of caterpillars and\r\nassociated parasitoids at this site and to provide specimens for\r\nsystematics (classification of organisms and their evolutionary\r\nrelationships). 2) Disseminate this information with a searchable database\r\naccessible to scientists and the public throughout the world. 3) Collect\r\nbaseline natural history information such as specialized associations\r\nbetween plants, herbivores, and parasitoids; development rates; and other\r\nlife cycle information for both known and undescribed species. 4) Provide\r\nthe foundation for an identification key to the caterpillars of the\r\nEcuadorian Andes. Caterpillar collecting and rearing will take place in a\r\ncloud forest on the eastern slope of the Andes in Napo province, Ecuador,\r\ncentered around the YBS. Collecting will be conducted by carefully\r\ninspecting selected plant species along transects and also by\r\nopportunistically collecting all caterpillars observed in the collecting\r\narea. Caterpillars and parasitoids will be reared to adults. Adult\r\nbutterflies, moths, and parasitoids will be distributed to a network of\r\ncollaborating specialists for identification and for descriptions of new\r\nspecies, revisions, and evolutionary studies.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed activity includes\r\nsignificant advances in insect classification by providing specimens to\r\nexperts as well as providing a critical inventory that can be used in the\r\nconservation of biodiversity. Forests of the equatorial Andes are\r\nrecognized as a global hotspot of biodiversity that is being destroyed at\r\nan alarming rate, but conservation efforts are improving. The current\r\nsurvey will make an important contribution towards documenting and\r\ndescribing the caterpillars and parasitoids of this threatened area, and\r\nwill increase the local value of the Andean forests by providing\r\nscientific and economic incentives for their conservation. The ecology and\r\nsystematics that are a part of this study will also be used to address a\r\nvariety of basic and applied questions in ecology and evolutionary\r\nbiology, ranging from the evolution of unique plant-insect interactions to\r\nthe conservation and management of biodiversity. The broader impacts of\r\nthis project include direct involvement of 4 local field assistants, 3\r\nEcuadorian students, 3 Ecuadorian senior scientists, 1 postdoctoral\r\nresearcher, at least 12 collaborating insect specialists, and various\r\ngraduate and undergraduate students. Therefore the project strengthens\r\ninternational scientific dialogue and relationships. The overall project\r\nwill include enhancements in science education and research experience\r\nprograms for minorities. Finally, the research will enhance training in\r\nsystematics to help stem the decline in expertise that is currently having\r\na negative impact on all disciplines in biology.\r\n",
