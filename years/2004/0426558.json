 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project's research involves development and deployment of an integrated and practical grid  \r\narchitecture  for  data  driven  intra-operative  volumetric  simulation  of  brain  deformation  during  \r\nimage  guided  therapy  (IGT)  and  specifically  for  image  guided  neurosurgery  (IGNS)  to  be  \r\nemployed  in  the  operating  room  of  the  future.    Preliminary  work  has  resulted  in  a  prototype  \r\ndynamic data driven system, which resides locally in the operating room for IGNS that integrates  \r\ndata acquisition, surgical navigation, quantitative monitoring and enhanced real-time control. The  \r\nproposed project will enable improvement in the safety and efficacy of brain tumor resection by  \r\nextending  the  current  system  with  a  tightly  coupled  capability  for  interactively  steered  and  \r\nadaptive data driven simulation of the dynamically shifting shape of the brain. Such simulation  \r\ncapability,  integrated  with  real-time  intra-operative  data  acquisition  capability  and  real-time  \r\nsurgical  resection,  requires  on-demand  low  latency  fault  tolerant  robust  and  reliable  access  to  \r\nremotely located significant compute capacity and data management resources from the operating  \r\nroom. Recent advances in grid infrastructure hold out the promise to pioneer such capability. The  \r\noverall objective of this projectl is the development of a novel grid architecture integrating real- \r\ntime  data  to  allow  intra-operative  surgical  decision-making  and  navigation  during  IGT.  In  \r\naddition this will provide database infrastructure for post-surgical analysis and modeling of data  \r\nand image repositories. The project's information technology (IT) research is expected to have  \r\nbroad impact on clinical practice within a period of a few years.  \r\n",
