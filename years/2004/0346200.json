 "awd_abstract_narration": "A variety of seismic data is available to image the structure associated with \r\nthe western U.S.  Because each data type is sensitive to different aspects of Earth structure, \r\nthey tend to produce different images.  The investigators in this study are inverting all available \r\nseismic data to create a single image that satisfies the combined data set.  This best-possible \r\nimage is being used to understand (1) how previous geologic events - especially the Rocky \r\nMountain event - continue to influence western U.S. tectonic activity, and (2) where there is a critical need for additional seismic data.  This second point is timely as the seismology community embarks on a major effort to improve the quality of seismic imaging under the U.S. with the USArray component of EarthScope.  As USArray data become available, these data will be included to provide an improved quality of seismic image.  Software being developed by these investigators to integrate different types of seismic data is to be made available to the community, as are the images that they create.\r\n",
