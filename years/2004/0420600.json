 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to the State University of New York (SUNY) College at Geneseo under the direction of Dr. Wendy Pogozelski for acquisition of a DNA sequencer.  The sequencer will be used to expand the number and scope of undergraduate projects offered in DNA research and to support new curriculum initiatives in DNA sequencing, DNA computing, and bioinformatics. \r\n\r\nThe research activities, designed for undergraduate involvement, include the identification of regions of human mitochondrial DNA that are subject to deletions when treated with gamma rays; comparison of the mitochondrial DNA codes of various strains of mice; studying the genetic relationships cannibalistic embryos in a brood of the Antarctic sea star; identifying microbes for bioremediation in the Kyzil Kum desert of Uzbekistan, and determining DNA sequences of long DNA strands that represent patterns or codes in DNA computing problems.  In addition, the sequencer is be used for verification of DNA sequences and rRNA sequences in the Biochemistry Laboratory class and Microbiology Laboratory classes at Geneseo.  \r\n\r\nThese projects are of use to society in that they represent efforts in developing new tools for biodosimetry (ways to measure accidental radiation damage in humans), preventing depletion of Antarctic marine life, partnering with the international scientific community for environmental bioremediation and stabilization, developing new methods for computing in an effort to solve computationally hard problems, and developing good models for mitochondrial DNA diseases.  In addition, they are vital tools in educating undergraduates in the DNA sciences and preparing them for careers in scientific research.  \r\n",
