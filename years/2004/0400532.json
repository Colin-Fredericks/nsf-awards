 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will help fund an investigation of the climate history of the northern Great Plains, across the Eocene-Oligocene transition, by analyzing oxygen isotopes found in the phosphate of fossil teeth of a variety of mammals.  This transition was one of the Cenozoic's most abrupt climatic events, changing a greenhouse world into an icehouse world.  By quantifying isotopic changes in mammalian teeth, the researcher aims to quantify changes in diet and water resources as they relate to regional temperature, humidity, and seasonality.  A further science aim is to examine the timing and rate of climate change on the continent and compare it with the marine record to broaden the perspective of the research.  \r\n\r\nThe results of the study will be made readily available to a broad segment of state and national parks across the Great Plains thereby connecting to the million-plus visitors who visit the sites each year.  This research project will provide a unique educational experience for a graduate student who will be intimately involved with the research team.",
