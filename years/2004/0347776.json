Folding problems arise in surprisingly many contexts, ranging from pure computational geometry to ad-hoc wireless networks to protein folding.  This research aims to build a basic theory of geometric folding and, as this theory develops, to explore potential applications throughout science and engineering.  Potential applications include air-bag design, space deployment, and drug design.\r\n\r\nThis research addresses several fundamental unsolved problems in geometric folding.  How can one efficiently compute motions that reconfigure a planar chain linkage between any two desired configurations?  Do such motions always exist for 3D chain linkages whose edge lengths are all equal?  Which configurations of proteins (viewed as a 3D chain linkage) can be biosynthesized by a ribosome?  How efficiently can one-design proteins in the hydrophobic-hydrophilic model that fold stably into a desired shape? How efficiently can wireless beacons locate themselves in a global geometry given just local information about their neighbors? How efficiently can be design optimal foldings of paper into desired shapes?  How many pieces must a polyhedron be cut into to unfold without overlap?  In addition to solving problems such as these, the investigator is coauthoring a book about folding and is pursuing education of folding both as an interesting area in its own right and as a vehicle for presenting material in other areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
