 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the need for a hands-on laboratory component for technology education using a novel distance learning approach, the Remote Studio Laboratory (RSL). Specialized technology programs at two-year college institutions and educational outreach programs in high schools benefit from the implementation of the RSL.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to enhance recruitment and training of technicians through the development of a remote studio laboratory concept. The goal is being met by increasing faculty ability to produce distance learning laboratory based curricula utilizing the studio approach, adapting materials being developed under an existing grant to a distance laboratory format, designing and developing a remote student laboratory prototype system where the laboratory is local to the student, and evaluating the distance lab prototype as an educational outreach tool to increase the awareness of the technician career choice at the high school level. Examples of activities include the development of a data and image acquisition portable laboratory and a set of laboratory exercises for an introductory physics and optoelectronics technology course. \r\n\r\nProject outcomes include students with working knowledge of hands-on experiments which reinforce concepts in introductory courses. The RSL approach removes geographic and other barriers and is used to improve student learning. The RSL enhanced course is being used in high schools as a recruiting tool for technology education. \r\n\r\nThis project is in collaboration with National Instruments, the Infotonics Technology Center, Imaging and Sensing Technology, the COPE alliance, and Southern Tier Tech Prep. This network includes technology education partners at the high school, two-year college, four-year technology college, supplier, and industry level. Members at each level are evaluating the RSL hardware and laboratory experiments developed.\r\n\r\nMaterials developed by this project are being disseminated by web sites and via the Academic Solutions CD-ROM of National Instruments. Publication of the RSL prototype is expected in articles in The Physics Teacher, the International Journal of Engineering Education and at professional conferences.\r\n\r\n",
