These radios offer a higher data rate and robustness in addition to the added functionality in the performance of wireless systems.  Concurrent multi-function transceivers comprise an integral part in building more interdependencies among various otherwise disjointed networks; they are essential in having a coherent, uninterrupted, and reliable flow of information in a heterogeneous infrastructure at times of crises.\r\n\r\nOur treatment includes proposition for various transceiver architectures; development of novel circuit blocks and subsystems; analysis, formulation, and characterization of multi-function radio system and building blocks; and integrated implementations using standard silicon technologies.  The nature of the proposed research topic compels the integration of multiple disciplines such as devices, circuits, electromagnetic theory, control, computation, and communication systems into a robust, but flexible, platform in order to achieve the desired goals.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed research effort lies within its educational aspects and the transfer of technological results to the technical community and the industry.  From the educational perspective, the PIs plan to recruit diverse doctoral electrical engineering students with multi-disciplinary skills in order to combine circuit design with electromagnetic, control, and communication system issues.  They will also recruit outstanding undergraduates destined for graduate study to facilitate their immersion into this multidiscipl\r\n",
