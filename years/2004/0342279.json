 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research coordination network synthesizes approaches to understand and predict biological invasions.  The work involves 39 participants and pulls together data from molecular genetics, insect museum collections, and statistical computation.  Networking activities include: (1) database development, (2) workshops on particular invasive species, (3) research exchanges to develop methodology; (4) annual symposia; and (5) focus groups to address urgent and emerging issues associated with invasive species.\r\n\r\nBiological invasions are of major ecological and economic concern and their impacts are likely to increase as a result of global transportation and trade. However, the development of the field of invasion biology into a predictive science is hampered by incomplete information:  for most alien invasive species broad-scale spatial and temporal patterns are unknown and for many species even their identity is uncertain.  This project studies terrestrial arthropods (particularly insects) because of their impact in a variety of natural and managed habitats and the need to coordinate efforts of researchers at institutions with different missions (e.g., basic research, applied management, education).  The RCN will provide training at a range of levels both nationally and internationally.  The project will benefit the fields of natural science, agriculture, and biosecurity, and will also provide web-accessible information on alien invasive species for students, researchers, and policy makers.\r\n",
