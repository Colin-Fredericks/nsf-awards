 "awd_abstract_narration": "A basic question in geochemistry is whether or not there is chemical \r\nexchange accompanying the transfer of heat from the core to the \r\nmantle in the cooling cycle of the Earth. It has been previously \r\nproposed that minor mass transfer from the outer core to a mantle \r\nplume rising from the core-mantle boundary would be indicated if \r\ncertain, coupled variations in 186Os/188Os and 187Os/188Os ratios are \r\ndetected in lavas derived from the plume. To examine this issue, \r\n186Os/188Os and 187Os/188Os ratios of rocks from two plume-derived, \r\nocean island basalt systems will be precisely measured. There is also \r\nstrong mass balance evidence that the core has a 182W/184W ratio that \r\nis approximately 2 parts in 10,000 lower than the ambient mantle. A \r\nportion of this signal could be transferred to a plume, as with the \r\nOs isotopes. Consequently, techniques will be developed to examine \r\nthe same plume-derived rocks for W isotopes at the 5-15 parts per \r\nmillion level that will likely be necessary to detect  a core \r\ncomponent. The ability of Os and W isotopes to serve as tracers of \r\ncore input to mantle plumes require a good understanding of \r\nmetal/silicate partitioning behavior of these and allied elements, \r\nunder high-pressure conditions. Consequently, high-pressure \r\npartitioning will be examined experimentally. Finally, a variety of \r\nphysical mechanisms of the transfer of core metal into the mantle \r\nwill be considered and evaluated.",
