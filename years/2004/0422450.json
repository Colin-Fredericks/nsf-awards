 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is allowing the Appalachian College Association (ACA), a non-profit organization of 34 small, private, liberal arts institutions in the Appalachian areas of five states (Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia) with more than 38,000 students, to award 30 two-year scholarships of $2,750 per year to rising juniors at ACA institutions who have declared majors in computer science or computer information science/systems, engineering programs; or mathematics or mathematical science.  It offers five research/internship opportunities to scholarship students on a competitive basis; and supports all scholarship recipients through personal and internet communication with other Scholars, training in career planning, and support from academic, research, and business mentors.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: this project continues and enhances a program funded with an NSF CSEMS grant (2001-2004) that awarded one- or two-year scholarships to 54 different students at 16 ACA institutions. Based on what was learned from the previous project, this project is strengthening the content of the annual meetings for scholarship recipients, adding a competitive research/internship opportunity for selected scholars, and providing closer connection between students and faculty mentors throughout the scholarship period and beyond.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: communities in the Appalachian area have many of the economic characteristics typical of such minorities. This project is having a positive effect on the students selected, the schools they attend, and central Appalachia.",
