 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Mixing in Math\" is a multi-dimensional, three-year project that seeks to build the capacity of after-school programs to provide meaningful and engaging math activities for youth.  Program collaborators including project leaders from TERC and after-school program leaders will reach approximately 40,000 children through at least 350 sites and approximately 9,000 staff and volunteers.  Drawing on the unique features of the after-school environment, the project design includes the following elements:  development of materials appropriate to the setting; staff development and support; institutionalization and dissemination of materials throughout an established network and evaluation research to further knowledge about informal math and after-school programming.  Project goals are to:  provide free math materials to all participating after-school staff; produce a significant increase in informal math training for the after-school workforce; strengthen the role of informal math in after-school settings; and conduct and disseminate research on the project in terms of its impact on after-school programming, informal math education and the math \"achievement gap.\"  \"Mixing in Math\" national partners will facilitate further reach of the project.  The National Institute of Out of School Time (NIOST) in addition to posting materials on their website, will incorporate project activities into their staff development programs.  Ceridian, a work-life benefits provider, will distribute project materials to workplace school-ages childcare programs.",
