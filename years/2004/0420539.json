 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program in DMR will allow Coe College to purchase a scanning probe microscope. The microscope will allow Coe College researchers to study a variety of novel surface effects in the areas of physics, chemistry, and biology. The researchers will look at light scattering by roughened glass surfaces, phase separation in borosilicates and borovanadates, and corrosion of varied glass families by aggressive gas radicals, dilute acids, and water.  Other studies will focus on the effect of surface features on the mechanisms of reductive transformations of pollutants in water by zero- and low-valent metals, and on the formation of biocements by sea worms.  The first external use will carry out electrochemical measurements on colloidal particles that have been functionalized with polyoxometalates. Over ten undergraduate students, from Coe and its associated REU site, will receive training in the techniques of nanoscience every year.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Major Research Instrumentation program in DMR will allow Coe College to purchase a scanning probe microscope. The scanning probe microscope will allow the researchers to carry out new work in physics, chemistry, and biology.  The microscope will permit the researchers to see how tiny features in glass scatter light, like in frosted panes, and how water, acids, and corrosive gases can also damage glass surfaces.  In the environmental chemistry project the PI's will observe the role of iron oxidation on the reactions of pollutants in water.  The microscope will allow them to investigate the way that sea worms cement sand grains together to make sea reefs, even underwater.  Another project will study how tiny particles (colloids) can be made more useful by attaching specialized molecules on their surface.  The microscope will also help train many undergraduates in the techniques of nanoscience, an area of national importance and growing interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
