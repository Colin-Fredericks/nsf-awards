 "awd_abstract_narration": "0428220\r\nShinar\r\n\r\nThe objective of this proposal is to develop novel photoluminescence \r\n(PL)-based sensors that are fully structurally integrated: The light \r\nsource, the sensing element, and the photodetector (PD) and associated \r\nfilter, are fabricated on transparent substrates and attached \r\nback-to-back. The resulting sensors could therefore be extremely \r\ncompact, robust, selective, fast, autonomous, consume little power, and \r\ninexpensive. The proposal focuses on sensing oxygen, a key tool in \r\nmedical, environmental, (bio)chemical, and food monitoring, and Bacillus \r\nanthracis toxin (anthrax).\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit. The central concept is the novel total \r\nstructural integration of the foregoing components. The light source is \r\nan array of organic light-emitting device (OLED) pixels. The sensing \r\nelements include porous films with an embedded dye, surface immobilized \r\nspecies whose PL is selectively analyte-sensitive, or microfluidic \r\nchannels/wells with recognition elements in solution. The PD and filter \r\nare multilayer thin films of hydrogenated nanocrystalline Si, SiGe, \r\nand/or SiC. The geometry will be \"back detection,\" i.e., the OLED and PD \r\npixels are fabricated on the same side of the substrate. The array of \r\nlong-pass filters and PD pixels is fabricated first, followed by the \r\nOLEDs in the gaps between the PD pixels. The sensing element is \r\nfabricated on a separate substrate and attached to the OLED/PD \r\nsubstrate. In the complete device, the electronic circuitry (including \r\ninstruction receiver and data transmitter), readout, and battery will be \r\npositioned \"behind\" the PD. Hence the whole device would be ~2.5\"x5\"x1\", \r\nfar more compact and less costly than any sensors currently available. \r\nThe work results in a new platform for PL-based sensors, which can be \r\nfurther developed to multianalyte sensor microarrays. Innovative \r\nelements are (i) the complete integration of all the sensor components, \r\nand (ii) the development of sensing elements utilizing microfluidic \r\narchitectures and films/surfaces tailored for specific recognition \r\nmolecules, which will enhance the sensitivity and shorten the response \r\ntime. Moreover, the OLEDs will be operated in a pulsed mode, which will \r\nincrease their lifetime and generate negligible heat, which is crucial \r\nfor heat-sensitive recognition elements and agents. Oxygen will be \r\nmonitored via the PL lifetime, thus eliminating the need for frequent \r\ncalibration.\r\n\r\nDifferent approaches will be evaluated to generate robust sensors for \r\nreal-world applications. The oxygen sensor will be based on the \r\ndynamical quenching of the PL of oxygen-sensitive dyes, initially with a \r\ngreen OLED and Pt octaethyl porphyrin (PtOEP) dye. We will compare the \r\nsensors with dyes embedded in solid films with dyes solutions. The \r\nanthrax sensor will be based on the cleavage of certain peptides by \r\nanthrax lethal factor. Labeled peptides will be synthesized at the \r\nProtein Facility of Iowa State University (ISU), with a Forster \r\nresonance energy transfer donor and acceptor on either side of the \r\ncleavage site.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts. The sensors for the two aforementioned agents will \r\nbe ideal for a broad range of applications in areas such as homeland \r\nsecurity, medical, environmental, biological, food/brewing, and \r\nhealth/safety. Beyond these impacts, the devices define a new sensor \r\nplatform for chemical and biological agents, which could lead to \r\nextremely compact and inexpensive multianalyte sensor microarrays. The \r\nproposed work will serve as a basis for the development of this \r\nplatform. It will also expand the basic knowledge in \r\nembedding/immobilizing recognition elements, sensor design, and sensor \r\nengineering. It will also have a broad educational impact, promoting the \r\ngrowth of the interdisciplinary biophysics program at ISU and training \r\nstudents in condensed matter physics, electrical engineering, \r\nbiophysics, chemistry, and molecular biology. It will be integrated with \r\nteaching by developing new experimental course modules for graduate \r\nstudents. Significant participation of undergraduates, including \r\nminorities and women, is planned.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
