 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neuropeptides are small signaling molecules that control the development, physiology, and behavior of animals. This proposal uses genetic approaches in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to understand how neuropeptides regulate ecdysis, the behavior used by insects to shed their old exoskeleton (cuticle) at the end of each molt Ecdysis is controlled by a series of interacting neuropeptides. The stereotyped nature of the behavior, coupled with its complex regulation, has made it a premier system for understanding how neuropeptides cause concerted and developmentally appropriate changes in behavior and physiology. Our previous work has established that the neuropeptide Crustacean Cardioactive Peptide (CCAP) plays an important role in regulating Drosophila ecdysis, consistent with findings from the moth. It also revealed that the actions of CCAP are more complex than predicted. This proposal will uses the genetic tools available in Drosophila to understand the bases for CCAP's actions by determining the expression of the CCAP receptor (CCAP-R), and analyzing the role of the different CCAP-R-expressing cells in the control of ecdysis. This work will further our understanding of how neuropeptides control animal behavior and development. It will also specifically advance the understanding of the control of ecdysis behavior, a behavior that is essential for the survival of all insects. Thus, information gained from this research may lead to the development of useful agents of insect control. The research proposed here offers a unique opportunity to receive an unusually broad training in Drosophila biology, including neuroendocrinology, genetics, and behavior. In addition, the results of this research will be used in lecture and practical courses offered by the PI.\r\n",
