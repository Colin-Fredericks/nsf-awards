 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasingly, researchers are discussing and examining the potential influences on human development of families, peers, schools, neighborhoods, communities, and so on. This increased attention to modeling ecological influences highlights a growing need to understand how best to represent and model contextual impacts on human development. This conference will bring together leading developmentalists, quantitative scholars, and statisticians to address ecological/contextual effects as direct influences on development, mediators and/or moderators of change, nested hierarchical levels of influence, and as dynamic systems. In addition to the primary themes of ecological impacts, common methodological concerns will be addressed, including: measurement issues; incomplete data; sample heterogeneity (a person-centered approach); and power and sample size considerations. Each conference participant is explicitly asked to address at least one of the primary themes, consider the methodological concerns, and relate each to the developmental applications, thus allowing for a) appropriate conceptualizations and analyses of ecological factors, b) increased awareness and inclusion of ecological factors in future research, and c) expanded scientific knowledge on the complex interplay among all the factors that contribute to human development. Approximately twenty-five scholars will participate as presenters or discussants with considerable meeting time allocated for round-table discussions of the themes and issues. The 2-day intensive retreat format, to be held in Tempe, Arizona, on March 4-6, 2004, allows significant cross-fertilization of ideas so that each presenter's work will be refined and extended as a result of their direct participation in the conference. The final product is an edited volume to consist of 12-15 chapters, 4-6 commentaries and discussions pieces, and a supporting web site.",
