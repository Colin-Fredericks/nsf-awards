 "awd_abstract_narration": "Millimolar  H2S concentrations and the near absence of oxygen make methane seep sediments one of the most toxic environments on earth, yet metazoan assemblages persist in such settings.  In microbial-mat covered seeps on the upper slopes of the Pacific Northwest, these  assemblages  are  comprised  nearly  exclusively  of  dorvilleid  polychaetes.  At  seeps located within the oxygen minimum zone off the Oregon and California margins the PIs have identified  up  to  17  co-occurring  dorvilleid  species,  including  10  in  a  single  genus.  The PIs hypothesize that this annelid group, through exceptional tolerance to low oxygen and high sulfide concentrations, has found a suite of niches which it alone has been able to exploit, and as a  result has experienced evolutionary  release in the absence  of predators and competitors.  The PIs propose to use this dorvilleid assemblage  as a model system  with which  to  investigate  how  metazoan  communities  evolve  in  and  adapt  to  extreme  sulfide conditions.  By mapping  ecological features onto a phylogenetic framework,  the PIs will  identify  correlations  among  ecology,  physiology,  life  history  and evolutionary history that help elucidate the mechanisms of speciation under extreme stress. The PIs anticipate that dorvilleid polychaetes will ultimately provide a superb metazoan model for integrated extremophile research.  A  partnership  facilitated  by  California  COSEE  (Center  for  Ocean  Science Education Excellence) will allow the PIs to pursue a rigorous education and outreach effort.  Emerging findings will be incorporated as part of a current NSF-funded Sea Floor Science project (ISE #0229063) at the Ocean Institute.",
