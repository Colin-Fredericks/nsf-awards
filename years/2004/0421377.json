PROJECT SUMMARY\r\nWe request funds to acquire a scanning electron microscope that will be capable of high-resolution\r\nelectron imaging and cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and imaging (CL) with 1 nm\r\nresolution. The proposed instrument will be located in the cleanroom (Class 100) in the Micro\r\nand Nanotechnology Laboratory at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The\r\nLaboratory is an interdisciplinary research user facility that houses advanced equipment for\r\nmaterials and device processing. The laboratory has been very successful in facilitating cross-disciplinary\r\nresearch and collaborations. Over 40 faculty, 20 postdoctoral fellows, 200 graduate\r\nstudents, and many undergraduates have access to the laboratory. The users span across various\r\ndisciplines and departments on campus. The user list is steadily growing as we facilitate\r\ndiscussions between various groups on the versatility of nanotechnology. Personnel from\r\nneighboring academic institutions are users of the laboratory also.\r\nThe availability of the proposed SEM+CL system is critical to many research programs active at\r\nthe University of Illinois. Three illustrative examples of these research programs are described in\r\ndetail. These are:\r\nNanoscale Pattern Formation in Soft Materials (John Rogers and Ilesanmi Adesida)\r\nNanophotonics: Quantum Dots and Photonic Crystals (James Coleman and Kent\r\nChoquette)\r\n\r\nSilicon Bionanotechnology (Gregory Timp)\r\nVarious other projects make use of the facilities in the laboratory and among these are the\r\nprojects that have recently being started under the newly awarded NSF Center for Nano-Chemical-\r\nElectrical-Mechanical Manufacturing Systems (Nano-CEMMS) at the University of\r\nIllinois. The proposed research instrumentation is vital to these projects since they involve\r\nfabrication at length scale less than 20 nm.\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal is in the new science and innovations that will be\r\nfacilitated. The proposed instrumentation will enable imaging and spectroscopy at the nano-regime;\r\nunderstanding phenomena in organic and inorganic structures and systems at this scale\r\nwill open a vista to new applications. The proposed instrumentation will facilitate collaborations\r\nacross various disciplines and the research will lead wide-ranging applications in medicine, food,\r\nenvironment and electronics.\r\nFor the broader impact, the proposed instrument will see significant use in\r\ngraduate/undergraduate research and education programs. Minority and under-represented\r\nstudents will be recruited through various mechanisms involving our campus-wide Summer\r\nResearch Opportunity Program (SROP) and through our collaborative programs with minority\r\nserving universities in Centers such as the Nano-CEMMS. Faculty from these schools will have\r\naccess to the laboratory through these Centers also. Programs for k-12 teachers to conduct\r\nsummer research in the laboratory with access to the research instrumentation is in place. Self-operation\r\nof the equipment by all qualified researchers regardless of institutional/departmental\r\naffiliations or source of funding is encouraged so as to enhance their education. With the\r\navailability of the proposed instrumentation, we envisage an increase in usage by and\r\ncollaborations with industry.\r\nThe total estimated cost of acquiring the proposed instrument is $688,338. Of this amount, we are\r\nrequesting $481,837 from the National Science Foundation. The University of Illinois will\r\nprovide cost sharing of $206,501 (30.0 %) of the total cost of the instrument.",
