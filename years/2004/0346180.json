 "awd_abstract_narration": "The collaborative team is developing a powerful suite of interactive, web-based mapping tools for both research and education.  These tools allow near-real-time access to EarthScope data and products. The project builds on several years of development of mapping tools, including the Jules Verne Voyager, Global Strain Rate Map (www.world-strain-map.org), and the EarthScope Voyager tool. These tools make geologic, geophysical, and geodynamic data and models accessible to a broad audience. The global strain rate map model and archive is being updated with each new set of Global Positioning System (GPS) observations that are made available. A specific high-resolution strain rate and velocity field map is being developed for western North America. The research team is also working to develop finite strain animations for both teaching and research. These finite strain simulations are constrained primarily by the instantaneous strain rate solutions now defined by EarthScope and other GPS measurements. Simulations take into account erosion rates, isostatic adjustment of topography, and crustal thickening and thinning rates. Topography points are tracked through time using small time steps. Multiple time steps are combined to provide animations that are excellent for displaying how the plate boundary has evolved, and might evolve, over time. Curricular resources are also being developed that provide the background for K-12 and university levels that will enable educators to utilize the map tools, and the content presented, for instruction. The team is exploring new inquiry-based, interactive curricular modules that build on EarthScope scientific results and technical resources.\r\n\r\n",
