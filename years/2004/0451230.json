 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: DMS-0244994: Byrna Kra\r\n\r\nPenn State University\r\n\r\n\r\nKra proposes research in several areas of ergodic theory and\r\ndifferentiable dynamics, with an emphasis on applications of ergodic\r\ntheory to number theory and combinatorics.  The major area of research is\r\nthe study of ``non-conventional'' ergodic averages, studying ergodic\r\ntheorems for averages of functions where even if the system is ergodic,\r\nthe limit need not be constant.  The investigator proposes studying\r\npolynomial averages, averages for commuting transformations and averages\r\nalong other sequences of recurrence.  Additional lines of research are\r\nbased on her work on circle maps, including connections between the\r\ndifferentiability of the map, the arithmetic properties of its rotation\r\nnumber and the dimension of its invariant limit set.\r\n\r\nThe project studies the long term behavior of systems whose dynamics is\r\ntoo complicated or too chaotic to be understood locally.  Dynamical\r\nsystems are used to model problems in natural and social sciences and\r\ntheir study leads to an understanding of the evolution of the modeled\r\nphenomena.  The educational portion of the project aims to contribute to\r\nthe graduate and undergraduate programs at Penn State University, with\r\nspecial courses designed to inject research into the learning process at\r\nan early stage. In fall 2003, the PI will develop and teach a course on\r\ntopological dynamics and Ramsey Theory in the MASS (Mathematics Advanced\r\nStudies Semesters) program, a long-standing program aimed at talented fourth-year undergraduates chosen in national competition.  The outreach portion aims to make the\r\nMathematics Department at Penn State a more attractive place for women to\r\nstudy and work, with the creation of a focus group on women's issues and\r\nsupport of research projects for undergraduate women.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
