Initiated by the proof of\r\nboundedness of the bilinear Hilbert transform, this type\r\nof analysis has been studied intensely and has led to\r\na series of results on multilinear operators and maximal\r\noperators. 2) Arithmetic number theory, in particular\r\nthe study of arithmetic progressions, sum - and difference sets\r\netc. The link between arithmetic number theory and the\r\ntype of analysis discussed above has recently be reinforced\r\nbe several results on multilinear operators.  Arithmetic number\r\ntheory is also related to other problems in harmonic analysis\r\nsuch as the famous Kakeya problem.\r\n3) Nonlinear Fourier analysis or scattering theory. Via\r\nmultilinear expansions of nonlinear operators in scattering\r\ntheory, the latter is linked to multilinear operators.\r\nWhile the algebraic aspects of scattering theory in one\r\ndimension have been widely studied over the past thirty years,\r\na number of basic analytic questions remain open and will\r\nbe studied in this project.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWave packet analysis is a discipline in mathematics\r\nthat can readily be explained to anyone familiar with\r\nmusical scores. A musical score is the decoding of a\r\ncomplicated musical composition into its most elementary\r\nparts, the notes, each described by duration, pitch, and volume.\r\nWave packet analysis is the mathematical analogue of this,\r\nwhich can be used to decode a large variety of mathematical\r\ndata into its elementary pieces, each described by the analogue of duration, pitch,\r\nand volume.  This type of analysis has had a tremendous impact\r\non the way computers deal with large sets of data coming from\r\nacoustic signals, images, radar,  internet and other telecommunication,\r\netc. This project studies basic mathematical questions associated to wave packet analysis, fundamental research that is likely to\r\nimprove our understanding not only of the types of processes\r\ndescribed above, but also of many different applications within\r\nMathematics as well. This project will also help to maintain an\r\nactive research group in harmonic analysis at UCLA.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
