 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Track 2, GK-12 project builds upon existing relationships and infrastructure developed in the previous GK-12 project with two school districts serving diverse students traditionally underrepresented in engineering and the College of Engineering and Applied Science. \r\n\r\nThe Broader Impact of the project is very high.  Fellows, in partnership with cooperating teachers, are improving STEM literacy in high-needs schools through a grades 3-12 pre-engineering program and are learning to be effective service learning mentors for undergraduate students engaged in K-12 classrooms.  Students are from seven high needs, suburban and urban schools, with large minority enrollments.  \r\n\r\nPart of the Intellectual Merit of the proposal is that the Fellows will use engineering as a vehicle to integrate math and science learning by K-12 students in the seven participating schools.  The Fellows will become \"engineering ambassadors,\" who deliver a hands-on engineering curriculum that addresses state educational STEM standards and serve as role models for grades 3-12 students to link the study of math and science to future careers in engineering and technology.  This project is receiving partial support from the Directorate for Engineering.\r\n\r\n \r\nTitle: Track 2, GK-12: Inspiring and Building Tomorrow's Workforce: A Grades 3-12 Engineering Continuum\r\nInstitution: University of Colorado at Boulder\r\nPI/Co-PI: Jacquelyn Sullivan, Lawrence Carlson and Malinda Schaefer\r\nPartner School Districts: Boulder Valley School District (BVSD), Denver Public Schools (DPS)\r\nNumber of Fellows per Year: 8 graduate students, 2-6 undergraduate engineering students\r\nTarget Audience: Grades 3-12\r\nSetting: Suburban and Urban\r\nNSF Supported Disciplines: Earth, life, general and physical sciences; engineering; mathematics\r\n",
