 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports Northwestern University with the acquisition of a Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS) and some key options. This instrument is manufactured by the Quantum Design Corporation of San Diego, California, which is the sole supplier offering the required options.  This instrument will broadly support a wide range of materials-based programs, much of it nanoscience oriented, here at Northwestern University (and some surrounding institutions) involving various disciplines including Chemistry, Materials Science, Physics, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering.  The Instrument will greatly extend the capability at Northwestern University faculty to synthesize and characterize a wide range of new materials.  Briefly, the instrument will measure static/dynamic magnetic response, electrical/thermal transport properties, and specific heat, at temperatures in the range 0.4K to 400K and at magnetic fields to 9T. A sample rotator will permit studies of the angular dependence of the transport properties. A program to extend the capabilities still further will be initiated including: the static/dynamic magneto-optical Kerr-effect (MOKE) and other optical measurements, sound propagation, and microwave response (there being sufficient sample space in the new cryostat to locate the necessary components).  Some programs which will immediately benefit from the instrumentation include chalcogenide crystal chemistry, magnetic semiconductors, novel Josephson junctions (qubit candidates), and nanocrystalline wires.\r\n%%%\r\nThis award from the Instrumentation for Materials Research program supports Northwestern University with the acquisition of a Physical Properties Measurement System (PPMS) and some key options. This instrument is manufactured by the Quantum Design Corporation of San Diego, California, which is the sole supplier offering the required options.  This instrument will broadly support a wide range of materials-based programs, much of it nanoscience oriented, in Chemistry, Materials Science, Physics, Mechanical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering at Northwestern University and some surrounding institutions.  Northwestern faculty are generally recognized for their ability to synthesize a wide range of new materials and the PPMS will greatly extend their ability to characterize these materials.  Briefly, the instrument will measure magnetic, thermal and electrical properties of materials at various magnetic fields and temperatures.  Most measurements are performed by graduate and undergraduate students associated with the various faculty, and the presence of the instrument will give the students the opportunity to learn about the underlying measurement science associated with the properties being studied.\r\n*** \r\n",
