 "awd_abstract_narration": "The use of soil nails for temporary and, more importantly, permanent support of excavations and slopes is rapidly increasing, particularly for highway widening projects.  It is a very attractive new technology for providing temporary and permanent excavation support in a variety of applications and geologic environments.  However, while the experience has been generally quite positive, the state of art of design of the soil nail support systems has lagged behind due to a lack of verifiable performance data.  This situation is particularly acute when it comes to seismic design, since seismic events are rare and the soil nail technology is relatively new.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this research project is to instrument soil nails in a deep excavation in mixed rock and colluvium on the Campus of the University of California, Berkeley.  The excavation is immediately adjacent to the Hayward Fault zone and within 200 m of the active fault trace.  The Hayward Fault has been assigned the highest probability of generating an earthquake with magnitude >6.7 in the next 30 years in the San Francisco Bay Area, and small events occur very frequently.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the project is to instrument a section of the excavation face and a vertical array of 7 soil nails using strain gauges and accelerometers.  The soil nails, up to 70 feet in length, will be instrumented with paired strained gauges (top and bottom) installed every 10 feet along the length of the soil nail.  In addition, dual axis MEMS accelerometers will be installed at the face of the excavation and at the embedded end of the instrumented nails in order to measure the difference in ground motions between the excavation face and the rock mass at depth.  The dual axis accelerometers will be paired to provide 3 axes of motion at each instrument location, thus allowing the resolution of the ground motions into fault-normal, fault-parallel, vertical components.  In addition to this electronic instrumentation, the excavation face will be continuously monitored with laser surveying instruments to measure the excavation face deformation during excavation and following its completion.  The combined data will then provide the opportunity to correlate observed deformations with the loads developed in the nails and to compare the observed performance with the design loads.\r\n\r\nThus, this site provides a unique opportunity to measure the response of the soil nails and the entire excavation support system under extreme loading.  The seismic response of excavations is one the major unanswered questions in geotechnical earthquake engineering because the problem is difficult to scale in a laboratory, and the well documented field data does not exist.  In particular, the issue of amplification of ground motions in the vicinity of slopes and excavations is very poorly understood, and based on very limited anecdotal and purely analytical evidence.  Hence, new data on this topic should prove invaluable to the research community.\r\n",
