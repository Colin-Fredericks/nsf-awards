 "awd_abstract_narration": "The grant supports junior scientists' participation in the 2004 Gordon\r\nConference on Nuclear Chemistry.   The objective of the Gordon Research\r\nConference on Nuclear Chemistry is to provide the international community of\r\nnuclear scientists with a unique forum where the most recent developments in\r\nthis field can be presented, discussed and criticized.  The emphasis in this\r\nyear's Conference is placed on central nuclear reactions, with a particular\r\nattention devoted to the role of flavors in nuclear dynamics.  Flavor is\r\nwhat distinguishes neutrons from protons in an atomic nucleus and the\r\nnucleons from some more exotic particles.\r\n\r\nThe agenda of this Conference provokes new ideas for future research, in\r\nensuring that discussions facilitate vigorous and open interactions between\r\nscientists. This requires the participation of a significant number of the\r\nleaders, including both internationally recognized senior scientists and the\r\nyoung and rising stars.  Bright and promising postdoctoral researchers and\r\ngraduate students are selected for participation in this Conference and\r\nencouraged to present their ideas. Their participation provides them with\r\nunique and extensive access to the leaders in their field, exposes them to\r\nnew research opportunities and techniques and helps prepare them for the\r\nleadership roles they will assume in the future.  Some of the young\r\nscientists have been invited to present talks.  For others, poster sessions\r\nare organized to provide a forum for their ideas, with best displays\r\nadditionally selected for oral presentations.\r\n\r\n",
