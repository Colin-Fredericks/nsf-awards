 "awd_abstract_narration": "Workshop Proposal: Probability and Materials - links from Nano- to Macro-Scale\r\nWorkshop Chair: Lori Graham-Brady\r\n\r\nProgress in understanding uncertainties in material behavior at the full range from nano- to macro-scale, as well as the development of appropriate links between randomness at different scales, will require contributions from various disciplines, including materials science, applied mechanics and mathematics, and civil and mechanical engineering. Furthermore, connections between experimental, computational and analytical researchers will be a key component to developing an understanding of the relationships between probability and material behavior. This proposal outlines a 3-day invitation-only workshop entitled \"Probability and Materials: from Nano- to Macro-scale\", which is to take place at Johns Hopkins University in June 2004. The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers across multiple disciplines to discuss the state of the art and to define critical future directions in the study of material randomness. Approximately 30-35 speakers are expected to participate in the workshop, on research related to one of three major topics: Data Gathering and Management, Temporal and Spatial Randomness of Materials, and Multi-Scale Modeling. \r\n",
