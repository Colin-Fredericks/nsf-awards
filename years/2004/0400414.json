 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract of Dihua Jiang's proposal (DMS-0400414)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator, Dihua Jiang, works on some basic problems\r\nin the modern theory of automorphic forms and L-functions. In the global\r\ntheory, he investigates the structures of the discrete spectrum of\r\nautomorphic forms and characterizes the non-vanishing of the central values\r\nor the residues of automorphic L-functions in terms of periods of automorphic\r\nforms, using ideas from the classical invariant theory. In the\r\nlocal theory, his research attacks the local Langlands conjectures and\r\nrelated basic problems in harmonic analysis of p-adic groups. His long term\r\ngoal is to understand the general local-global-automorphic principles in the\r\ntheory of automorphic forms, which reflects one of the basic principles in\r\narithmetic and number theory.\r\n\r\nThe theory of automorphic forms has been studied for a long time and was\r\nrooted in the work of Gauss and Riemann among others. It became early on a\r\nmeeting ground for analysis and number theory, and has developed as an\r\nindispensable tool in analytic number theory, algebraic number theory,\r\nDiophantine problems, arithmetic and algebraic geometry, and recently in\r\ninfinite dimensional Lie algebras and mathematical physics. The recent proof\r\nof the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture on elliptic curves and the Fermat's\r\nlast theorem are typical examples. The modern theory of automorphic forms and\r\nL-functions was developed based on the understanding of automorphic forms\r\nin terms of the representation theory of and the harmonic analysis over\r\nlocally compact topological groups. Langlands gave a systematic conjectural\r\ndescription of relations between L-functions in number theory or algebraic\r\ngeometry and those arising in the theory of automorphic forms. Jiang's work\r\nis concentrated on the basic conjectures of Langlands and applications to\r\nnumber thoery.\r\n\r\n",
