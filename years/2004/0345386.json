 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\n\r\nThe Sm complex is an RNA-binding component of the splicesome, the machine that catalyzes mRNA splicing.  However, recent studies suggest that Sm family proteins may have several diverse functions in eukaryotic cells.   The Evans lab has discovered a new function for the Sm complex in early development of the nematode C. elegans.  In the C. elegans embryo, the Sm proteins regulate germ cell specification by a process that is distinct from mRNA splicing. To explore the mechanisms of Sm function, the P.I. and colleagues will study how the Sm complex controls the expression of proteins that localize to germ cell precursors during early embryogenesis.  Interactions between the Sm complex and RNAs known to control germ cell formation will be investigated.  The Sm complex is likely to mediate a new mode of RNA regulation that influences a variety of cell and developmental processes.  Therefore, these studies will likely yield new insights into novel mechanisms of gene regulation.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts of the proposed project:  (1) Education and learning:  This project will provide science training for graduate students and forms the core of their PhD theses.  Students will present findings at local and international meetings as part of their education.  The P.I.'s lab also provides annual tours for local elementary and high school students studying science. (2) Participation of underrepresented groups:  The P.I. is a member of two graduate programs committed to recruitment of underrepresented groups, including a minority student currently in the P.I.'s lab.  (3) Dissemination of results:  Results will be published in broad based scientific journals and presented at international meetings.  In addition, the project will be presented at an annual science fair designed to demonstrate U.C.H.S.C research to the general public.  (4) Enhancement of research infrastructure:  The requested equipment will be openly available for use by other labs.  The P.I. regularly consults with and provides reagents for researchers in other fields who want to study their genes in C. elegans.  (5) Benefits to society:  This project aims to understand novel mechanisms of RNA regulation, which may ultimately lead to new tools for the detection or control of genes important for human, animal, and plant disease.\r\n",
