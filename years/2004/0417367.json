The\r\nproject emphasizes survey and conservation of forest reserves and\r\nirreplaceable sacred groves.  Sacred groves are isolated forest areas that\r\nhave been protected for hundreds of years by indigenous peoples and that\r\nwere within living memory part of continuous forest.  Major goals are to\r\n1) investigate how forest fragmentation impacts communities of\r\nforest-dependent species and to identify what factors promote their\r\npersistence versus extinction, and 2) narrow the pervasive knowledge gap\r\nthat currently exists for the unique forest ecosystems of West Africa. \r\nButterflies are excellent models for evaluating the status of natural\r\ncommunities in degraded landscapes because they show a wide diversity of\r\nrelative sensitivities to environmental change, are tightly linked to\r\necological systems as both primary consumers (herbivores) and food items,\r\nand are easily collected and identified.  Primary field activities\r\nassociated with the project will occur over three years and include\r\nregular and systematic survey of nine forest sites using baited traps and\r\nnet collections, intensive spot surveys of at least six additional unique\r\nforest sites, measurement of forest characteristics at each site (e.g.,\r\nsize and canopy cover), and purposeful collection of caterpillars and\r\ntheir food plant dependencies to amass much needed, but largely\r\nnonexistent, information on species' biology and natural histories.  The\r\nproject will 1) greatly expand our understanding of forest biodiversity in\r\ntropical West Africa, 2) test broad ecological and biogeographic\r\nhypotheses that have relevance beyond this particular system, 3) establish\r\na data and image-rich library of the Ghanaian butterfly fauna on the world\r\nwide web, 4) make species checklists and summary findings rapidly\r\navailable to local communities and conservation agencies to facilitate\r\nscience-based conservation plans, 5) help solidify permanent reference and\r\nmuseum collections in the host country, and 6) generate a reference\r\nframework for future research in molecular biology, ecology, evolution,\r\nand systematics.\r\n\r\nThe project emphasizes education, training, capacity building, and\r\ncultural exchange.  It is an international collaboration that includes\r\noverseas research and professional opportunities for U.S. and Ghanaian\r\nstudents and scientists, and involves cooperating specialists from the\r\nU.S., Britain, Belgium, and Vietnam, and multiple institutions and staff\r\nin the U.S. (Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and Carnegie Museum of\r\nNatural History) and Ghana (Forestry Research Institute of Ghana,\r\nKwame-Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Ghana Wildlife\r\nDivision, and Nature Conservation Research Centre).\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.\r\n",
