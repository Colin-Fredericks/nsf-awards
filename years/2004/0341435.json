 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological Science (61). This CCLI Educational Materials Development proof-of-concept project supports the development and evaluation of a prototype electronic key to the insects of eastern North America.  Unlike traditional identification methods that use dichotomous taxonomic keys in print format, this student-friendly computer-based tool can be entered at multiple access points, thereby encouraging exploration and accommodating the uncertainty often found among introductory users.  The assertion that the flexibility of this electronic key increases students' speed, accuracy and confidence in identification of insects is evaluated by comparison of the performance of students using the two approaches (the multi-access key versus dichotomous keys),  and involves diverse courses with students ranging from non-science majors to those choosing entomology as a specialization.  The results provide important information for educators considering the incorporation of biodiversity modules in their laboratory or field course curricula.  This project serves as a model for the development of electronic keys for other taxa.  The internet availability of this easy-to-use professionally-produced identification tool should be of value to educators, extension agents, researchers and the average citizen, and fosters a greater interest in taxonomy, a more intimate awareness of the environment and the diversity of organisms found there, and an enhancement in scientific literacy.",
