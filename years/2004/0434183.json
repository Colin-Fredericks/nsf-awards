 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a U.S.-Russian workshop on the plate tectonic evolution of northeast Russia.\r\nIt will bring together key research scientists from Russia and the U.S. with an interest in investigating the plate tectonic evolution of the North Pacific and the Arctic, with focus on the regional geology and geophysics of NE Russia.  The co-organizers of the workshop are Dr. Elizabeth Miller from Stanford University and Dr. Alexander Khanchuk from the Far East Geological Institute in Vladivostok, Russia.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this workshop is to frame a long-term scientific plan and to outline potential collaborative projects that utilize existing expertise, databases, laboratories and institutional capabilities.  NE Russia represents the biggest gap in knowledge of the geologic and tectonic history of the Arctic and North Pacific margins.  Filling this knowledge gap is essential for improving understanding of the U.S. portions of these margins as well.   This workshop is also an exceptional opportunity for junior U.S. scientists and students to meet and share knowledge with experts on the vast and remote region of NE Russia.\r\n\r\nThis workshop fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading experts in the U.S. and Russia to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest and competence on the basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutuality of benefit.",
