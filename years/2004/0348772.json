 "awd_abstract_narration": "The program goal is to develop innovations in energy-efficient lighting systems through advanced modeling, control algorithm research, and hardware realization that will bring down technology barriers and enable significant reduction in the environmental and economic impacts of lighting systems. The program combines five highly integrated components, including three core research legs, an educational integration plan, and international and industry collaboration. The research core includes (1) theoretical analysis and computer modeling of the complex behavior and interaction between high-efficiency lamps and driving electronics, (2) control algorithm analysis and research based on a new digital system architecture, and (3) realization of an Experimental Research Platform based on custom integrated circuit (IC) designs required for validation and experimentation of modeling and control algorithm results. The integrated educational plan results in the development of the first EE curriculum in the U.S. dedicated to Energy-Efficient Lighting Systems. The program ties the core research to three courses that are cross-listed for both undergraduate and graduate students, allowing students to gain an early appreciation for theoretical modeling and control in lighting and practical hands-on laboratory and IC design experience based on the Experimental Research Platform. The program aims to enable and instigate wide-spread development and use of energy-efficient lighting systems, resulting in a significant reduction in the emission of green house and poisonous gases into the environment, reduced demands on non-renewable energy sources, and decreased operating costs in large commercial, industrial, and retail buildings.",
