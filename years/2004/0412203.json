 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will develop robust, accurate, and cost-effective\r\nmethods for simulating the dynamics of suspensions of flexible fibers\r\nin a Stokesian fluid.  Flexible fibers make up the\r\nmicro-structure of suspensions that show strongly non-Newtonian bulk\r\nbehavior, such as elasticity, shear-thinning, and normal stresses\r\ndifferences in shear flows.  By taking a nonstandard approach to this\r\nproblem, and designing a numerical algorithm based on a nonlocal\r\nslender-body approximation to hydrodynamical interactions, it is\r\npossible to simulate problems not feasible with standard methods.  As\r\nthis numerical method has a firm mathematical foundation, method\r\ndesign can be approached as a numerical analysis problem, carefully\r\ntreating issues of accuracy and stability in algorithm design.\r\nTechnical obstacles to be addressed are the accurate inclusion of\r\nlubrication forces when filaments approach each other, and the\r\ndevelopment and application of fast summation strategies for\r\nevalluating filament-filament interactions.  The investigators will\r\nalso develop especially efficient methods for the special case of\r\nrigid filaments.  They will apply these methods to a set of current\r\ntheoretical issues, such as the development of normal stress\r\ndifferences in flexible fiber suspensions, the effect on fluid mixing\r\nof storing and releasing elastic stress in the fluidic microstructure,\r\nand the large-scale dynamics of rod-like self-locomoting elements (as\r\narises in modeling bacterial baths)\r\n\r\nThe dynamics of microscopic flexible fibers immersed in a fluid are\r\nessential to understanding many current problems arising in biology,\r\nengineering, and physics.  Examples range from manufacturing processes\r\nin the pulp and paper industries to new proposed methods for mixing\r\nfluids in small devices to the locomotion of micro-organisms.  These\r\nare all complicated systems whose dynamics are not well understood, in\r\npart because the large-scale dynamics of the flow can depend on the\r\ndetailed nonlinear dynamics of the microscopic fibers.  To help\r\nincrease our understanding of such problems, the investigators are\r\ndeveloping efficient and accurate methods for numerically simulating\r\nthe dynamics of such systems with many interacting fibers.  They will\r\napply these methods to a set of current applications, drawn from the\r\nbasic physics of fluids, engineering, and biology.\r\n",
