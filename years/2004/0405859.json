The\r\nPI will study the geometry of the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow\r\nconjecture by looking at the conjectural picture of a Calabi-Yau\r\nthreefold near the large complex structure limit, where the\r\nspecial Lagrangian torus fibration collapses.  The resulting\r\nmanifold is a real integer affine manifold with singularities.\r\nThe first project will produce a real Monge-Ampere metric on an\r\nopen ball outside a Y-shaped singular locus, then study its\r\nmonodromy.  A knowledge of this region is essential to gaining a\r\nglobal understanding of the Calabi-Yau, including the role of\r\ndisc instanton corrections.  Related projects are to study the\r\ngeometry of flat or Ricci-flat torus fibrations in Ricci-flat\r\nmanifolds in general, and to study the counting problem of\r\nspecial Lagrangian and other calibrated submanifolds by varying\r\nthe metric away from the Ricci flat one.  The final project is\r\ninvestigate integrable hierarchies underlying the topological\r\nvertex.\r\n\r\nThe project studies the mathematics behind the physical\r\nphenomenon of mirror symmetry.  Mirror symmetry is when two\r\ndifferent physical theories give rise to the same predictions\r\nabout nature.  Mathematically, there are deep connections behind\r\nthe equivalence, and this project looks at the geometry of the\r\nequivalence.  Understanding the geometry of mirror symmetry will\r\nlead to a broader comprehension of the structure of mathematics,\r\nand conceivably physics.  For instance, mirror symmetry aids in\r\nthe calculation of topological field theories, which have been\r\nshown to have computational relevance to the conventional gauge\r\ntheories that underly particle physics.  At a more basic,\r\nmathematical level, understanding the geometry of mirror symmetry\r\ncan lead to a concrete description of the special structures\r\nconjectured by Calabi to exist in 1957 and proved to exist by Yau\r\nin 1979.  Still, we know very little about this important aspect\r\nof geometry.  The rich interplay of mathematics and physics has\r\nmuch to teach us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
