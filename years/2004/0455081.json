 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin System and Spelman College will use this SGER award for a series of planning events to develop international networks of scientists to advance knowledge on the interactions of science and social transformation. The expertise of social and behavioral scientist in the United States and sub-Saharan Africa will be pooled to focus on social transformation as mediated through human resource development.  The activities will ultimately impact the inclusion of groups now underrepresented in science and technology.  \r\n\r\nNetworks of scholars in the United States, South Africa, Ghana, and Uganda will examine links between policies on the advancement of the sciences and their impact in institutions of higher education.  Specific institutions have been identified as partners in this research, including universities as well as national and international organizations.   Planning meetings will be used to create faculty networks with the goal of further communication, exchange of ideas, and development of research priorities.  This will set the stage for a second phase focusing on transforming higher education as an instrument of social change leading to greater participation in higher education.",
