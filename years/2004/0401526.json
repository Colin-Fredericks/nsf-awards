 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nuclear beta decay was important in motivating the Standard Model, and\r\nit continues to be of importance in searches for physics beyond the\r\nStandard Model.  The simplest system for studying beta decay is the\r\nneutron, where there is a long history of increasingly accurate\r\nmeasurements of the parameters that characterize the decay.  By\r\nmeasuring the neutron's lifetime (from the Ft value) and the neutron's\r\nbeta asymmetry A, one has enough information to independently determine\r\nthe weak vector and axial-vector couplings, GV  and GA. Although recent\r\naccurate measurements of the neutron lifetime are in good agreement\r\nwith each other, the same cannot be said for measurements of the\r\nneutron's beta asymmetry A.  Since 1985, there have been four accurate\r\n(combined statistical and systematic uncertainty of about 1% each)\r\nmeasurements of A.  Unfortunately, the agreement between these four A\r\nmeasurements is poor.\r\n\r\nAn approved Los Alamos experiment will again measure the A coefficient,\r\nthis time utilizing Ultra-Cold Neutrons, dramatically reducing\r\nsystematic errors otherwise present due to beam-induced backgrounds and\r\nincomplete polarization.  The key features are 1) the ability to port\r\nthe neutrons to a significant distance away from their production site\r\n(using total external reflection), 2) vetoing events when the beam\r\npulse is on target (capitalizing on the pulsed production method), and\r\n3) obtain 100% polarization using an axial magnetic field (where\r\nneutrons of the wrong spin do not have enough kinetic energy to\r\novercome the mu.B potential).\r\n\r\nOur group at Virginia Tech has responsibility for UCN transport for the\r\nLos Alamos experiment, the fast DAQ, and experimental coordination.\r\nThe critical component of this system addressed by this proposal is the\r\ncoating for transporting polarized neutrons.  We have shown\r\npulsed-laser-deposition of diamond films is suitable.  At Virginia\r\nTech, an existing excimer laser has been re-commissioned to produce\r\nsuitable films.  A system for coating both the guide tubes and central\r\ndecay tube of the spectrometer has been developed.  The successful\r\ncampaign to make suitably coated guides for polarized UCNs has an\r\nimpact, not just to this experiment, but to planned future experiments\r\nas well.\r\n",
