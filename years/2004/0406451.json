An Agency representative will introduce a Speaker on a particular topic of interest to the Metabolic Engineering Working Group.  Five Speakers are scheduled to discuss the Metabolic Engineering associated with Plant Cells, Animal and Insect Cells, Microbial Cells, Health Science and Computational Biology.  In addition, there is to be a Keynote Speaker.    Continued research efforts in these areas will lead to important information that will enable the realization of the full potential of Metabolic Engineering within Agriculture, Environmental Biotechnology, Energy Development, Marine Biotechnology, Medicine, and beyond.  \r\n\r\nThe Workshop is scheduled to be held at the National Science Foundation (NSF) on February 6, 2004.   Information generated at this Workshop may be useful for planning purposes for MEWG and the Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology (BEB) Program in the Bioengineering and Environmental Systems (BES) Division of NSF.  Information from this Workshop will be distilled into a report for NSF and the MEWG.  \r\n",
