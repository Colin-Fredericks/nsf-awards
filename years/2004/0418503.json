 "awd_abstract_narration": "All  upper  chambers  possess  constitutional  standing,  suggesting  that  they  should  have  influence  within the legislative process. The literature on parliaments until recently has disregarded the role  of  upper  chambers  in  parliamentary  democracies  as  practically  non-existent.  These  arguments  have centered on both the composition and the institutional weakness of the upper chamber vis-a- vis the lower chamber. Recent work in the area of formal modeling has suggested, however, that  policy  outcomes  are  different  under  bicameral  institutions  than  under  unicameral  institutions,  despite the variations in bicameral institutional arrangements. Yet the circumstances under which  upper  chambers  use  their  authority,  and  its  ultimate  effect  on  policy  outcomes  remains  understudied, as current research either, does not test their models against the empirical record, or  relies  primarily  on  one  case.  This  project  expands  on  current  research  by  examining  not  only  institutional factors which may explain upper house assertion in the legislative process, but also  the  impact  of  party  factors  (such  as  party  discipline)  and  policy  preferences  of  the  median  legislator in the upper chamber in four parliamentary democracies (Belgium, Ireland, Germany,  and the United Kingdom). NSF support will be used to travel to each capital for one month to  access  parliamentary  debate  records,  archival  information,  and  interviews  where  necessary.  Investigation based on these sources is essential to understanding the circumstances under which  upper chambers use their authority to intervene in the policy making process.    \r\nThe presence of an upper chamber has been hypothesized to affect not only policy outcomes in  stable democracies, but has also been a significant area of debate within developing democracies  and the literature on how deeply divided societies should be governed. In addition to their effect  on  policy  outcomes,  it  has  been  noted  that  even  those  upper  chambers  that  are  viewed  as  institutionally  weak,  have  recently  become  more  assertive  in  dealing  with  governments  in  the  lower house. In many cases, this increase in upper chamber assertion has required governments to  amend or drop bills altogether, which suggests that blanket rejections of upper house influence  are misleading. This project expands on current research in comparative parliamentary studies to  examine how institutional effects can shape the costs of overriding the upper chamber, as well as  examine the role of party discipline and policy preferences of the upper chamber in determining  when to use institutional authority strategically to obtain their desired outcome. Existing data and  newly collected and operationalized data will be used in this analysis.  \r\n Broader Impact  NSF  funding  for  this  research  project  will  provide  the  co-PI  the  resources  to  collect  and  code  relevant  data  on  upper  chamber  assertion  within  the  legislative  process  in  a  more  systematic  manner and for a wider range of cases than is currently offered by the literature. Data collected by  this project will be made publicly available for academic, research, and noncommercial purposes,  and will be of useful for scholarship in the area of comparative legislative studies, as well as the  affects  of  bicameral  institutional  structures  on  parliamentary  systems,  and  institutional  engineering in developing democracies.   \r\n",
