 "awd_abstract_narration": "SST: CAD Tools and Verification for Resonator-Based Sensor Technology\r\n\r\nA major effort in sensing technology centers about the miniaturization of sensing elements.\r\nMuch investment is being expended upon the development of sensing systems that can be incorpo-rated\r\ninto autonomous micro-electrical-mechanical systems (MEMS) for widespread wireless sensing\r\nneeds ranging from monitoring buildings and bridges for safety, to electronic noses for detecting\r\natmospheric chemical hazards across wide geographic areas, to electronic ears for monitoring com-munication\r\nchannels just to name a few. One key to the successful deployment of such systems\r\nis overcoming the energy needs of sensor nodes. Note that sensors need power not only to sense\r\nbut also to communicate. An attractive technology for dealing with many of these issues is bulk-acoustic\r\nwave resonators (BAWRs); at the MEMS scale of a few microns these devices operate in\r\nthe GHz range (cell phone frequencies). BAWRs can be used as high quality frequency references\r\nin chemical sensors, elements of signal processing filter networks, and as elements of wireless com-munication\r\nsystems all at very low power compared to alternate technologies. Much of the promise\r\nof such devices has been seen in proof-of-concept experiments that have recently been published.\r\nHowever, a careful reading of these publications shows that while the general operating principles\r\nof BAWRs are known, there is a distinct lack of accuracy to which resonant-based MEMS sensor\r\ndesigners understand expected system behavior. This proposal intends to help rectify this defi-ciency\r\nand to promote more rapid development of successful BAWR devices by developing freely\r\navailable computer aided design (CAD) tools.\r\nThis interdisciplinary team of researchers intends to not only develop a CAD tool but to also\r\nconduct experiments to verify its accuracy. Their CAD software is designed to accurately predict\r\nresonator quality degradation from thermoelastic damping, intrinsic material losses, and anchor\r\n(or clamping) losses. They will tackle the problem in a new way for the MEMS community by\r\nlooking directly to the governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for the resonator behavior\r\nand then abstracting small, accurate, and fast models for design level computations using advanced\r\nKrylov model reduction methods. Novel aspects in their approach include a modeling system that\r\nwill automatically separate different damping effects from each other and make possible new virtual\r\nexperiments for the creation of heretofore unknown BAWRs. Key to this last point is their proposal\r\nto develop an optimization module for the CAD tool that will allow for the optimization of targeted\r\nperformance parameters, such as transfer functions, that are needed for higher level sensor node\r\ndesign. Integral to the proposed work will be the fabrication of poly- and single-crystal BAWRs\r\nthat will test the models, help refine them, and test new concepts in coupled resonator designs.\r\nThe team make-up includes experts in material modeling, scientific computing, and MEMS design\r\nand fabrication. They intend to build upon their past successes in creating new MEMS devices\r\nand in creating and disseminating MEMS design software.\r\nThe scientific questions to be addressed in this proposal are of a critical importance to the\r\ncommunity. But beyond these merits, it is noted that the proposal will have the broader impact\r\nof developing the community's research infrastructure as the software to be developed will be dis-tributed\r\nfreely. On the human resource side the proposers will fill a broader objective by training\r\nstudents in an highly interdisciplinary field by combining training in semi-conductor engineering\r\nwith mechanical modeling and scientific computing. Such graduates are sorely needed in the com-munity.\r\nThe proposers additionally plan to recruit from the successful Summer Undergraduate\r\nProgram in Engineering Research at Berkeley (SUPERB). This program aims to reach out to\r\nunder-represented groups in engineering and provide them with a high quality research experience\r\nand encourage them to aspire to graduate degrees. The PIs have successfully participated in this\r\nprogram in the past.",
