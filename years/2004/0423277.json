They plan to include an international collaboration component in the scope of the NSF funded project: ITR- Forward Error Correction Codes and Protocols for Next-Generation Optical Networks (NSF Grant ANI-0325979). The goal of this project is to develop a framework for joint error control/bandwidth management in optical networks.  This framework is aimed at dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) fiber-optic systems, which have become the predominant transport technology for local, metropolitan, and wide area networks.  In DWDM the quality of the optical signal is impacted by various channel nonlinearities and spontaneous emission noise that require tailored forward error correction (FEC) techniques. The problem is further exacerbated by the heterogeneity of the network in the form of variable transmission speeds for different wavelength channels and varying switching capabilities at different nodes within the same network.  The approach is based on integrating innovative FEC schemes into the design of adaptive network strategies. Professor Banat brings to the project his expertise on FEC and modulation techniques for optical channels.  He has previously worked on phase-noise characterization in optical channels and on designing appropriate FEC codes for mitigating the impact of such noise.  He has also conducted research on optical beat interference (OBI) reduction techniques in SCM/WDMA networks using pseudorandom optical frequency hopping.  This expertise will be useful in characterizing other forms of nonlinearities (e.g., group velocity dispersion, polarization mode dispersion, etc.) and designing BIBD codes for the optical channel.  Furthermore, Professor Banat expertise on spread spectrum schemes for optical channels (e.g., optical frequency hopping) will be beneficial in the current research when investigating appropriate switching techniques in a network with heterogeneous nodes.  The research on networking management techniques will be conducted by Krunz, whose main expertise lies in the area of networking. \r\n\r\nScope and broader impacts:  The proposed project will serve as a vehicle for the training of graduate students at the University of Arizona (UA) and JUST through participation in research with the visiting scientists. The PI has previously recruited several outstanding M.S. graduates from JUST, who are currently pursuing their Ph.D. work at UA under his supervision.  Software developed under the support of this project will be made available to the research community at large.  The topics covered in the project will be integrated into the curricula of graduate courses at UA and JUST. \r\n",
