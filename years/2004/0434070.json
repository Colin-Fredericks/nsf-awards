 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Appalachian College Association (ACA) serves 34 colleges and universities, enrolling over 38,000 students, in central Appalachia by facilitating collaboration among the schools to enhance their programs.  This ACA project is providing 54 one-year scholarships and other support to encourage juniors, seniors and graduates with majors in science, technology, engineering and mathematics to teach in high-need middle and high schools in underserved areas, particularly central Appalachia.  ACA schools provide small classes, a high level of faculty/student interaction and individualized attention for their students.  When possible, Noyce Scholars are paired at their home institutions or at nearby participating ACA schools so that the mutual support relationship can be developed and utilized effectively.  NSF Noyce Scholars meet annually, and are encouraged to share experiences over a web site.  Outstanding programs are presented at the annual ACA Summit.  The ACA hosts an annual Weekend Retreat for new teachers in their induction years.  The program also provides mentors drawn from a pool of identified outstanding teachers and professionals working in STEM fields, to assist the new teachers in their adjustment to the demands of teaching assignments in high-need schools where there may be limited support for new faculty and limited exposure to practicing STEM professionals.",
