 "awd_abstract_narration": "Today's power conversion circuits are based on the two conventional topologies: voltage-source and current-source, a \"two-leg\" structure supporting all existing power conversion circuits.  The conventional voltage-source (V-source) and current-source (I-source) converters have their theoretical limitations that prevent economical and efficient solutions to many applications.  For example, the V-source inverter is a buck converter that cannot produce an output voltage greater than the source voltage.  This limitation often requires an additional dc-dc boost converter for many applications such as batteries, photovoltaic, and fuel cells, which makes the power conversion have much lower efficiency, larger size, and higher cost.\r\n\tIn this project, we investigate a new type of power conversion circuits, an impedance-source (Z-source) power converter that was proposed two years ago with the intent to overcome the problems associated with the conventional V- and I-source converters.\r\nThis research project is to extend and apply the Z-source topology to the entire circuit spectrum (categories) of power electronics, including dc-to-ac, ac-to-dc, ac-to-ac, and dc-to-dc power conversion and to develop their control theory.  With the successful extension and application of the Z-source concept to all power conversion categories, a \"third leg\" will be established.  This \"third leg\" will change the entire spectrum of power electronics circuits and provide a third option to optimize performance, maximize efficiency, and minimize cost and size.\r\n",
