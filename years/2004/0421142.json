 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research addresses a fundamental problem affecting all underground lifelines, namely the effects of \r\nlarge  differential  ground  deformation  on  buried  pipeline  and  conduit  performance.    The  research  will \r\nproduce  a  seminal  outcome  through  state-of-the-art  modeling  and  quantification  of  earthquake-induced \r\nground movement effects on lifelines. It also will improve the design and construction of lifelines affected \r\nby  landslides,  mining,  extraction  of  subsurface  fluids,  and  underground  construction.  The  research \r\ndeliverables include, as a minimum: 1) systematic assessment of lifeline performance under permanent \r\nground deformation,  2)  quantification  of  serviceability  and  ultimate  limit  states  for  critical  lifelines,  3) \r\ndesign guidelines, 4) experimental databases for benchmarking future numerical models and guiding the \r\nevolution  of  numerical  simulations  for  soil-structure  interaction,  and  5)  validation  and  guidance  for \r\nadvanced materials as well as sensor and robotics deployment in underground conduits. \r\n \r\nThe research will be performed through physical modeling using the Cornell Large Displacement Soil-\r\nStructure Interaction Facility for Lifeline Systems and the Rensselaer 150 g-ton Geotechnical Centrifuge \r\nin combination with advanced computational simulation.  The 4-year program is organized according to a \r\nmatrix  management  approach  in  which  lifeline  response  to  a  comprehensive  suite  of  ground  rupture \r\npatterns is systematically investigated and checked through large-scale experiments, centrifuge tests, and \r\nnumerical simulation. \r\n \r\nTechnical Merits:  The research team at Cornell and Rensselaer has extensive experience in the design, \r\nsiting,  and  construction  of  underground  lifelines,  as  well  as  laboratory  and  field  testing  of \r\npipelines/conduits.    They  have  worked  extensively  together  and  have  earned  a  strong  national  and \r\ninternational  reputation  for  their  contributions  to  lifeline,  geotechnical,  and  structural  engineering.  \r\nMoreover, they will follow a meticulous and systematic plan for the research that is thoroughly integrated \r\nand managed.  They will use world-class NEES facilities that were constructed specifically for this type \r\nof  investigation.    Research  investments  through  the  proposed  project  will  be  leveraged  into  improved \r\npractices for water, electric power, gas and liquid fuel, telecommunication, transportation, and wastewater \r\nconveyance lifelines representing hundreds of thousands of km of US facilities critical for the delivery of \r\ncommunity resources and services. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts:  The proposed project addresses safety and reliability of critical infrastructure while \r\nalso creating an innovative outreach program with the Sciencenter of Ithaca, NY.  The project team will \r\ndevelop a 300-SF museum exhibition on earthquake engineering and will explain how engineers at NEES \r\nsites study earthquake effects using networked experimental facilities.  An interactive shake table that can \r\nbe controlled by anyone on the Internet will allow museum visitors, school classes, and home users to \r\nparticipate in earthquake engineering experiments, reaching an estimated 600,000 individuals over four \r\nyears.  The  project  will  model  a  process  for  how  other  NEES  sites  can  link  with  400  science  centers \r\nthroughout the U.S. \r\n \r\nThe project involves substantial collaboration with industry, including ADS, Inc., Corning, Inc., Exxon \r\nMobil, Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, Phillips Driscopipe, Inc., Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd., and \r\nULC  Robotics,  Inc.    Hence,  the  research  results  will  be  guided  by  industry  for  maximum  impact  in \r\npractice,  continuing  education  of  the  U.S.  work  force,  and  nationwide  dissemination  in  infrastructure \r\nprojects. \r\n \r\nThe  project  will  receive  assistance  from  Cornell  in  supporting  women  and  minority  summer  research \r\nexperiences  for  undergraduates,  and  will  benefit  from  a  Sciencenter  program  that  will support  teenage \r\nmuseum guides from underserved communities.  Additional undergraduate support will be sought through \r\nthe NSF REU program, graduate students will be supported, and research results will be integrated into \r\ncourses taught by the PIs and their colleagues at Cornell, Rensselaer, and other institutions. \r\n",
