Garvan\r\nCO-PI(s): Miklos Bona\r\nNeil White\r\nRichard Crew\r\nInstitution: University of Florida\r\n\r\nABSTRACT             \r\n\r\n    The 2004-2005 Special Year at the Department of Mathematics, University\r\nof Florida is in Number Theory and Combinatorics and features two\r\nparallel programs.  The Number Theory part of Special Year 2004-05 \r\nwill be highlighted by two conferences: (i) An International Conference \r\non Additive Number Theory in November 2004, and (ii) An International \r\nConference on Arithmetic Geometry in February 2005. The highlight of \r\nthe Combinatorics part of the Special Year Program will be (iii) A \r\nWorkshop on Automated Deduction in Geometry in September 2004, and \r\n(iv) The Third International Conference on Pattern Avoiding\r\nPermutations in March 2005. There are plans to publish the refereed\r\nproceedings of these conferences. Topics for these conferences have \r\nbeen chosen from areas of our research strengths but involve broader \r\nthemes. The conferences will be augmented by lectures throughout \r\nthe year on the latest trends in research by eminent visiting \r\nmathematicians, as well as History Lectures which should appeal \r\nto students.  The Additive Number Theory Conference will involve\r\nthree main themes:   partitions and q-series; Goldbach, Waring type problems, \r\nand sieves; and basis and density questions. The Arithmetic Geometry \r\nConference will be devoted to p-adic methods in arithmetic and algebraic \r\ngeometry.  Automated Deduction in Geometry Workshop will be a forum to \r\nexchange ideas and views, to present research results and progress, \r\nand to demonstrate software tools on the intersection between geometry \r\nand automated deduction.  The Conference on Pattern Avoiding Permutations \r\nis on the exact and asymptotic enumeration and structural analysis, \r\nof permutations with subsequence conditions. This area is connected \r\nto the theory of Young tableaux, labeled trees, partially ordered sets, \r\nand planar maps, as well as sorting and searching.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Special Year Program in Number Theory and Combinatorics  \r\nwill be of interest even to researchers outside of mathematics and \r\ntherefore will strengthen ties with other disciplines. Number Theory is \r\nthe study of the properties of whole numbers and is the oldest branch \r\nof mathematics.  Topics such as partitions, elliptic curves, and \r\ncryptography, covered by our conferences in number theory will be \r\nof interest to physicists and those in computer science.  Combinatorics is \r\nthe study of discrete collections of objects, and how they can be arranged\r\nand counted efficiently.  The areas covered by the conferences in \r\ncombinatorics will be of appeal to computer and engineering sciences. \r\nNumber Theory and Combinatorics are ideally suited to attract the attention of \r\nnon-experts and students to significant developments in mathematics. \r\nThus the History Lectures in these areas will inform graduate and \r\nundergraduate students as to how fundamental ideas and concepts \r\ndeveloped, and this in turn will help in attracting talented \r\nstudents to take to more advanced study in mathematics.     \r\n",
