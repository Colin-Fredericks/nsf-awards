 "awd_abstract_narration": "The UC Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (UC AGEP) is uniquely poised to \r\nincrease the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students who enter the professoriate in \r\nscience, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).  In Phase II of UC AGEP, the broader \r\nimpact of this program will be to increase the number of URM STEM students earning PhDs and \r\nbecoming optimally prepared for the professoriate.  Its intellectual merit lies in its production of new \r\nmodel programs for recruiting, retaining, and graduating URM STEM PhDs and assisting with \r\npostdoctoral placements.  \r\n \r\nThe UC system currently produces approximately 10% of the nation.s URM PhDs in the Life Sciences, \r\nEngineering and Computer Sciences, Physical Sciences, and Mathematics.  In Phase I of its AGEP \r\nprogram, UC AGEP increased URM new STEM enrollment both in real numbers and as a percent of \r\ntotal enrollment. To sustain this gain and increase representation of URMs in the professoriate, UC \r\nAGEP Phase II will expand its recruitment and admission efforts while addressing key later components \r\nfrom retention through postdoctoral placements.  Specifically, UC AGEP II will implement a six-step \r\nprogram designed to:  \r\n \r\n1.  Increase the number of URM STEM students aware of and prepared for graduate study through \r\ndissemination of information about UC AGEP activities and summer enrichment opportunities \r\nfor undergraduates.  \r\n \r\n2.  Increase the number of URM students who apply to UC campuses and who are considered for \r\nadmission to the University through pre-application events, partnerships with minority serving \r\ninstitutions (MSIs) such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), partnerships \r\nwith California State Universities and summer programs for masters students. \r\n \r\n3.  Increase both the number of URM students who are admitted, and the number who choose to \r\naccept offers through:  1) targeting interactions and assistance to admission committees; 2) \r\nincreasing opportunities for campus visits; 3) increasing communication with admitted students; \r\nand 4) providing summer enrichment opportunities for newly admitted students. \r\n \r\n4.  Impact the early academic experience of URM graduate students and improve their retention by \r\ncreating community networks, improving faculty mentoring, and enhancing students. skills for \r\ncoping with academic hurdles such as the qualifying exam. \r\n \r\n5.  Support continuing URM graduate students through programs that improve their professional \r\nand academic skills, and prepare them for postdoctoral positions and the academic job market.   \r\n \r\n6.  Create new models for increasing URM access to and participation in postdoctoral scholar \r\npositions, thereby ensuring their competitiveness for academic positions. \r\n \r\nUC AGEP Phase II expects project outcomes to include increased URM awareness of UC STEM fields, \r\nbetter preparation of applicants, increased URM numbers (and percentages) for application and \r\nmatriculation, increased retention, a decreased time to degree, and better access to postdoctoral positions. \r\nThus, over the next five years, UC AGEP II should result in a significant increase in URM PhDs who \r\ngraduate from UC programs and enter the professoriate.  Also, by comparison of best practices, the UC \r\nAGEP infrastructure will foster the building of networks and models for diversity interventions that will \r\npersist after the grant period ends.",
