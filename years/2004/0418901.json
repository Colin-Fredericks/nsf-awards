 "awd_abstract_narration": "The terminal Proterozoic Ediacaran biota remains one of the great controversies in\r\nmodern paleontology. Its temporal position, preceding the so-called Cambrian explosion,\r\nsuggests that it should provide key information on the early evolution of animals. Studies of the\r\nEdiacaran biota have traditionally focussed on the description and interpretation of individual\r\ntaxa and more recently on the stratigraphic distribution and paleogeography. A major\r\nshortcoming in the study of the Ediacaran biota is the paucity of studies of the community\r\nstructure and other aspects of synecology. There is no a priori reason why late Proterozoic\r\nassemblages should not be examined by the same means as Phanerozoic communities.\r\nParticularly as models for the preservation of Ediacaran fossils (Gehling 1999) predict that they\r\npotentially should yield census communities. The proposed research project will be the first\r\ndetailed systematic field analysis of a high-diversity Ediacaran assemblage (including all body\r\nand trace fossils, problematic structures and inorganic surfacesls) by the study of selected\r\nlocalities in South Australia in which large sequential bedding planes (over hundreds of square\r\nmeters) can be excavated.\r\nThe fieldwork protocol involves excavation and re-assembly of beds that have been\r\ncarefully logged in stratigraphic succession. These bedding-planes will be examined in detail and\r\nall body and trace fossils and sedimentary structures recorded and categorized with respect to\r\nproperties and nature of preservation. The distribution of fossils is then analysed by standard\r\nstatistical methods. Preliminary examination suggests that there is an unexpected high difference\r\nin fossils and the nature of bedding planes between beds in immediate stratigraphic succession.\r\nAn important aim of the project is to explain these observations; to what extent do these\r\ndifferences represent preservational biases or complex communities?\r\nAn important part of this project is to document in detail trace fossils as well as the\r\nnumerous problematic structures of both inorganic and organic origin. Previously there has been\r\nno detailed examination of the distribution of late Proterozoic trace fossils with respect to body\r\nfossils and the nature of the beds on which the traces occur. The record of late Proterozoic trace\r\nfossils is problematic because of numerous misidentifications with problematic structures. These\r\nproblematic structures have largely been ignored in studies focussed on discrete body fossils, but\r\nthey hold important information on the nature of these communities. It is only by examination of\r\nlarge bedding plane surfaces that the nature of these objects can be understood and we can\r\nultimately understand the taphonomic overprint on Ediacaran assemblages and thus, unravel\r\nEdiacaran ecology.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nEdiacaran assemblages are the oldest diverse macroscopic fossil assemblages on Earth.\r\nAs such, they are of considerable interest to a wide range of geologists and biologists. Bedding\r\nplanes that will be excavated for this study will be reassembled in a manner that allows for the\r\ndevelopment of a site for students and other interested parties to visit (as previously arranged\r\nwith the landowner).\r\nThis project is ideally suited for undergraduate participation and monies are budgeted for\r\n2 undergraduates to travel to Australia and work in the field. Local Australians will also be\r\ninvolved with the excavation and related activities. In this way, the significance of this deposit\r\nand others like it can be conveyed. This project will develop and protect a world class fossil\r\nlocality the full potential of which has remained untapped.",
