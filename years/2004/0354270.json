Corlette\r\n\r\nThis project will support activities of the geometry/topology\r\ngroup at the University of Chicago which have an impact on the\r\ntraining of graduate students.  This group currently consists of\r\nsix senior faculty, thirteen junior faculty and about thirty\r\ngraduate students.  The research interests of members of the\r\ngroup span a wide array of topics in geometry and topology,\r\nincluding complex differential geometry, rigidity and locally\r\nsymmetric spaces, connections of ergodic theory with discrete\r\ngroups and number theory, geometric group theory, 3-manifold\r\ntopology, Teichmuller theory, geometric topology of\r\nhigh-dimensional manifolds, the moduli space of Riemannian\r\nmetrics, complex dynamics, symplectic topology and homotopy\r\ntheory.  The activities of the group include active research\r\nseminars in geometry/topology and algebraic topology, several\r\nstudent seminars and a visitors program, all of which are\r\ndirectly relevant to the education of graduate students.  These\r\nactivities, in combination with the general structure of the\r\ngraduate program in the department, provide ideal conditions for\r\nstudents to gain exposure to a broad range of current research\r\nwhile pursuing their own specific research projects.\r\n\r\nGeometry and topology are fundamental parts of mathematics which\r\nare currently experiencing rapid development, with many new ideas\r\nand lines of investigation being pursued.  Many of these\r\ndevelopments are internal to the subject, while others arise, at\r\nleast in part, from contact with fields such as physics and\r\ncomputer science.  It is particularly exciting to be a student in\r\na field undergoing this kind of change, but it is at the same\r\ntime a challenge to orient oneself when the landscape is rapidly\r\nchanging.  This project will enhance the ability of doctoral\r\nstudents at the University of Chicago to learn about and do\r\nresearch in these areas, thus helping to train the next\r\ngeneration of researchers in geometry and topology.  In addition\r\nto providing direct support for graduate students as they do\r\nresearch, the project will also provide support for graduate\r\nstudents to travel to conferences and the bring visitors to the\r\nUniversity for seminar talks and collaboration.  All of this is\r\nintended to expose graduate students to the frontlines of\r\nresearch as effectively as possible.\r\n",
