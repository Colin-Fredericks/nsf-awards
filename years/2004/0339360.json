 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project addresses the feasibility of designing\r\nand building virtual classroom software tools for cheminformatics training in both academic and\r\nbusiness settings. Mesa Analytics & Computing, LLC has developed a commercial, integrated\r\nsuite of the leading edge cheminformatics software tools in the cheminformatics areas mentioned\r\nabove. However, these tools, containing new and original research by Mesa, are for use in large\r\nscale research and industrial applications, where the users already have experience in\r\ncheminformatics software. The research goals of this project are to show that virtual classroom\r\nsoftware tools will be effective, comprehensive, and low cost products for training in both\r\nacademic and industry settings. This project will assess the portability and scalability of\r\nsoftware tools for interactive distance learning in chemical information topics, such as finding\r\nstructural commonalities in diverse compound sets, generation and use of structural compound\r\ndescriptors, similarity searching and clustering, and compound diversity analysis for compound\r\nacquisition. The project will produce a report outlining the design of the training software tools,\r\nincluding the graphical user interface and virtual classroom integration, from the underlying\r\nresearch and commercial tools.\r\n\r\nAt present there are no specific software tools for chemical information training in the U.S.,\r\nthough there are several nascent chemometrics and chemical information university departments\r\nand curricula. A number of commercial software products used in the pharmaceutical and\r\nbiotechnology industry are either too expensive or of limited utility for training in either\r\nacademic or business settings. Converting Mesa's tools into training tools for concept learning\r\nwill serve the dual purpose in providing cheminformatics training tools for both academia and\r\nindustry. By employing distance learning through a web delivery system, the training software\r\nwill provide an effective, low cost solution for academic institutions, whether they are offering a\r\nsingle course to rural students in a remote setting, or an entire program in cheminformatics and a\r\nmajor urban university. In addition, such training tools will be very useful in industry settings\r\nwith local area networks, where in a multidiscipline setting individuals need to receive training\r\non the concepts employed by industrial chemoinformatics software--an integral part of the drug\r\ndiscovery process for pharmaceutical and biotech industries.\r\nKey words: cheminformatics, chemometrics, clustering, compound diversity analysis for\r\ncompound acquisition, distance learning, similarity searching, structural commonalities in\r\ndiverse compound sets, structural compound descriptors, virtual classroom.\r\nSubtopic: B.
