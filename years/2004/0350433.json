 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal seeks to establish a forum to synthesize computational\r\nTechniques in engineering mechanics, from the continuum to micro- to nano- level,that play an essential role in all branches of emerging technologies. The goal is to stimulate more accurate evaluation and more efficient design of numerical experimentation. In particular, to account for scale effects, suitable topics have been selected to replace heuristic schemes and associated computational strategies by fundamental formulations based on the underlying physics of the problem. Subtle secondary effects, which are currently assessed by\r\nSubjective procedures, constitute the central theme of the workshop.  The US engineering mechanics researchers  have been assessing the needs of their colleagues working on emerging technologies --- micro- and nano-mechanics research in a variety of fields including biomedical engineering. They seek active collaboration with the foreign participants to submit proposals for government and private funding. Such combined team efforts during workshops invariably lead to designing optimized algorithms  appropriate for developing\r\nResearch projects across a wide field of engineering science.\r\n\r\n",
