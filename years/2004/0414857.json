 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to develop effective techniques for visualizing and interactively exploring large relational data. The project has three integrated technical components: (1) data visualization, which focuses on extending 3D grand tour and volume rendering techniques to render high dimensional data cubes; (2) database support, which focuses on establishing a solid foundation of data access and data aggregation to support interactive exploration of data cubes; (3) data projection, which focuses on developing robust and reliable techniques to project a manifold of data into low space such that the intrinsic structure of the data are preserved. The methodology of this project is to project data to low space and to visually explore the data by using 3D rendering techniques on the multi-resolution high dimensional data cubes. The data cubes are obtained by applying innovative data access techniques to large relational data. The education component includes the development of a new course, the development of a set of interactive online demos, and the creation of a collection of real-world data exploration projects. Expected results include techniques, algorithms and tools that are usable by researchers and end-users. This project has applications in data mining, pattern classification and information retrieval. \r\n",
