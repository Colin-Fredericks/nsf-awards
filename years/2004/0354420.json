 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center (PSLC) addresses a pervasive problem in learning research -- that few if any research results survive the transition from the laboratory to the classroom, from one research and development setting to another, or from one content domain to the next.  Learning research has no shortage of rigorous laboratory results and associated principles, or of realistic classroom design experiments and associated course innovations, but there is a persistent shortage of experimental results that are both rigorous and realistic.  The PSLC has two key goals: (1) to establish a new paradigm of in vivo learning experimention, to produce results that survive rigorous experimentation with laboratory-quality methods in real classroom settings; and (2) to focus research on robust learning, that is, learning that is retained over long durations, transfers to novel situations, and accelerates future learning.  \r\n\r\nPSLC researchers will pursue results within this new paradigm that are guided by, but not limited to, the following research clusters:\r\n1. Co-training. When, how, and why do students' use of multiple inputs, representations or strategies facilitate learning by providing an avenue for self-supervised learning that goes beyond learning supported by teacher and peer feedback?\r\n2. Dialogue. When, how, and why does classroom talk and tutorial dialog, whether by human or computer, promote robust learning?\r\n3. Refinement. How do learners determine the causal connections between cues in the environment, their actions, and desired knowledge and how can instructional support and feedback facilitate learners in making such connections?\r\n4. Fluency. How does more isolated learning of knowledge components interact with learning within larger authentic performances and how can instruction support such interactions to yield more fluent and robust learning?\r\n\r\nTo amortize the demanding set up costs required of individual researchers who want to perform in vivo experimentation, PSLC will develop LearnLab, an international resource for learning scientists that combines classroom testbeds, advanced technology, and a vast, detailed database of learner interactions.  In particular, the LearnLab testbed will include seven highly instrumented courses enhanced with intelligent tutoring systems: Algebra, Geometry, Physics, Chemistry, French, Chinese and English as a second language.  These courses will host the in vivo experimentation.  PSLC will develop the social and technological infrastructure necessary to facilitate such experimentation.\r\n\r\nPSLC activities will address education and diversity goals as well as research goals.  LearnLab both requires and affords pre-doctoral and post-doctoral training of learning scientists to take advantage of this new paradigm. LearnLab will also enrich the scientific infrastructure by establishing extensive collaborations among current and future psychologists, statisticians, psychometricians, computer scientists, engineers, and instructional designers. Experimental manipulations that demonstrate substantial learning gains will be incorporated in LearnLab schools that reach diverse populations and eventually to many other schools.  The PSLC diversity plan includes activities that will increase the pipeline of diverse learners and learning scientists from the high school level to center leaders.\r\n",
