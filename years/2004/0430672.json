 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is proposed that a new family of algorithms for linear programming (more\r\ngenerally, for hyperbolic programming) be further developed, both computationally\r\nand theoretically. Envisioned is a full mathematical development of the new\r\nalgorithmic framework, isolation of those ideas that appear likely to be pertinent\r\nfor constructing truly practical algorithms, and the free availability of implementations\r\n(partly to encourage other researchers to participate and improve on the\r\nefforts).\r\nUnlike existing algorithms for linear programming, the new framework layers\r\ncombinatorial structure. The algorithms work through the layers sequentially,\r\nbeginning with the least complex one, and continuing until an optimal solu-tion\r\nis attained, which generally occurs long before reaching the final layer, i.e.,\r\nlong before explicitly calculating with the full combinatorial structure. The new\r\nidea of layering is made computationally tractable via the elementary symmetric\r\npolynomials, their hyperbolicity cones, and the discrete Fast Fourier Transform\r\n(dFFT).\r\nLinear programming as a modeling tool is pervasive in daily applications, being\r\nrelied upon in all kinds of transportation scheduling, in an array of integrative\r\nfinancial management activities, and more generally, anywhere that limited resources\r\nneed to be deployed most efficiently. A primary bottleneck to even more\r\nextensive use of linear programs,  especially in settings where data change often\r\nis the computational time required to solve linear programs. Consequently,\r\ndevelopment of a novel framework such as the one presented here has the poten-tial\r\nof broader impact on society through the creation of algorithms capable\r\nof attaining linear program solutions faster than before, thereby extending the\r\nusefulness of linear programming as a modeling tool.\r\nIntellectual merit for the proposal comes from the new framework's po-tential\r\nto invigorate algorithmic investigations into linear programming (and its\r\nextensions) by infusing inspiring new concepts into the research area, an area that\r\nhas largely become staid in the 20 years since interior-point methods created stir.\r\nIntellectual merit also comes from the cohesion brought by the framework, a\r\nframework that stretches from engineering (e.g., linear programming, dFFT) to\r\nclassical mathematics (e.g., symmetric functions, Riemannian geometry).",
