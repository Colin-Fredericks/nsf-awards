 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nIt is expected that future generations of wireless communication\r\nsystems will provide a wide variety of services such as voice,\r\nvideo, high speed data, and interactive multimedia for a variety\r\nof users ranging from the stationary to the highly mobile --- with speeds\r\nranging from the pedestrian to high vehicular speeds --- and in a wide\r\nrange of outdoor (urban downtown to rural) as well as indoor\r\n(homes, office buildings, factories, etc.) propagation environments\r\ncommonly encountered in everyday life. Battery limitations in\r\nhand-held devices or laptops and the scarcity of bandwidth relative to the\r\nambitions of such services dictate the need for designing systems in which\r\nthese resources must be used as efficiently as possible.\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on developing a\r\nmathematical theory of two-dimensional ``space-time'' codes based\r\non algebraic number theory for reliable, robust and\r\nresource-efficient data transmission over multi-antenna wireless\r\ncommunication links. Robustness of performance to a variety of\r\nchannel conditions will be emphasized by considering general code\r\ndesign criteria as will problems related to efficient\r\ndecodability. Scalable, high performance space-time codes that can\r\nbe dynamically adapted to changing channel conditions due to\r\nchanges in propagation environments, scattering geometries, and user\r\nmobility will be investigated. Questions of both existence\r\nand construction will be pursued. A new level of generality is\r\nintroduced in this project so that knowledge acquired\r\nfor code design for one model can be applied to other models.\r\nThe long history of mathematics shows that the very level of\r\ngenerality itself can be a guide to what good codes should look\r\nlike.\r\n",
