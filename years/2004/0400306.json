 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe objective of control is to in .uence the behavior of dynamical systems.Achiev-\r\ning fast and accurate control under di .erent environmental conditions,even while\r\nassuring stability and robustness,is the aim of all control system design.When\r\nenvironmental changes are signi .cant (e.g.faults o subsystem failures)the design\r\nmay equire the use of multiple controllers,each of which is appropriate in a speci .c\r\ncontext.By a switching system we mean a hybrid dynamical system with a decision\r\nmechanism which orchestrates the switching between di .erent controllers.With great\r\nadvances in computer technology,and the concomitant increase in the complexity of\r\ndynamical systems,switching system are becoming ubiquitous.The analysis and\r\nsynthesis of such systems is consequently assuming major importance.\r\nStability is the primary equirement of any control system.Once this is assured,\r\noptimization of the performance of the overall system can be undertaken within a\r\nframework of stability.Following this,modi .cations in the control laws can be un-\r\ndertaken to make the system robust under di .erent perturbations.This is the basic\r\nphilosophy used in conventional control system design as well as in this proposal.\r\nEven though research on switching systems has been in progress for many years and\r\nnumerous contributions have been made to the .eld,basic questions still remain unan-\r\nswered.For example the stability of many classes of linear,nonlinear,and adaptive\r\nswitching systems still remains to be answered,and very little progress has been made\r\nin shaping the transient response resulting from the switching action.Both of these\r\nimportant issues are included in the proposal.\r\nThe proposal consists of three parts.Since stability is undoubtedly the most impor-\r\ntant unresolved issue,the .rst part of the proposal is devoted to it.Switching between\r\ngeneral linear time-invariant systems and positive linear systems is treated in this con-\r\ntext.Special attention is given to systems with diagonal Lyapunov functions in view\r\nof their importance to switching in decentralized systems.Also treated are piecewise\r\nlinear systems which are practically important and theoretically tractable.Following\r\nthis,in the second part of the proposal,the performance that can be achieved by\r\nswitching is considered.The third and last part of the proposal is devoted to switch-\r\ning in adaptive systems.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The PI believes that the research proposed addresses funda-\r\nmental questions whose solutions are essential for a better understanding of switching\r\nsystems.This in turn is vital for the design of future control systems.\r\nBroader Impacts: The esearch proposed will enhance collaboration between the\r\nPI and other international esearchers (particularly Dr.Robert Shorten at the Hamil-\r\nton Institute,Ireland and Dr.Jens Kalkuhl of Daimler-Chrysler Research),lead to\r\nincreased interaction with industry,and most important of all,provide training to\r\nboth graduate and undergraduate students on advanced control techniques.\r\n1",
