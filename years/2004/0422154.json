 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop an automated monitoring system for residents living in elder care facilities. This system  will  enable  the  facility  staff  to  quickly respond  to  any  event  or  behavior  requiring  intervention,  such  as  an  accidental  fall, using computer vision for tracking and behavior analysis. Prior Phase I research demonstrated the feasibility of this  approach  for  fall  detection  and  behavior  analysis  with  the  help  of  a  laboratory  prototype. This work also highlighted several challenges, such as dealing with changing lighting conditions and complex behaviors. Phase II research will focus on addressing these challenges and creating twelve beta sites in actual elder care facilities to further develop and test the algorithms. \r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project will be on institutions linked to the care of the elderly. With  over  50%  of  the  growing  population  of  seniors  staying  in  independent / assistive  living  facilities  or nursing homes, injuries and deaths resulting from unattended falls represent a serious societal and economical problem. Over 1.8 million seniors fall each year, with each fall costing an average of $9,400 in hospitalization. The proposed work could  lead  to  a  solution  that  provides  a  way  for  quickly  responding  to  falls,  saving hospitalization costs up to 26% and more importantly, reducing the likelihood of death by as much as 82%.  It would also help in generating a feeling of security for the elders and their care givers, without a substantial increase  in  healthcare  costs. \r\n",
