The system will significantly enhance research and fabrication of quantum dots and multi-junction thin films by adding the capability to prepare these nanostructures. It brings a new capability for nanostructure fabrication and characterization at NCCU. The system will complement existing capability at the institution such as Raman spectroscopy, Photoluminescence (PL), Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Thermo Stimulated Current (TSC), Hall effect, and FTIR methods.   The instrument will also be used for the advanced research and training of faculty members and postdoctoral students in optics and nanotechnology. It will contribute to bring more NCCU undergraduates into nanoscience training and research and produce students with higher intellectual capacity. The instrument will contribute to enhance the competitiveness of multidisciplinary science programs at NCCU and improve conditions for the faculty and student. The PLD system will be open for collaborative use with other HBCU's. The award will help NCCU expand its training for African American graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n%%%\r\nNorth Carolina Central University will acquire a state of the art pulsed laser deposition (PLD) system.
