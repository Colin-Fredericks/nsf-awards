The two institutions will create an inclusive learning environment through (a) strengthening faculty-student and student-peer relationships using collaborative and multicultural teaching and learning practices and (b) strengthening student self-efficacy, optimism, career management, and collaboration and coping skills. All beginning CS students will participate in a required, semester-long class that presents a realistic preview of the challenges of being a computer science major, techniques and skills for coping with such challenges, training in attitudes and beliefs that foster persistence, and use of role models to describe the career rewards that are possible in computer science. Faculty will be trained in \"wise schooling\" techniques to foster inclusiveness. Faculty will also include pair programming and collaborative learning in programming classes. \r\n\r\n",
