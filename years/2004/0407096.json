 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Nanotechnology in Undergraduate Education (NUE) award to Southern Illinois University Edwardsville supports Professors Eric J. Voss (Chemistry), Michael J. Shaw (Chemistry), Paul E. Wanda (Biological Sciences), Nader Saniei (Mechanical Engineering), and Mark G. Bolyard (Biological Sciences and Office of Science and Math Education) to incorporate nanoscale science and engineering experiments and demonstrations into introductory courses at the University.  Introductory courses to be modified include an Honors Scholars freshman seminar course, a contemporary chemistry course, four general chemistry for scientists courses, two general chemistry for engineers courses, and a senior-level interdisciplinary nanoscale science and engineering course.  These courses form the foundation of the science curriculum at the University, and as a result of this project, approximately 1000 science and engineering students each year would be introduced to nanoscale topics.  This student body would also include future pharmacists, veterinarians, dentists, and physicians.\r\n\r\n       Nanoscale science and engineering experiments and demonstrations will be introduced into introductory courses.   Student learning objectives include excitement and enthusiasm for science thinking, awareness of nanotechnology and nano applications of scientific thinking, 3-D manipulation of concepts, and improved quantitative reasoning, problem solving, analysis, and synthesis.  The project will also involve an annual one-day Teachers Exploring the Nano world, professional development workshop for high school science educators from Southwestern Illinois and the Metro East St. Louis Region. Teachers attending this workshop would be able to incorporate examples from nanoscience into their curricula, resulting in college and university bound students, who are aware of nanoscience.  In addition to the local and regional impact, educational materials resulting from these efforts would be broadly disseminated through the web-based Nanoscale Video Lab Manual and Nanoworld Cineplex of Movies.\r\n\r\nThe proposal for this award was received in response to the Nanoscale Science and Engineering Education announcement, NSF 03-044, category NUE and was jointly funded by the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences and the Directorate for Engineering.",
