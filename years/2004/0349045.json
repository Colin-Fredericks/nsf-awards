 "awd_abstract_narration": "Professor Frontier will develop Lewis acid-catalyzed Nazarov reactions - electrocyclization of divinyl ketones, affording cyclopentenones via stereospecific conrotatory bond formation. During the project period, Professor Frontier will improve the efficiency of the catalytic Nazarov reaction and achieve asymmetric induction  using chiral ligands for the Lewis acid catalyst, identify trends correlating substrate structure with reactivity, define the scope and utility of the reaction, and establish the methodology as a versatile synthetic tool by applying it to the synthesis of representative complex target molecules. Professor Frontier will develop and maintain a Web site designed to serve as a resource and discussion forum for students involved in the laboratory practice of organic chemistry at all levels.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program is supporting the teaching and research activities of Professor Alison J. Frontier, of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Rochester. Professor Frontier is developing novel reaction chemistry which allows the facile construction of complex molecular structures from structurally simple precursors. Her studies are providing new tools for selective transformations utlizing only small (catalytic) quantities of reagents and offering promise for general applicability in the synthesis of biologically or chemically active organic molecules. Through the design and maintenance of a Web site serving as a resource and discussion forum for students involved in the laboratory practice of organic chemistry, Professor Frontier is demystifying the successful practice of synthetic organic chemistry and facilitating the widespread sharing of technical expertise and scientific wisdom.",
