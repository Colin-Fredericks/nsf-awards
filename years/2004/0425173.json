Johnson School of Public Affairs, University of Texas at Austin, and Prof. Judith Mariscal of the Centro de Investigacion y Docencias Economicas (CIDE), Mexico, where it will be held, intends to bring together academic researchers at the leading edge of research on Internet use in different countries of the Americas, with national policymakers from those countries. The workshop will explore the roles of socioeconomic factors and national policies in explaining varying degrees of Internet penetration in different countries of the Western Hemisphere, reasons for varied patterns of use across countries, and differential impacts on national economies. Policy issues to be addressed include the role of national policy in explaining differences in rates of diffusion and national patterns of Internet use, innovative applications of the Internet toward economic and social development objectives, and differing national approaches to policies affecting the development and use of the Internet. \r\n\r\nThe workshop format will include panels with policymakers from national governments discussing the rationale, objectives, and performance of national policy initiatives, with academics as discussants, interspersed with panels of researchers presenting the results of their research, with national policymakers as discussants.  A published, edited conference volume is an expected outcome of the meeting.\r\n\r\n",
