 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop in real-time networked embedded systems focuses on future automotive systems.  The workshop will explore embedded system architectures, automotive software services, platforms, on- and off-board ad-hoc networking, networked automotive services, mobile sensor services, security and privacy issues for automotive applications, and enabling technology for automotive applications. The workshop brings together experts from industry and academia, who work on highly complex, distributed, reactive software systems related to the automotive domain. The expected outcome is deeper insight into the research challenges and proposed solutions for future automotive embedded software. This will help develop understanding by industry, academia, and Federal agencies of the research needed to advance progress in this embedded systems domain.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of this workshop is the opportunity to stimulate communications between academia and industry, fuel international collaboration, and enhance communication between diverse research communities. Because of the pervasive demand for highly complex, dependable software systems, the workshop results are also relevant in many application domains beyond automotive, such as avionics, medical and telecommunications systems.\r\n",
