 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nIn partnership with the Science.gov Alliance, the principal investigator, Dr.\r\nWilliam E. McHenry and the co-principal investigator Dr. John S. Colonias propose to\r\ncreate a web-based comprehensive one-stop science, technology, engineering, and\r\nmathematics (STEM) educational resource tool  the Science Education Resource Virtual\r\nDiversity Center (SER Virtual Diversity Center). The SER Virtual Diversity Center will\r\nfeature: (1) STEM education programs by category of federal support; (2) promising\r\npractices and lessons learned from federal STEM education supporting agencies as well as\r\nfrom the institutions they support; (3) STEM-based educational resources for students and\r\nparents; and (4) a virtual electronic campus designed to assist institutions in sharing\r\nSTEM educational courses and degree programs using the internet.\r\n\r\nMerit. The SER Virtual Diversity Center will serve as the major STEM education content\r\nportal for federal programs that target increasing participation from women,\r\nunderrepresented minorities, and persons with disabilities in the STEM workforce and\r\neventually serve as a tool for sharing information on all strategies designed to address\r\nthe nation's STEM workforce needs. The SER Virtual Diversity Center will use\r\ntechnology-enabled processes to connect federal agencies with each other and with higher\r\neducation faculty and administrators; K-12 teachers, counselors, administrators; students\r\nand parents in order to achieve dramatic improvement in efficiency for those involved in\r\nincreasing minority participation in STEM -- especially federal agencies.\r\n\r\nImpact. As outlined in the BEST Report, the participation of American students in STEM\r\nfields must dramatically increase if America is to remain competitive in a global economy.\r\nWith the American population becoming more diverse, students from groups that are\r\ntraditionally underrepresented in STEM fields must be encouraged to participate.\r\nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions\r\n(HSIs), and Tribal Colleges have a record of unparalleled success with these students. The\r\nNSF's HRD Programs, especially the Model Institutions for Excellence (MIE) and alliance\r\nprograms, are examples of the impact partnerships between the federal government and\r\nminority-serving institutions can have on increasing the capacity of those institutions\r\nfor producing STEM professionals. Purposively, the SER Virtual Diversity Center will\r\nenable federal agency program officers to better access information across agency lines,\r\ncoordinate science education initiatives, and connect agencies more directly with higher\r\neducation institutions and their faculty and school districts and their teachers,\r\ncounselors, students, and parents to create STEM knowledge-based communities.\r\nThe authors propose to create a one-stop SER Virtual Diversity Center through which\r\nfederal agency program officers and others can view:  (1) STEM education programs by\r\ncategory of federal support; (2) promising practices and lessons learned from federal STEM\r\neducation supporting agencies as well as from the institutions they support; (3)\r\nSTEM-based educational resources for students and parents; and (4) a virtual electronic\r\ncampus designed to assist institutions in sharing STEM educational courses and degree\r\nprograms using the internet.\r\n\r\n",
