The activity, which is being organized by Dr. Edgar Lopez-Escobar of the University of Maryland and Dr. Jorge Guier of the University of Costa Rica, will bring together some of the top researchers in logic from the USA and Latin America, and encourage young researchers in the United States and Latin America to further studies in the subject.\r\n\r\nThe Latin American Symposia on Mathematical Logic (Simposios Latino\r\nAmericanos de Logica Matematica, SLALM) aim (1) to establish working relationships between researchers in Latin America and the United States, (2) to produce, as a result of joint work, both new areas of investigations as well as new results in the traditional areas, and (3) to encourage graduate students and junior faculty from Latin America to obtain higher degrees and postdocs at universities in the United States; the majority returning to their country and assuming leadership positions at their institutions. The SLALMs have been organized, since their inception in 1976, in the form of a working symposium preceded by a series of training mini-courses, some given by the symposium plenary speakers.  The pre-symposium school (01/7-10/2004) will consist of 4 mini-courses. The symposium (01/12-16/2004) will consist of invited and contributed talks as well as working sessions on various areas of mathematical logic.\r\n\r\nPublication of the Proceedings of the XII SLALM is an expected outcome. Furthermore, the Web page: //www.vinv.ucr.ac.cr/slalm04 has been set up for day to day updates on many aspects of the symposium, including participants and lecturers.\r\n\r\nThe Office of International Science and Engineering and the Division of Mathematical Sciences are jointly supporting this activity.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
