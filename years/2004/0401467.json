The PI has just received her Ph.D., which involved massively parallel molecular dynamics simulations of crack-front dynamics in amorphous silicon. She will conduct research at Saclay, France and collaborate with the University of Paris XI. The research involves: (1) multiscale simulation of plasticity in glasses using finite element and molecular dynamics techniques, and (2) atomic force microscopy experiments on stress-corrosion fracture in glasses and algorithm design for the analysis of mechanical damage in the experiments. Apart from broader impacts on the education of a member of an underrepresented group and providing valuable experiences for a globally competitive workforce, the research itself has potential impact on the problem of long-term storage and processing of nuclear waste. \r\n%%%\r\nThis Mathematical and Physical Sciences Distinguished International Postdoctoral Research Fellowship award supports research on plasticity, fracture and stress corrosion in glasses.
