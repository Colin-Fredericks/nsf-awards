 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nA travel grant ($24,750) is recommended for 30 U.S. chemical engineering professors to participate in the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC) Symposium on\r\nAdvanced Control of Chemical Processes (ADCHEM 2003), Jan. 11-14, 2004 in Hong Kong. An allocation of $750 per person will be made for partial airfare or registration fee support.\r\n\r\nProcess control has been a fundamental research area and an enabling technology for efficient chemical processing and manufacturing. On the other hand, the globalization in chemical and material processing has brought fierce competition for the U.S. chemical manufacturers to outperform in the global economic environment. \r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impact:\r\n\r\nThe broad impact of the project is to help US academicians and graduate students to participate in this international conference to facilitate their scientific and intellectual exchange with the international community.  It is expected that the trip will help US academic researchers and graduate students assess the status of research and development around the world and thus better position themselves in the control area.\r\n",
