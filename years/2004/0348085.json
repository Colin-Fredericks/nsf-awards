 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to Dr. Derek Lovley of the University of Massachusetts to investigate novel microorganisms, known as hyperthermophiles, that live at the temperature of boiling water, or even hotter. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the range of environmental conditions under which hyperthermophiles can exist and the types of reactions that hyperthermophiles can use to gain energy to support their growth.  For example, the upper temperature limit at which life is possible will be carefully evaluated.   Studies will be conducted to explore the hypothesis that there is a wide diversity of hyperthermophiles capable of living in the absence of oxygen by oxidizing hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide with the reduction of the iron oxides or sulfur that are abundant in some hot environments. The possibility that there are hyperthermophiles that can grow on soluble ferric iron under highly acidic conditions will also be studied.  New approaches to the isolation of hyperthermophiles will be used in an attempt to isolate the microorganisms that still exist on Earth that are most closely related to the microbes which are thought to be the ancestors of all current life on Earth. \r\n\r\nThese studies are expected to improve the understanding of how microbial life evolved on the hot, early Earth and the functioning of hot microbial ecosystems in modern environments, such as those associated with terrestrial hot springs, marine hydrothermal vents, and the deep subsurface.  The results will help further define the conditions under which life might be found on other planets. This research has the potential to provide substantial economic benefit by suggesting new strategies for the remediation of toxic contaminants and the recovery of hydrocarbons from petroleum reservoirs.  The findings may also furnish information that will aid in the search for ore deposits and is likely to yield new, heat-stable enzymes with possible industrial applications.\r\n",
