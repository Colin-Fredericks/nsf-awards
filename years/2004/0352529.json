 "awd_abstract_narration": "This thirty-three month project will develop instructional materials for grade 6-12 students and will result in thirty-five additional online activities in the areas of biology and Earth science building on the successful Virtual Courseware Project, which resulted in a biology online lab with 20 activities.  The materials will be designed to support science teachers in their efforts to implement inquiry-based learning activities in their classrooms.  The products will include web-based simulations and supporting materials covering many life and Earth sciences topics and closely tied to the National Science Content Standards.  Each activity includes a step-by-step guide that provides an overview, an open-ended simulation so students can design and carry out experiments based on their own hypotheses, a performance-based assessment quiz, electronic portfolios, student manuals and teacher guides. \r\n\r\nThe teacher materials include online access to quantitative results for their students by overall class average, by individual student, by specific question and by learning objective.  Teachers can access the students' electronic portfolios and are provided portfolio assessment rubrics.  Teacher guides, content and context background and suggestions for implementing for individual and group-based work are provided.  Teachers from Los Angeles schools are involved in the design of the instructional materials and in the field testing.  A commercial publisher will market the materials. \r\n\r\n",
