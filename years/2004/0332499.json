 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Materials World Modules (MWM) are inquiry-based, supplementary materials that bridge the gap between traditional science curricula and real-world applications.  The original modules were content based.  The MWM-2002 modules are concept-based modules designed to develop \"enduring understandings\" through a series of hands-on learning experiences culminating in a design task, which serves as evidence of the conceptual understanding.  Five modules have been developed and tested: Structure and Properties of Matter, Forces and Motion, Materials and the Environment, Properties of Solutions, and Bonding and Polarity.  To be developed and field tested are Nanotechnology, Electrical Conductivity, Kinetics in Catalytic Reactions, Biotechnology, and Light and Color.  The modules are developed in partnership with teachers.  The inquiry-based, design modules are integrated with digital resources, video-based teacher training workshops, real-time teacher evaluations, comprehensive student assessments and cyberinfrastructure support.  Teachers can customize on-line the modules for local conditions.  Evaluation of the materials includes student outcomes, teacher satisfaction and alignment to standards.  Other support is sought for large-scale dissemination.",
