 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is focused on developing accurate and efficient numerical\r\nmethods for the simulation of astrophysical flows. This project will build\r\non a class of high-resolution shock-capturing methods that have in the\r\nlast few years gained popularity in astrophysics. Several numerical\r\nchallenges will be investigated including computing high Lorentz factor\r\nflows; maintaining divergence-free magnetic fields as dictated by Maxwell's\r\nequations; incorporating space-time curvature for general relativistic\r\nflows; including radiative cooling physics; and accurately simulating\r\nmulti-component flows. Adaptive mesh refinement techniques will be\r\nincorporated into the simulations in order to resolve regions of the\r\nflow where the solution is rapidly varying, and conversely, to use\r\nless resolution in regions where the solution remains nearly constant.\r\nSpecial attention will be given to two application problems: the special\r\nrelativistic problem of the interaction of pulsar wind nebulae with\r\nsupernovae remnants and the general relativistic problem of accretion\r\nonto a rotating black hole.\r\n\r\n\r\nAstrophysics, much like weather prediction and climatology, is a field of\r\nscience in which observations are possible, but direct experimentation is\r\nnot. Therefore, direct experiments are replaced by computer simulations. In\r\norder to carry out these simulations, sophisticated tools from computational\r\nmathematics are required to approximately solve the nonlinear system of\r\nequations that model astrophysical flows. Examples of such flows include the\r\nformation of pulsar wind nebulae and the accretion of matter into a black hole.\r\nA feature of these flows, and consequently the equations that model them, is\r\nthat they can lead to complicated solutions with sharp discontinuities. Over\r\nthe past few decades, an important class of computer methods has been\r\ndeveloped to accurately and efficiently approximate such solutions. More\r\nrecently these methods have been applied to astrophysical fluid dynamics. This\r\nresearch will focus on developing and implementing generalizations of these\r\nmethods and also on the application of these methods to specific astrophysical\r\nproblems. The P.I. is actively involved in collaborations between researchers\r\nin both the Mathematics and Astronomy Departments at the University of Michigan.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
