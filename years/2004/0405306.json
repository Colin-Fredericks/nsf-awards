 "awd_abstract_narration": "0405306\r\nMacKay\r\nOur proposed project has significant intellectual merit because it explicitly addresses two key\r\nproblems facing hydrology. The first problem concerns the opposing views of stomatal control of\r\nwater fluxes, with one perspective assuming carbon assimilation control, and the other assuming\r\nan environmental control. Our conceptual model combines both of these perspectives in a unified\r\nmechanistic framework that combines both assimilation and water potential controls on\r\ntranspiration. The second problem addressed by our conceptual model is the tendency towards\r\nfavoring complex and often mathematically ill-posed canopy models over simpler, verifiable\r\nones. We explicitly address this fundamental issue in hydrologic modeling by using a novel,\r\nobject-oriented canopy model that can flexibly adjust its structure and mechanisms to the data it\r\nis provided. By adjusting model complexity spatially we will gain deep insights on species\r\nplasticity and restrictions thereof across spatial gradients, thus providing a rigorous approach to\r\ntesting our conceptual model within our study site in northern Wisconsin.\r\nThe knowledge gained from our proposed research has broad implications for land surface\r\nmodeling efforts seeking to generate accurate predictions of global change effects on water\r\ncycling. By developing our conceptual model we will be able to provide a relatively simple, but\r\ntransportable and scientifically defensible model. Such models are essential foundations for the\r\ncreation and implementation of credible state, federal and international policies aimed at\r\nmitigating or otherwise adjusting to the consequences of anticipated global change. The\r\neducational emphasis of this project is multi-faceted. First, we will seek additional funding and\r\nother means of supporting, advising and training an integrated team of undergraduate students\r\nfrom the economically disadvantaged region of Northern Wisconsin, using this project as the\r\nprincipal context for their education in Forest Ecology at UW-Madison. Also, in connection with\r\nthe NSF Research Collaboration Network project entitled \"Chequamegon Ecosystem-\r\nAtmosphere Study,\" for which Mackay is a core project participant, we will hold a nationally\r\nadvertised workshop on multi-scale canopy flux measurements and modeling. The PIs will\r\ncontinue to recruit and hire minorities and other underrepresented students in our respective\r\nfields.",
