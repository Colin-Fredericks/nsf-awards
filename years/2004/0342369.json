The functionality will be extended to encompass automated generation of code targeting APIs for different languages, automated cost analysis for architectures with multi-level memories (including distributed memory) as well as automated stability analysis.  The input to the system will be matrix operations in form of linear algebraic expression.  The output will be entire families of algorithms for the given operations, high-performance implementations for sequential and parallel architectures, cost analyses of the implementations, and stability analyses of the algorithms. A demonstration of the system will be the automatic creation of a next-generation high-performance library with functionality that encompasses LAPACK and more, parameterized for a broad range of sequential and parallel architectures.\r\n\r\nIt is the reduction to a system of the knowledge that underlies the\r\ndevelopment of high-performance linear algebra libraries that\r\nrepresents the primary contribution to science of this project.\r\nAutomation of the kind that is targeted is the ultimate demonstration\r\nof the level of understanding that has been achieved.\r\n\r\nThe success of the proposed work will then measured by: (1) the\r\nbroadness of applicability of the automated tools; (2) the amount of\r\neffort required to accommodate new architectural features; and (3) the\r\nease with which new functionality can be accommodated by the tools.\r\nIn other words, the measurement of success will largely be with\r\nrespect to productivity, maintenance, and applicability.\r\n\r\n",
