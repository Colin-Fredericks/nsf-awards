The relevant NSF award is to Dr. Charles Paull of Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, award # OCE 01-17661.  OCE and OPP jointly supported the review and recommendation of the award, with OPP supporting the ship time.  Time on a US Ice breaker was not available in the requested year (2002) so OPP requested support from Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans who coordinate the science use of  Canadian Coast Guard Ice Breaker assets.   The project was carried out in September of 2003 involving a two-ship operation and an international research team working in Canadian waters off the Mackenzie River Delta.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
