 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims for greater understanding of basic phenomena related to interface energetics and molecular levels for carrier transport and doping of organic based electronic/photonic device structures. The approach is to link detailed measurements of interface electronic levels, injection processes, morphology and chemistry with transport data, and to develop an energy level-based rationale for choosing and evaluating materials combinations and structures for devices. \r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to new understanding and capabilities in electronic/photonic devices. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. The project is collaborative in nature and includes teaching of organic-related issues at the undergraduate, graduate and professional levels. Collaborations are established with chemists and theoreticians which will expose all parties involved, especially students, to multiple facets of the physics, chemistry and technology of organic films. The PI's research group includes graduate and undergraduate students with strong representation of minorities. In addition, the PI is instrumental in introducing and promoting the field of organic films and interfaces at meetings such as the AVS, the Science and Technology Society. The impact on education of the AVS scientific community is considerable. The PI is also heavily involved with outreach programs at Princeton University. In general, understanding material/molecular interfaces has broad and practical implications for device design and modeling, an area that industry has great need for at present. \r\n***\r\n",
