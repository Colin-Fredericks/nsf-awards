 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louisville Science Center (LSC) proposes to develop \"The World Around Us (WAU),\" an 8,000 sq ft exhibition, plus programs and materials designed to increase environmental awareness of citizens, inspiring greater understanding and respect for earth's natural resources. \r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT \r\nExhibition components are CenterStage; AtmoSphere: Air that Surrounds Us; TerraSphere: Environments that Support Us; and AquaSphere: Water that Sustains Us.  The exhibition integrates hands-on activities and media-based visitor experiences with approximately 1,000 specimens from the LSC collections.  The project takes an interdisciplinary thematic approach founded in educational goals and STEM content that is closely linked to national science standards.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT\r\nTarget audiences are children in grades 3-8, parents, caregivers and teachers. LSC expects to reach some five million visitors over ten years after opening the exhibition.  The project focuses on reaching rural and underserved audiences in Kentucky and Indiana.  Its impact will be extended through strong ties to the schools and with ancillary materials.  The distance learning capability of the Collections Discovery Gallery will extend the reach of the exhibition beyond the museum walls.  In addition, the application of PDAs and handheld GIS technology will add to experience of the field in these areas.  Dissemination of \"green\" fabrication techniques will help other science centers follow similar approaches. \r\n\r\n",
