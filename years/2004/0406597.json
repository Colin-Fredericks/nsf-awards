 "awd_abstract_narration": "Every ``theory'' of games concentrates on one particular\r\naspect of games, and ignores the rest.\r\nTraditional Game Theory (J. von Neumann, J. Nash, etc.)\r\nfocuses on the lack of complete information\r\n(e.g., card games like Poker).\r\nGames of complete information, like Chess, Go, Checkers, and\r\nTic-Tac-Toe, are ignored by the traditional theory.\r\nHere the investigator develops a new branch of game theory.\r\nHe focuses on ``Tic-Tac-Toe like games'' (officially called Positional Games),\r\na large and imortant class of games of ``complete information'',\r\nand develops a ``fake probability theory''.\r\nIn fact, the investigator continues his on-going research\r\nstarted in the  prior proposals.\r\nThe basic challenge of games of ``complete information''\r\nis to handle the ``combinatorial chaos''.\r\nTo analyze a position (say in Chess, or in multi-dimensional\r\nTic-Tac-Toe), one has\r\n to examine all of its options, and all the\r\noptions of these options, and all the options of the options of these\r\noptions, and so on. The\r\nexhaustive search through the ``game-tree''\r\ntakes enormous amount of time.\r\nOne way to make up for the lack of time\r\nis to study the random walk on the game-tree,\r\nthat is, to study the randomized game where\r\n both players play randomly.\r\nThe most surprising part of the proposal\r\nis how the probabilistic analysis of the randomized game is converted,\r\nvia potential arguments, into an explicit (deterministic) optimal strategy.\r\nThe investigator calls it a ``mathematical paradox'' for good reason.\r\nGame Theory is about perfect players, and it is very\r\nsurprising that a play between random generators\r\n(``dumb players'') has anything to do with  a play between perfect\r\nplayers! In contrast to ``Poker and randomness'', which is a natural\r\ncombination (see e.g. the role of ``bluffing''), ``Tic-Tac-Toe and \r\nrandomness''sounds like a very strange mismatch. The justification of this\r\nmismatch requires a long technical explanation.\r\nThe theoretical significance of the proposal is that\r\nit brings the remote subjects of Probability\r\nTheory, Combinatorics, and Game Theory close to each other\r\nin a novel, unexpected way.\r\n\r\n",
