 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award provides funds to develop a new type of ultra high-speed camera that will be used for simultaneous full-field deformation and temperature measurements.  The camera will be developed by adding two commercially available dual-frame image-intensified cameras and two high power pulsed lasers to a new type of modular ultra high speed non-intensified camera system developed through a prior Major Research Instrumentation grant.  This will permit ultra high-speed full field temperature measurement using the two-wave Laser Induced Fluorescence technique, simultaneously with Digital Image Correlation based deformation measurement.  This system will be used to experimentally quantify the average strain rate and temperature fields in the primary and secondary shear zones in metal cutting, and to study the dynamics of these fields under a range of commercial cutting conditions.\r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation award will add to the capabilities of the first and only ultra high-speed camera in the state of Kansas and its availability for use will strengthen the research and education infrastructure of the state.  This equipment can be used in any field where high-resolution ultra high framing rate thermographic images are needed, or whenever simultaneous deformation and temperature frames are needed.  This concept is currently being patented and it is anticipated that this instrument will be marketed as a commercial product and used by researchers in a variety of different areas.  The broader impacts potentially also include the benefits of better understanding of the temperature field in metal cutting, which is of prime importance in tool wear and product quality, and the creation and dissemination of improved models of metal cutting that can be used in education.",
