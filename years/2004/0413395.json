 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant will support theoretical research in two related areas of condensed matter physics.  The first involves the study of Josephson junctions and groups of Josephson junctions, especially when coupled to a single-mode resonant cavity.  We will investigate these systems both classically and quantum-mechanically.  In the classical regime, such systems are described dynamically by coupled nonlinear differential equations which we will analyze both numerically and analytically, with particular attention being paid to coupling via the magnetic field of the cavity mode.  In the quantum regime, groups of junctions (whether or not coupled to a cavity) can often be treated as groups of two-level systems which can be experimentally controlled, initialized, and read out.  In the second area of research, we will study the electromagnetic properties of a wide range of granular materials.  Among the specific problems planned for study are plasmon wave propagation in one-and two-dimensional arrays of metallic nanoparticles, electromagnetic response of random nanocomposites of metal and anisotropic hosts, optical and structural properties of composites of gold nanoparticles and DNA, nonlinear light scattering from granular materials, forces in suspensions of dielectric particles, and electromagnetic response of cuprate superconductors arising from intrinsic inhomogeneities.  These problems have the common theme that they involve the study of materials which are structured at a scale of 10-1000nm.\r\n\r\nThe project will have an extensive educational impact by training graduate students, postdoctoral associates and undergraduates in a range of techniques in theoretical condensed matter physics, and will thus increase the pool of highly trained scientists in the U.S., including women and members of underrepresented groups.  The scientific advances developed will be presented in courses offered at Ohio State, and in seminars elsewhere.\r\n%%%\r\nThis grant will support theoretical research in two related areas of condensed matter physics.
