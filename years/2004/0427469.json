 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Hot Quarks 2004 Workshop will take place on July 18-24, 2004 \r\nin Taos, NM. The main topic of the workshop is the physics\r\nof strongly interacting nuclear matter at extreme energy densities.\r\nQuantum Chromo-Dynamics, the theory describing the forces acting \r\nwithin atomic nuclei, predicts that at sufficiently\r\nhigh temperatures and/or densities, matter should undergo a\r\ntransition from the standard hadronic phase to a plasma of\r\ndeconfined quarks and gluons (Quark Gluon Plasma, QGP) - a\r\ntransition which, according to our cosmological models,\r\ntook place in the early universe about 10 microseconds after the Big\r\nBang.\r\n\r\nAlready the programs at the Brookhaven National Laboratory\r\nAlternating Gradient Synchrotron (AGS) and the CERN Super Proton\r\nSynchrotron (SPS) have produced evidence for the onset of new\r\nphenomena. The research in this field is now successfully\r\ncontinuing at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL\r\nwhile the next phase, to take place at the CERN Large Hadron\r\nCollider (LHC), is under preparation. There are around 2000\r\nphysicists worldwide working in the field: a very active\r\nand lively, expanding community. In such a context, good\r\ncommunication and networking, especially among the young and\r\nproductive members in the field, are vital.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this particular workshop is to enhance the direct \r\nexchange of scientific information among the younger \r\nmembers of the community (graduate students, postdocs and \r\njunior faculty), both from the experiment and theory. \r\nParticipation in the workshop will be by invitation \r\nonly - in order to strengthen  the emphasis on younger members\r\nof the community, participation will be restricted to people\r\nwho have obtained their Ph.D. no earlier than 1989.\r\n\r\nThis particular approach makes the workshop unique among the \r\nvarious workshops and conferences in the field. \r\nFor young scientists it represents an opportunity \r\nfor exchange and exposure that that they would not have in one of \r\nthe major big conferences. It will help to stimulate \r\nthe next generation of the field and strengthen their sense \r\nof community. \r\n\r\n",
