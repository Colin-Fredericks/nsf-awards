 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Alabama at Birmingham, the University of Houston, the University of\r\nMemphis, Birmingham City Schools, Memphis City Schools, and Houston ISD will implement and evaluate a program for the support and induction of secondary science and mathematics teachers into urban school systems.  Goals of the five year project include:\r\n\r\no develop and implement models for beginning science and mathematics teacher induction and\r\nsupport\r\no determine which model(s) are most effective in urban environments.\r\no enhance the content knowledge and pedagogical skills of secondary science and math teachers\r\no increase beginning teachers' understanding of urban classroom and community environments\r\no prepare experienced teachers as mentors and teacher leaders in their schools and districts\r\no contribute to the research-based understanding of preparing and supporting science and\r\nmathematics teachers in urban systems.\r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT:  This project will use rigorous research methods to investigate an important question: How can we provide better support for beginning teachers in urban settings to reverse the large attrition rate and to improve science and mathematics instruction?  Project partners have extensive background in working with urban schools and conducting research.\r\n\r\nBROADER IMPACT:  The project will directly impact 120 - 180 beginning secondary science and mathematics teachers and 72 mentor teachers and improve the learning experience for over 67,500 students in three urban school systems.  Because of the large minority population served, the project will have a major impact on underrepresented ethnic groups.  The project partners are nationally established in education and are poised to widely disseminate findings and products.\r\n\r\n",
