 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering-Engineering Technology (58)  The project is enhancing Drexel's new Manufacturing Engineering Technology (MET) curriculum through the incorporation of state-of-the-art Internet based robotics, automation, and CAD/CAM/CNC technology.  The project is using information and communication technologies to develop real-time control of production processes, which is a key element in creating and deploying global manufacturing enterprises. The project is adapting Internet based technologies that other schools of engineering have developed in robotics, CAD, communication, and information management. Adaptation includes Internet programming, design and production, E-commerce, and advanced manufacturing systems from Industrial Engineering at the University of Iowa; sensor-based intelligent process control, tele-robotics, and machine vision systems and motion control in Mechanical Engineering at Drexel University; E-transactions, and Internet supply-chain and network integration from Industrial Engineering at Arizona State University; Internet based reverse engineering and advanced manufacturing, and artificial intelligence in manufacturing and process optimization from Industrial and Manufacturing at Bradley University; and E-manufacturing, precision, sensor-based manufacturing and automation, and  Internet based collaboration and product design from Manufacturing Sciences at Western Kentucky University.   \r\n\r\nCourses are being restructured and new courses developed to support a new Mechatronics laboratory. This is providing students with contemporary practices and hands-on skills for an expanding e-manufacturing sector. The project is integrating Internet based technologies with those at other universities and community colleges in the Greater Philadelphia Region to provide students access to the curriculum that is being develop at Drexel. Distant delivery is enabling students of diverse educational backgrounds to develop technical skills needed to enter the workforce in this emerging technology. The project is targeting women and minority students.\r\n",
