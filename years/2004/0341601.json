 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer Science (31)\r\n\r\nThis project focused on Machine Learning (ML) and has the following objectives \r\n1)\tthe development of educational material in the form of software implementations of ML algorithms and the compilation of accompanying documentation; \r\n2)\tthe creation of an on-line ML Repository via the archiving of the developed products; \r\n3)\tthe authoring of 3-4 chapters of an undergraduate ML textbook; \r\n4)\tthe introduction of ML research in the participating institutions curricula and;  \r\n5)\tthe dissemination of the developed material through the on-line outlet, the affiliated academic institutions and industries.\r\nThe objectives are achieved by forming Student Design Project teams consisting of undergraduate students from the partnering Universities and Community Colleges. Each team works on the implementation of a ML algorithm and its documentation and on a related research topic supervised by their assigned PI. A team of PIs with strong teaching and research experience in ML, as well as extensive experience on supervising senior design teams achieves the project's objectives. EMD-MLR's objectives impact 80 students, some of which are members of underrepresented groups (in particular UCF and SCC students). Furthermore, the project's focus enhances partnerships amongst 4 neighboring institutions, and many more affiliate Universities dispersed within the US and abroad. The University partnerships constitute the anchor of an elaborate dissemination plan that is multi-faceted and self-sustained.\r\n",
