 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe primary goal of the proposed research in this project is to\r\ndevelop the mathematical tools needed to prove several outstanding conjectures\r\nin Quantum Information Theory. The central conjecture states that\r\nminimal output entropy is additive for product channels, where a channel\r\nis the mathematical representation of a noisy quantum system. The\r\nmathematical setting concerns properties of\r\ncompletely positive maps on matrix algebras. Building on results and\r\nmethods from\r\nearlier work, the PI expects to establish this conjecture for all\r\nqubit maps, and in the process develop tools that will apply to higher\r\ndimensional\r\nmaps. The PI expects to produce results that are both mathematically\r\ninteresting\r\nand also useful for quantum information theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuantum Information Theory is concerned with exploring the new resources that\r\nare available in physical systems whose behavior is wholly or partly\r\ngoverned by\r\nquantum effects, for example single-atom systems and single-photon states.\r\nRecent theoretical\r\ndiscoveries\r\nindicate that such systems may have extraordinary properties. One example\r\nis the quantum computer, which is a theoretical device capable of\r\noutperforming any standard computer. Another example is a protocol for\r\nunconditionally secure encryption, which would be achieved by encoding\r\nmessages as quantum states. Mathematics has played an essential role in the\r\ndevelopment of these new ideas. The present proposal is aimed at using\r\nadvanced mathematical techniques to explore the implications of\r\nusing entangled quantum states in communication systems.\r\nA fundamental problem is to determine the\r\ninformation capacity of such a system, and thereby find the quantum analog\r\nof Shannon's famous expression for the capacity of a noisy channel.\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed activity rests on the potential\r\napplications of\r\nquantum information theory in physics and computer science, and ultimately in\r\ntechnology.\r\n\r\n",
