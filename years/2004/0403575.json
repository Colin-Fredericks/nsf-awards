 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research project will follow two main directions:\r\n(i). Principal-agent theory in continuous-time models with\r\napplications to the optimal compensation of company executives\r\nand fund managers.  (ii). Numerical methods for high-dimensional optimization problems,\r\nBackward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) and degenerate\r\n Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), with applications in\r\nFinance and Economics.  The planned research will\r\nmake the theory of optimal contracts more compatible with the\r\nmodern, more complex continuous-time models for financial markets by\r\nusing several different methods of stochastic control and optimization:\r\npartial differential equations approach, duality/martingale approach,\r\nand the Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equation approach.\r\nIt is also planned to extend the theory to the following cases in which the\r\ntime of the payoff is not necessarily fixed in advance.\r\nThe second part of the project includes extending the work on finding\r\nefficient numerical methods for solving high-dimensional stochastic\r\noptimization problems, FBSDEs and degenerate PDEs, and to work on\r\n the existence/uniqueness theory for FBSDEs. The standard numerical\r\nPDE methods do not work in high-dimensions. Instead, these problems will\r\nbe approached with a combination of  dynamic programming, Malliavin\r\n Calculus, nonparametric regression methods, and existing numerical\r\nmethods for  FBSDEs. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe first project is likely to have important applications to the question\r\nof how to compensate  company executives and fund managers in an optimal\r\nway. The current practice  for executive compensation is to grant\r\noptions as a part of the compensation package, but there is a lot of\r\nrecent discussion on whether this contributes\r\nto the manipulation of the company's stock by the executives, and also how\r\nthese options should be accounted for in terms of the company's expenses.\r\nThe research will address these issues and provide some answers in\r\nthe framework of our mathematical models. In particular, anaysis will be conducted\r\non whether some other forms of compensation, such as deferred\r\noptions (as is about to be implemented by several large U.S. companies),\r\n have advantages relative to the existing forms of compensation.\r\nThe second project is related to perhaps the\r\nhardest practical problem in quantitative finance: to solve\r\nhigh-dimensional optimization problems. The most famous example of\r\nthese is pricing high-dimensional American options.\r\nThe techniques that are commonly used today are not appropriate for more\r\ncomplex and realistic models of security prices that are becoming a\r\nstandard, due to the increased sophistication of market practitioners.\r\nThus, it is important to explore new analytical and computational methods\r\nfor this task.\r\n",
