 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artificial Intelligence research has made limited progress towards computational understanding of human reasoning: we have failed to emphasize the creation of programs with \"resourcefulness\" in the face of unfamiliar problems. In computing theory and applications the emphasis has largely been on specific algorithms and mathematical techniques; complex systems have rarely yielded reproducible results or fundamental insights into a theory of system construction. Resourceful programs will require the application of multiple reasoning techniques, a layered architecture for coordinating activity whereby higher-order, reflective processes can diagnose failures in lower-order, deliberative processes.\r\n\r\nScenarios requiring \"commonsense reasoning\" provide an anvil of sufficient scope that only highly-resourceful programs will meet the requirements. Two projects support these aims: Roboverse establishes a virtual world where humanoid characters engage in complex, multi-realm scenarios, applying common sense to physical, social and mental activities; Panalogy is a specification for interconnect among multiple representations, combining diverse reasoning techniques such as analogy, case-based reasoning, statistical analysis and logical inference. An early version of Panalogy instantiates a set of meta-management components, demonstrating different ways to coordinate and repair baseline reasoning processes.\r\n\r\nThese resources enable wider research-community involvement by providing motivating demonstrations of new theoretical principles and evaluation tools and methodologies for experimental reproduction and comparison. We aim, through workshops, publications and direct engagement to encourage broader support from corporate and governmental sources. This increased effort in resourceful computing research leads the way towards programs that engage readily with humans in the search for solutions to complex problems of importance to science and society.\r\n",
