 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I research project will develop a tool for enhancing physical security operations at large facilities using a novel map-centered interface for video surveillance. The interface will incorporate \"perceptual filtering\" with automatic detection, tracking and behavior analysis of people using computer vision along with user-specified rules. This Monitoring Aid for Physical Security (MAPS) system will allow the security operator to maintain a high degree of situational awareness and to add capabilities for timely intervention. Phase I research will help in establishing the feasibility of the MAPS concept with the help of a laboratory prototype. \r\nThe research results generated from this project will help in better coupling human capabilities with those of automated computer vision analysis in order to improve current video surveillance systems, impacting several types of public places. Homeland security efforts include protecting the economic infrastructure (for example, 95% of U.S. commerce goes through the nation's 360 ports) and enabling a more effective crisis management response. Additional security efforts are aimed at airports and public transportation terminals and theft prevention in the retail industry. This monitoring tool will aid the retail industry in reducing its over $25 billion annual loss to employee theft and shoplifting. Other beneficiaries include schools and office building owners and users. \r\n",
