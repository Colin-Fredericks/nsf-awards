 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigator has developed tools for dimensional reduction and homogenization in nonlinear\r\nproblems based on the Mori-Zwanzig formalism of irreversible statistical mechanics.\r\nHe plans to use these methods, and if needed to extend them, in the following problems:\r\n1. Reduce the number of effective variables (in effect, perform an approximate\r\nmarginalization) in the evaluation of the proposal distribution in a sequential\r\nMonte-Carlo implementation of the Bayesian filter for data assimilation.\r\n2. Formulate effective  block Monte-Carlo methods, with applications \r\nto the motion of biological heteropolymers and to a Monte-Carlo implementation of\r\nthe Callen-Symanzik renormalization group for vortex-dominated phase transitions. \r\n3. Derive effective equations for multi-scale wave propagation problems. \r\n\r\nThe proposal has several components. The connecting thread is the use of methods the investigator\r\nhas previously developed for reducing the number of variables in a complex problem\r\nwhile leaving intact its salient statistical features. \r\n\r\nThe first component is the filtering/data assimilation problem. Suppose you have a\r\ncomplex system with some randomness and you make a forecast about its behavior\r\nat a future time ( for example, you make a weather forecast). Then new information comes\r\nin (for example, you open the window and you see that contrary to your forecast, \r\nit's raining).  How do you incorporate this new information into your forecast?\r\nIn principle this can be done by a creating on the computer a collection of replicas \r\nof the system and then modifying the distribution of the replicas with the help of the\r\nnew observations, but this is in general far too expensive in practice. The investigator's  \r\nprevious work makes it possible in principle to reduce the cost of such algorithms\r\nby a considerable factor, but it is still unknown whether this reduction is sufficient\r\nto make them practical. The investigator proposes to find out.\r\n\r\nAnother component is the study of the mutual attraction of disordered\r\nheteropolymers. It has been proposed by biologists that such heteropolymers\r\nattract each other when the probability densities of the distribution of \r\nparticular molecules on each fit in a statistical sense, even when the averaged \r\ninteraction is zero, and that this happens for example when the immune system identifies\r\ninvading viruses. To check this hypothesis on the computer leads to very large \r\ncomputational tasks which the investigator thinks he can simplify.\r\n\r\nA further component comes from theoretical physics. The vortex unbinding transition is\r\nimportant in many problems ( for example in the theory of thin films) but more\r\nimportantly it is a basic paradigm in quantum field theory. In earlier work with O. Hald\r\nthe investigator has shown that present theory is incomplete and pointed out several paradoxes.\r\nTo understand what is going on requires a calculation which has been until now too large\r\nto be successfully completed, but the new methods open the possibility that it can\r\nbe brought to completion, and the investigator proposes to try.  \r\n\r\n",
