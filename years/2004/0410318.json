 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is for development of an effective hp-adaptive First-Order\r\nSystem Least-Squares (FOSLS) method for nonlinear partial differential\r\nequations (PDEs) that may exhibit singularities and other non-smoothness \r\nproperties. The general FOSLS methodology is already a powerful tool for\r\nthe solution of PDE-based problems in science and engineering. One of its\r\nmain advantages is that it can be used to transform a given set of\r\nequations into a loosely coupled system of scalar equations that can be\r\ntreated easily by multilevel finite elements. The reformulation is done\r\nby recasting the equations as a least-squares principle associated \r\nwith a carefully derived first-order system. Another advantage of FOSLS is\r\nthat the associated functional itself provides a natural sharp local error\r\nestimator, which can be employed for effective adaptive refinement. In\r\nprevious work, the FOSLS methodology was developed and analyzed for\r\nproblems that include linear elasticity, linear transport, and\r\nincompressible fluid dynamics. Under standard H2-type smoothness\r\nassumptions on the original PDE, FOSLS has been proved theoretically \r\nand numerically to exhibit optimal finite element and multigrid\r\nconvergence  properties. However, two principal difficulties currently\r\nprevent FOSLS from being applied effectively to more complicated problems:\r\nnonsmooth solutions and nonlinearity. The project aim is to develop an\r\nadaptive weighted-functional coupled with adaptive nested iteration\r\nschemes to treat these difficulties. The goal is to obtain a scheme that\r\ncan solve complex nonlinear PDE systems with a total cost equivalent to a \r\nsmall number of relaxation steps on the finest grid.\r\n\r\nSuccessful completion of this project will enhance our ability to model\r\ncomplex physical processes on high-end computing platforms. In particular,\r\nthis project addresses computational models of coupled fluid/structure\r\ninteractions that occur, for example, in biomechanical systems such as\r\nblood flow in compliant vessels. Other areas that could potentially\r\nbenefit from this project are aerodynamics, astrophysics, geophysics and\r\nmeteorology. As modern computer architectures become more complex,\r\nharnessing 10s of thousands of processors working together on a single,\r\ncomplex problem, it becomes even more important to develop optimal\r\nnumerical algorithms. Successful completion of this project will widen the\r\nclass of problems for which optimal algorithms exist.\r\n",
