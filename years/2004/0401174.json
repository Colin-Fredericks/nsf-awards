Research of this type is\r\nfundamental in the understanding of many physical and geometrical problems.\r\nMany aspects of natural phenomena are related to each other by the natural\r\nlaws governing them and very often these relations are mathematically\r\ndescribed by differential or integral equations. The study of these equations\r\nis very important in understanding the related phenomena. It is often the case\r\nthat to solve differential equations computationally with sufficient accuracy,\r\nthe most effective and economical way is to exploit the properties of\r\nsolutions of the equations and then to develop algorithms in accordance.\r\nBesides being very useful in applied science, the study of various kinds of\r\nstructures and properties of solutions to various types of equations\r\ninvariably leads to new research endeavors.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn particular, the PI's will continue the development of a class of very\r\npowerful techniques, namely the Method of Moving Planes for both differential\r\nand integral equations or systems, to the calssification and quantization of\r\nsolutions to various fundamental systems of equations, to the study of local\r\nasymptotic symmetry of singular solutions and a priori estimates of solutions.\r\nThe PI will also continue the joint work with W. Chen on the geometric problem\r\nof finding a conformal metric with a prescribed Gaussian or scalar curvature.\r\nThe PI is also involved in the study of certain parabolic systems arising form\r\nother branches of sciences. The center problem the PI will study is the\r\nfundamental Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequalities including the weighted\r\nversion of them. These inequalities are the most important ingredients in the\r\nstudy of Sobolev spaces and are extremely important in the study of nonlinear\r\nelliptic and parabolic partial differential equations. The first task will be\r\nthe classification of all regular critical points of the functional associated\r\nwith these inequalities. The second is to study the singular critical points.\r\nFurther developing the method of moving planes in both differential and\r\nintegral forms is essential for making progress in the above two tasks and is\r\ninteresting in its own.\r\n\r\n",
