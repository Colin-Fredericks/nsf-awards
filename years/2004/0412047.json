 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ruan\r\n\r\nThe investigator studies the effect of spatial heterogeneity,\r\nnonlocal interactions and time delay on the spatiotemporal\r\ndynamics of epidemiological and ecological models.  Three\r\nparticular examples are considered.  The first is the generalized\r\nRoss-Macdonald vector-host (malaria) models.  The focus here is\r\non the existence of traveling waves in a vector disease model\r\ndescribed by diffusive integrodifferential equations with delay\r\nand the effects of nonlocal interaction and time delay on the\r\nepidemic waves and spatiotemporal dynamics.  The effects of\r\nspatial heterogeneity and time delay on the establishment and\r\ntransmission of the disease are studied by considering a\r\nmulti-patch model.  The second is nosocomial epidemic models with\r\nantibiotic resistance and infection age.  Persistence and\r\nextinction of the infected population are considered.  The impact\r\nof control measures such as isolation of patients infected with\r\nresistant strains, restricted use of antibiotics, and reduced or\r\nextended hospital stays, are discussed in terms of the model\r\nparameters.  The third is the biological and physical\r\nnutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ) models.  The\r\ninvestigator studies spatiotemporal dynamics such as traveling\r\nwaves and chaotic mixing in the advective-diffusive NPZ models.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important environmental effects of globalization\r\nis the dramatic increase in the introduction of exotic species,\r\nincluding pathogens that may cause disease in humans, into new\r\nregions.  Such introductions can lead to biological invasions,\r\nwhich in turn can threaten public health or affect ecosystem\r\nstructure.  Examples include nonindigenous vectors that arrive,\r\nestablish, and spread in new areas and foment epidemics of human\r\ndiseases such as malaria, yellow fever, typhus, plague, and West\r\nNile virus.  The investigator studies the spatial transmission of\r\ncertain vector-host diseases such as malaria and hopes that the\r\nstudy can help to understand the establishment and spread of\r\nother vector-borne diseases such as West Nile.  He also studies\r\nnosocomial epidemics with antibiotic resistance, aiming to\r\nprovide some control measures to combat such epidemics inside\r\nhospitals.  Finally, he examines the spatiotemporal dynamics of\r\nplankton populations; this may lead to a better understanding of\r\nglobal issues such as the depletion of ocean fish markets and the\r\ngreenhouse effect.\r\n",
