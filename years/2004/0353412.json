 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Nurturing Mathematics Dreamkeepers\" is a  five-year Teacher Professional Continuum Research project that seeks to study a professional development intervention for K-2 teachers centered on standards-based, culturally-relevant pedagogy aimed at improving the mathematical performance of African-American students.  The study targets ten elementary schools in an urban school district with a documented achievement gap between White American and African American students.  The research study will investigate:  (a) the  ways in which K-2 teachers draw upon their current knowledge (mathematical, cultural, pedagogical) to make sense of African American students' conceptions; (b) how teachers might advance their practice through understanding of the relationship between students' cultural experiences and mathematical conceptions; and (c) to what extent does this advancement bring forth solid foundations in mathematics among all students.\r\n\r\nThe project will yield four major outcomes.  First, the project will influence mathematics achievement for approximately 1,000 African American K-2 students.  Second, it will provide an empirically grounded knowledge base and model of how teacher learning can impact the achievement gap.  Third, the creation of a cadre of mentor mathematics teachers and school administrators prepared to support quality mathematics teaching and learning will enhance infrastructure in the school districts served.  Finally, the project will nurture five graduate students who will become highly qualified mathematics teacher educators as a result of the project.\r\n\r\nThe professional development includes annual two-week summer institutes and extensive follow-up support during the school year.  Close to 300 elementary school teachers and principals are targeted by this K-2 mathematics project.  During the academic year, buddy-pairs of teachers will co-teach mathematics lessons, hold a weekly two-hour reflective sessions and participate in a weekly cohort session focused on teachers' pedagogical concerns.  The teacher buddy-pairs will increase each year creating a learning community at each school.  The learning community will meet each week at the school site.  Professional development content will focus on number sense within the context of conception-based, culturally relevant pedagogy.  Cultural relevant pedagogy will be examined theoretically to allow teachers to develop new awareness and practice of its principles to facilitate student success in mathematics.\r\n\r\nThe research design employs a case-controlled, quasi-experimental study utilizing mixed methods.  Over a two-year period, five schools representing two cohorts of participants will receive \"first order\" professional development from the project.  Over the course of the third year, a \"second order\" autonomous professional development experience will involve five additional schools in the same school district.  Another five additional schools in which no teacher participates in the project will serve as comparison.  Data sources include videotapes of classroom practice, videotapes of professional development sessions, teacher surveys, case studies, mini-interviews of students and written assessments for students in grades 1-2.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
