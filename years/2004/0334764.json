They propose to collaborate on issues related to XML (Extended Markup Language) technology, the standard for data exchange on the Worldwide Web.\r\n\r\nIncreased interaction of databases, XML and Web services raises new challenges in database research.  One central issue, addressed in this project, is the development of static analysis techniques to increase confidence in the robustness and correctness of complex Web services, and to enhance function and efficiency.  The objective of this project is to cooperate with the French group on new static analysis and algorithmic techniques for XML-based Web services.  They will apply these techniques to various Web services and investigate aspects related to repositories with incomplete information about XML documents, and query processing on streaming XML documents.  \r\n\r\nThe French GEMO team is recognized for pioneering work in the area of semi-structured data and XML.  Their work resulted in the formation of Xyleme, a European spin-off, start-up company, focusing on XML technology.  Their expertise complements the U.S. team's theoretical research.  Their joint efforts will further understanding of XML technology and its application in web-based services and database development. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n",
