The main focus of the project is a program to solve\r\nThurston's Ending Lamination Conjecture, which states that a\r\nhyperbolic 3-manifold is uniquely determined by its topological type\r\nand a list of invariants describing the asymptotic geometry of its\r\nends. This conjecture is central in the field and would settle a\r\nnumber of outstanding questions about the structure of the deformation\r\nspace of all hyperbolic structures on a given manifold.  The principal\r\ntool in this approach is the Complex of Curves, a combinatorial object\r\nwhich describes the set of all essential homotopy classes of simple\r\nloops on a given surface.  Such a complex, viewed as a metric space,\r\nis hyperbolic in the sense of Cannon and Gromov, and the invariants\r\nwhich describe the geometry of a 3-manifold turn out to be \"points at\r\ninfinity\" for the complex. A study of geodesics within the complex of\r\ncurves then allows us to construct a model for the geometry of the\r\n3-manifold which depends only on its end invariants.  Part of the\r\nprogram is joint work with Brock and Canary.  The complex of curves is\r\nalso instrumental in studying the Teichmuller space of hyperbolic\r\nstructures on a surface, and its symmetry group, known as the Mapping\r\nClass Group. Hyperbolicity of the complex implies a type of relative\r\nhyperbolicity property for the Teichmuller space and the Mapping Class\r\nGroup, and in collaboration with Brock and Masur, Minsky hopes to\r\napply this to study the geometric properties of Teichmuller space, and\r\nto answer a number of group-theoretic and algorithmic questions about\r\nthe mapping class group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTopological spaces appear in mathematics at varying levels of\r\nabstraction. The earth, for example, can be thought of as a sphere,\r\nspinning around its axis. The set of all positions of this sphere,\r\nperhaps as parameterized by the time of day in New York, can itself be\r\nvisualized as a circle.  The positions of the earth in its orbit\r\naround the sun also make up a circle, and all this information\r\ntogether can be described by a 2-dimensional surface, called a torus,\r\nso that each point in the torus corresponds to exactly one position of\r\nthe earth-sun system, and our motion in space gives rise to a\r\ntrajectory winding around the torus.  Once a surface is being studied,\r\nwe often give it various structures: it can have a metric, which is a\r\nway of measuring distance in it; it can also be filled up in different\r\nways by loops. The set of all possible metrics can itself be studied\r\nas a \"space\", where motion in this space corresponds to changing\r\nshapes of the surface. The set of all loops in the surface gives\r\nrise to another space, of a more combinatorial character.  A\r\nfascinating phenomenon, not uncommon in mathematics, is the appearance\r\nof analogies between these different levels of abstraction. For\r\nexample, a property of a single metric on a surface called \"hyperbolicity\"\r\nappears again, in another guise, as a property of the space of all\r\nmetrics on the surface and the space of all loops. The interaction\r\nbetween these different levels yields interesting phenomena and tools\r\nwhich can be applied to solve a number of problems in\r\n",
