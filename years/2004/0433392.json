 "awd_abstract_narration": "The local infrasound environment in Alaska is rich in both natural and human-generated sources.   Identifying the source and localizing it is a challenge with many different applications.  The Infrasound group at UAF has operated arrays in Alaska and Antarctica for several years. The primary arrays are comprised of eight microphones arranged to obtain wide-band operation with no spatial aliasing over the frequency band of interest. These arrays are operated and maintained by the UAF group as part of the International Monitoring System (IMS) of the United Nations Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Office (CTBTO).  A second array of four microphones is operated by the UAF group as a research array. The group has used this array to test methods of wind-noise reduction, microphone performance and array performance under varying array geometries.  As part of the process of identifying infrasound signal sources a prototype locator algorithm was developed that allows estimation of the range to the signal source for locations of the signals source of up to 10 to 15 times the array diameter. The locator algorithm has been used extensively in cases where signal-to-noise levels are high and it appears to be robust. Investigators will continue to study the method and investigate its behavior under a range of signal-to-noise conditions, as well as develop an estimator of the variance in the estimates of range and azimuth.  \r\n\r\nThe description and classification of signal sources will improve the ability to discriminate against known natural and man-made sources in signal detection operations. The development of an algorithm to estimate source range to accompany the traditional azimuth estimates will also benefit the general area of source localization using acoustic methods. This algorithm should be transferable to any detection program using arrays of sensors.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The dominant event of the decade was the infrasound associated with the great Denali earthquake of 2002.  We were able to trace the location of the epicenter as it moved eastward along the Alaska Range.  The acoustic signals were attributed to the lateral motion of the mountain range as the epicenter moved past.(1) A new discovery was made in the analysis of long-period waves associated with auroral activity.(2) This topic is now the subject of a PhD thesis.\n\nAt the McMurdo site we regularly observe the eruptions of Mt Erebus, located some 30km from our array.

This algorithm was developed by our group and, after extensive testing and development, has received a patent.(4) The basis of the algorithm is the use of the time-of-arrival of a signal wave front at each sensor in an array.  With this information the kinematic equations of motion can be solved to identify a unique source location.  We have carried out extensive simulations and a complete field test to validate the results.(5) The field tests were conducted at Fort Greely, Alaska using three small arrays of microphones spaced approximately 3km from each other. Army personnel set of a large number of explosions at random locations in and near the area where the arrays were located.  The resulting data were..."
