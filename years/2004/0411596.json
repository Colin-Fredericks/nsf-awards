 "awd_abstract_narration": "USA-Sweden Collaborative Workshop in Algebraic Combinatorics\r\n\r\nThe Mittag-Leffler Institute in Djursholm, Sweden, will devote the\r\n spring of 2005 to a special program entitled \"Algebraic\r\n Combinatorics.\" On the occasion of this program, we propose to\r\n organize a collaborative research experience for young researchers\r\n from Sweden and the US. We request funds to support the participation\r\n of six young researchers from the US for two to three months each in\r\n this collaborative workshop. This workshop will provide a unique\r\n opportunity for these young mathematicians to develop collaborations\r\n with their counterparts from Sweden, as well as with leaders in the\r\n field from Scandanavia, Western Europe, and Asia. In the long term the\r\n workshop will increase the potential for these young mathematicians to\r\n become leading researchers in algebraic combinatorics and related\r\n areas.\r\n\r\n The theme of the program will be the interaction between combinatorics\r\n and such other branches of mathematics as algebra, geometry, and\r\n topology.  At least 28 of the world's leading researchers in algebraic\r\n combinatorics have agreed to participate in the program for at least\r\n one month each. Topics that will be investigated during the program\r\n include classical enumerative combinatorics (e.g., the\r\n Mills-Robbins-Rumsey conjectures, statistics on finite and affine\r\n Coxeter groups), convex polytopes (boundary structure, flag f-vectors,\r\n diameters, Charney-Davis conjecture, applications to computational\r\n algebra, minimal triangulations), and connections with algebra\r\n (outgrowths of the n! conjecture, Schubert and Grothendieck\r\n polynomials, ribbon tableaux).\r\n",
