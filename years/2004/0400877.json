 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract of DMS 0400877\r\nPI: Douglas Ulmer\r\n\r\nDr. Ulmer proposes to work on three projects ultimately related to the\r\narithmetic of abelian varieties over function fields.  In the first\r\nproject, he plans to prove that there exist abelian varieties of\r\narbitrary dimension whose L-functions vanish to arbitrarily high order\r\nat the center of their critical strips.  This generalizes his previous\r\nwork on elliptic curves.  In the second and third projects, he plans\r\nto generalize his previous construction of local points on the\r\nuniversal elliptic curve over a modular curve to the context of an\r\narbitrary non-isotrivial elliptic curve over a function field and to\r\nstudy the extent to which this construction may be used to construct\r\nglobal points.  This research is intimately connected with the\r\nconjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer in the function field context.\r\n\r\nDr. Ulmer works in the general area of Arithmetical Algebraic\r\nGeometry, an area of fundamental mathematics that was previously\r\nthought to be beyond application.  However, it is now known to be of\r\ncrucial importance to many important technologies, such as coding\r\ntheory and cryptography, which affect our everyday lives.  CD and DVD\r\nplayers, mobile telephones, and secure internet communication all rely\r\non mathematics originally created in the pursuit of\r\nquestions in arithmetical algebraic geometry.  The field also has deep\r\nand mysterious links to other areas of science such as quantum field\r\ntheory.  Dr. Ulmer's work does not appear to have immediate\r\napplication, but his knowledge of this area provides a broad\r\nperspective on modern mathematics and forms the basis for many\r\neducation, outreach, and training activities which he is engaged in.\r\nThese include the Southwestern Center for Arithmetical Algebraic\r\nGeometry, initiatives in training and mentoring of new graduate\r\nstudents, and numerous undergraduate research projects.\r\n",
