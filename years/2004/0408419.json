Perry, University of Kentucky\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project involves inverse spectral and scattering theory in three areas\r\nof mathematical investigation: (1) the spectral theory of two-step\r\nnilpotent groups and compact nilmanifolds, (2) the inverse resonance problem for\r\nexterior domains and scattering manifolds, and (3) inverse scattering for\r\nsingular potentials with applications to nonlinear dispersive equations.\r\nTwo-step nilpotent lie groups play an important role in pure mathematics as \r\nmodels of sub-Riemannian geometry and as a rich source of examples of\r\nmanifolds with identical Laplace spectra but distinct geometries; a\r\ndetailed investigation of the trace formula for these manifolds will be\r\ncarried out using analysis on nilpotent Lie groups. Resonances are\r\ndiscrete scattering data for non-compact manifolds analogous to the\r\neigenvalues of the Laplacian on a compact manifold; the inverse resonance\r\nproblem will be investigated in the contexts of conformal and\r\nasymptotically flat geometries, and invariants such as the determinant will\r\nbe studied. Nonlinear dispersive equations with singular initial data may\r\nbe viewed, via the inverse scattering method, as linearized flows for the\r\nscattering data of a very singular potential. We hope to extend the inverse\r\nscattering picture for the KdV and mKdV equations to such singular data and\r\nobtain greater insight into these dynamical systems--by constructing the\r\nflow on Hilbert spaces of initial data which are singular but very natural\r\nfrom a dynamical point of view.  \r\n\r\nInverse spectral theory is the mathematical discipline that\r\nunderlies important applications of mathematics to medical imaging,\r\ngeophysical prospection, non-destructive testing, and many other areas.\r\nIn these applications, properties of a physical\r\nsystem (a human body, the earth, or an industrial material) are \r\ndeduced from its response to externally imposed stimuli (electromagnetic\r\nradiation, seismic waves, or ultrasound). The properties deduced may \r\nloosely be described as the \"geometry\" of the system and its response \r\nto external stimuli the \"spectral data\" (or \"normal\r\nmodes\"). A deep result of the study of completely integrable systems is \r\nthat certain physical phenomena,  such as the propagation of waves in\r\nshallow water, can be solved using an associated inverse spectral problem.\r\nThus advances in inverse spectral theory lead to a better understanding of\r\nhow such nonlinear waves propagate.  The impact of this project will be \r\ntwofold: first, it will elucidate, by studying carefully chosen geometric \r\ncontexts, the relation between speectrum and geometry. Secondly, it will \r\ndeepen our understanding of nonlinear dispersive waves by extending tools \r\nof inverse scattering theory to study nonlinear wave propagation with \r\nvery singular waves. \r\n\r\n",
