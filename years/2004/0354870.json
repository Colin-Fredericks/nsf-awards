 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intellectual Merit\r\nOne of the frontier areas of nuclear physics involves the study of the structure of the nuclei\r\nof atoms which are very dierent from the stable nuclei that represent matter as we know it.\r\nThese nuclei are unstable and have to be produced in dedicated accelerators. In nuclei in general,\r\nthe excitations of individual nucleons from one energy level to another are expected to change\r\nas a function of the constituent number of protons or neutrons. The characteristics of any one\r\nsingle nucleon, whether proton or neutron, can be probed by reactions in which individual nucleons\r\nare transferred from one nucleus to another during a collision. Reactions in which a neutron is\r\ntransferred will be studied at relatively low energies with rare isotope beams of nuclei that contain a\r\nlarge number of neutrons. These studies can only be carried out with beams such as those produced\r\nat the Holield Radioactive Ion Beam Facility (HRIBF) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\r\nAnother challenge in nuclear physics aims at understanding the excitations of nuclei far-from-\r\nstability as a function of energy and angular momentum. The second focus of this proposal will\r\naddress, via measurements of magnetic properties, the microscopic structure of excited states.\r\nThese studies will impact on the understanding of the interactions between nucleons, and will\r\nilluminate the interplay of individual particles with the underlying spherical or deformed nuclear\r\ncores. New techniques involving bombarding light nuclei with heavier ones have been developed\r\nand tested with radioactive beams. The method will now be applied at HRIBF.\r\nBroader Impacts.\r\nThe structure of the proposed activities is designed to have as large as possible an impact on the\r\neducation and training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as postdoctoral associates.\r\nThe project will also serve to enhance the diversity of the nuclear science workforce by including\r\nearly career scientists who are women or come from other under-represented backgrounds. The\r\nparticipation of these early career scholars in the forefront research would prepare them for careers\r\nin education and basic and applied research, in national laboratories and industry.\r\nThe nuclear physics results are also of importance in astronomy, to understand the abundance\r\nof elements observed in the galaxy, condensed matter physics, to understand the microscopic com-\r\nponents of the transient hyperfine, and national security, to understand properties of and\r\nreactions on fission fragments.\r\n",
