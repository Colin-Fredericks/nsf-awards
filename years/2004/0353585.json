The Consortium has been a fundamental component of the undergraduate-research landscape over the last seventeen years, supporting 909 undergraduate students from eighty-three schools across the nation.  In addition to research projects, the Consortium program includes the annual Keck Research Symposium in Geology.  \r\nThe symposium is a gathering place for some of the most talented and motivated undergraduate students in the nation.  For the students, the symposium is a place to present research results in an environment that emphasizes the importance of communication and builds self-confidence. For the faculty, the symposium is an opportunity to interact and share information with each \r\nother, stimulating development of new collaborations and innovative programs.  \r\n\r\n This award will is to continue the Keck Geology Consortium in order to capitalize and build on the seventeen-year experience of the Keck Geology Consortium in collaboration, design, and administration of undergraduate research projects.  \r\n\r\nThe REU site will serve as the platform for a systematic assessment study to produce a web-based assessment library that can be adapted by the geoscience community to inform the development and practice of teaching undergraduate research. \r\n",
