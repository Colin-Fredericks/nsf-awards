 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many animal cells have the ability to crawl or glide over\r\nlong distance on a surface.  For decades, scientists have been\r\ntrying to understand the mechanics of such movement.  This is\r\nimportant because cell movement is fundamental to many important\r\nbiological processes such as the formation and development of an\r\nembryo, wound healing, and proper functioning of the immune\r\nsystem.  The investigator and colleagues develop a mathematical\r\nmodel of cell movement based on well established physical and\r\nbiological principles. With such a model, testable prediction\r\nabout any particular aspect of cell movement that is being\r\nmodeled can be made.  One can also examine the contribution of\r\neach sub-process of cell movement by altering the appropriate\r\nparameters in the model, something which is not possible to do by\r\nexperiments.  A good mathematical model can help cell biologists\r\nbetter understand the principles of cell movement which will in\r\nturn help doctors and people in the medical field improve their\r\ntreatment of certain types of diseases.\r\n\r\n     Existing models of cell motility are either one-dimensional,\r\nmeaning that they only focus on a vertical strip in the middle of\r\nthe cell, or they are spatially discrete models.  A\r\none-dimensional model is inadequate because the cell can only\r\nhave length but no shape.  It is also known that certain protein\r\nfilaments, which are cross-linked to form the cytoskeleton of the\r\ncell that is responsible for cell movement, are oriented\r\ndifferently at different parts of the cell.  A spatially discrete\r\nmodel is difficult to analyze mathematically because of the large\r\nnumber of equations involved. The model the investigator and his\r\ncolleagues develop is a two-dimensional continuum model that\r\nrequires more sophisticated analytical and computational\r\ntechniques.  Methods of study involve biological experiments to\r\ndetermine the movement of cell boundary, development of the\r\nmathematical model using mechanics principles, analytical and\r\nnumerical studies of the resulting equations, and comparisons and\r\nreconciliations of the analytical, numerical and experimental\r\nresults.\r\n",
