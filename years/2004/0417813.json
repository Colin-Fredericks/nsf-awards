 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of this project is to gain a broader understanding of how multiple  contexts in which individuals interact influence political behavior and attitudes. By drawing  upon and adapting work from community psychology the research questions in this project ask  1) from where does an individual get his/her sense of community --does it come from one, two,  or multiple contexts? and 2) how does sense of community influence political behaviors and  attitudes such as participation, tolerance, community satisfaction, and political knowledge?  For  example, people might have a sense of community from their neighborhoods or their workplaces  but they may also have a sense of community from belonging to an organization or a church.   Attention to where this sense of community develops and how much variation exists within each  context are critical to broadening our understanding of how to model the process of how, why,  and when social forces influence individuals. attitudes and behaviors.  Does sense of community  enhance participation, foster tolerance, lead to greater community satisfaction, increased trust,  and produce more interest in local governance?   Original data from a random group of citizens  in Tallahassee, Florida will be collected to address these questions.    \r\n\r\n  Intellectual Merit    In recent years, academic research in the social sciences rightly has paid increasing  attention to the impact of social context on the behaviors and attitudes of the individuals.   Unfortunately, this research has approached the concept of .context. quite narrowly, most often  merely identifying a single context per individual, with little or no information included  regarding the nature of the person's actions within that context.  By drawing on insights from the  work in the field of community psychology, the proposed project promises a significant  intellectual advance.  First, the process underlying contextual effects can be modeled with  considerably more nuance and sophistication than has been typical in past research, potentially  bringing a much richer understanding of the interplay between individuals and the contexts in  which they are embedded.  Second, by demonstrating the relevance of research in community  psychology for questions examined in political science, this project will exemplify the benefits of  interdisciplinary research. Findings will help strengthen theoretical advancements in community  psychology by establishing how well those theories .travel,. and use of those theories will bring  a stronger, more rigorous foundation to substantive social science research in this area.    \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts    Generally speaking, social scientists agree that community influences individual behavior  and attitudes.  This project takes an interdisciplinary approach to understanding how multiple  contexts in which individuals interact influence their behaviors and attitudes by combining  elements of political science, sociology, and community psychology research. As community  leaders and local policymakers attempt to meet the needs of their citizens and promote  democratic values within their cities it is critical that they have a broader understanding of how  social forces (particularly  ommunity) influence individuals. behaviors and attitudes.    \r\n",
