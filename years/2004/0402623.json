 "awd_abstract_narration": "HOUSTON LOUIS STOKES ALLIANCE FOR MINORITY PARTICIPATION.PHASE II \r\n \r\nThe Houston-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (H-LSAMP) consortium consisting of 6 \r\nuniversities, 2 community colleges, and a school district, will build upon its Phase I foundation to \r\nimplement a realistic, comprehensive plan to:  a) recruit well-qualified minority students in STEM \r\ndisciplines; b) enhance retention rates by focusing on individual retention issues, and; c) ensure that \r\neach student graduates with a clear career goal and the preparation to achieve it.  The H-LSAMP will \r\nmaintain its management structure, its recruitment and selection process, and will continue to provide \r\nfinancial support in the form of stipends to its H-LSAMP scholars.  Scholars will earn their stipends by \r\nperforming activities associated with their training, such as working in research laboratories.  The H-\r\nLSAMP will maintain its successful Collaborative Learning Community model in which scholars are \r\nrequired to attend rigorous excellence workshops associated with core courses such as calculus and \r\nchemistry.  \r\n \r\nAdditionally, the H-LSAMP will implement processes to educate the scholars about career opportunities \r\nopen to well-prepared graduates, and monitor and counsel them to optimize the likelihood of on-time \r\ngraduation. Strong emphasis will be placed on encouraging students to pursue graduate degrees and \r\npreparing them for entry to graduate school.  To this end, the H-LSAMP will plan and execute regularly \r\nscheduled workshops and forums about STEM careers and graduate education, emphasizing the \r\nleadership opportunities open to those with doctoral degrees in these fields.  The H-LSAMP will \r\nrespond to the need for improved communication skills by providing formal written communications \r\nskills training.  Concurrently, a protocol for routine monitoring and documenting student progress that \r\nincludes periodic individual assessment and follow-up meetings with a staff member will be designed \r\nand employed.  The H-LSAMP will contribute to the growing body of knowledge about retention of \r\nundergraduate minority STEM students by using accepted research methods to determine the relative \r\ncontributions of factors believed to be important to retention in this population.  Last, because \r\ninformation management is important to the success of programs such as the LSAMP, a state-of-the-art \r\ninformation management software program developed specifically for the H-LSAMP will be made \r\navailable to other institutions.     \r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies primarily in the generation of important new knowledge about \r\nfactors that contribute to retention and success in the population of underrepresented minorities, \r\nprimarily Hispanics and African-Americans pursuing STEM baccalaureate degrees in Texas.  One can \r\nreasonably expect much of this knowledge to be generalizable to Hispanics and African-Americans in \r\nother geographic areas of the U.S.  Once the results of an innovative student-centered plan that combines \r\napplication of educational principles with a standardized counseling and monitoring protocol are known, \r\nthe educational community will have a model for assessing and responding to needs of individual \r\nminority STEM students as they progress through their college careers.  The commitment of the H-\r\nLSAMP leaders, faculty, and staff is well-documented, and evidence of institutionalization of the \r\nprogram includes the commitment of physical facilities and an institutional to NSF match of \r\napproximately 1.5:1.     \r\n  \r\nThe broader impact of this project lies in its potential to greatly increase the numbers of well-focused, \r\nminority graduates who graduate from our institutions inspired and prepared to pursue career goals. The \r\nexpectation is that a high proportion will aspire to attend graduate school, swelling the ranks of the next \r\ngeneration of scientific leaders and educators.  Finally, the H-LSAMP will have the potential to enhance \r\nthe success and impact of similar programs by making available proprietary software that facilitates the \r\ndata collection, retrieval, analysis, and reporting required for effective, efficient operation.  \r\n",
