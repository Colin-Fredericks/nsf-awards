 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recognition of the roles of halogen chemistry and elucidation of the details for various atmospheric environments has been important in improving understanding of a number of processes including ozone depletion in the stratosphere and in the Arctic boundary layer.  In the troposphere, the understanding of detailed mechanisms for halogen production and the implications of the presence of halogens, in addition to other oxidants, is not complete and requires further study.  This collaborative project involving researchers from four institutions will examine the role of halogen chemistry in the polluted outflow plume off the coast of the northeast U.S.  In particular, the influence of halogen chemistry on the ozone budget, on nighttime radical chemistry, on aerosol production and evolution, and on the interaction of the pollution plume with marine boundary layer chemical and physical processes.  This will be accomplished by a comprehensive suite of analytical instrumentation measuring important quantities during an observation phase of the study in the summer of 2004, followed by detailed analysis of these observations.  \r\n\r\nThis project will take advantage of, and contribute to, the multiple field campaigns taking place in the summer of 2004 under the umbrella of the International Consortium for Research on Transport and Transformation (ICARTT).  This will encourage synergy between the field programs sponsored by NASA (Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment, INTEX-A), NOAA (New England Air Quality Study - Intercontinental Transport and Chemical Transformation, NEAQS - ITCT 2004), and European agencies (Intercontinental Transport of Pollution, ITOP).  In addition, the AIRMAP (Atmospheric Investigation, Regional Modeling and Prediction) program at the University of New Hampshire is enhancing measurement sites on coastal islands to contribute to this effort.\r\n\r\nIn addition to improving understanding of halogen chemical processes in the lower atmosphere, thus leading to enhanced ability to predict future changes in the atmosphere, this project will also train graduate and undergraduate students and strengthen the partnership between the participating institutions.  There will also be significant public outreach activities.",
