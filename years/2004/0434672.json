Understanding the mechanisms that may lead to species diversification in tropical forests has intrigued biologists for more than a century and has important implications for tropical conservation. Using molecular methods it is possible to predict what signatures of genetic variation might underlie different diversification scenarios and distinguish between them. In particular, the role of ecological gradients, tropical forest \"refuges\" and river barriers in promoting speciation have been hotly debated. The purpose of this study is therefore to test alternative diversification hypotheses by comparing genetic variation across a suite of forest antelope species. In order to achieve the broad geographical sampling scheme required for this study, this project will make use of field collections of dung as a source of DNA. \r\n\r\nThe successful implementation of such a project depends heavily on the participation and cooperation of scientists at the partner institution in Gabon (CIRMF). Through the proposed collaboration, this project will stimulate exchange of expertise and knowledge between African and U.S. participants. CIRMF will also serve as an important base for coordinating sampling and networking with other collaborators within Central Africa. This study will not only provide important information on the origins of biological diversity in the Afro-tropics but will also provide a solid database of information on antelope species distributions. Most importantly, strengthening the mutual collaboration between the University of New Orleans and CIRMF will provide opportunities for two-way training, scientific exchange, and technology transfer between both U.S. and African scientists. \r\n",
