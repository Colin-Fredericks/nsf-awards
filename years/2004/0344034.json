 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural enemies are one of the major factors controlling the population size of insect pests. The minute parasitic wasps of the family Scelionidae attack and kill the eggs of other insects and spiders, including many pests of agricultural, forestry, medical, and veterinary importance.  Proper appreciation of the role that these wasps play in the natural control of insects and effective use of them as biological control agents relies on the ability of accurately identify them.  Scelionidae is a large group, with over 3,000 known species and perhaps as many as 10,000 in all. The goal of this project is to revise the existing classification of these wasps. This will be a worldwide study, encompassing over 200 genera.  The work will be based upon the extensive new material, hundreds of thousands of specimens, that has accumulated in the world's natural history collections over the past 25 years. The evolutionary history of the group will be analyzed using the techniques of phylogenetics so as to develop a predictive and stableclassification. The result of this analysis will also provide the scientific community with the framework within which to understand the biology and host relationships of these wasps. Modern information technologies, including relational databases, digital libraries, electronic identification tools, and image banks, will play a critical role in both the research and dissemination of results.\r\n\r\nHumans share the planet with millions of different species of plants, animals, fungi and microbes and depend on them for food, fiber, and a myriad of ecological services. Thousands of new species are discovered each year, each one of which has the potential for benefitting society. However, the number of people capable of recognizing and identifying these organisms decreases every year. Training in the study of biodiversity is an integral part of this project, and the work will involve substantive contributions from high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students. At a practical level, the results will significantly enhance the ability to identify these wasps and make use of them as a natural and ecologically safe method of pest control. The results of this study will be important in a broader scientific context through the development and implementation of a modern information infrastructure for the study of biodiversity. The public will have free access to all information on scelionids emerging from this project through the World Wide Web.\r\n\r\n",
