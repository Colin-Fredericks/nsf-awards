 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is developing, deploying, evaluating, and disseminating interactive learning modules (ILMs) and web-based educational technologies to help student learn the fundamentals of electrical engineering.  Investigators from three other universities, representing a minority institution, a four-year school, and an urban university, are participating in the project. The ILMs, which build on a prior prototype development project, support the \"key concepts\" of electrical engineering (i.e., areas associated with the PE and FE exams).  These ILMs provide illustrative supporting materials for engineering students that can be further used to stimulate interest in K-12 students to consider STEM careers.  Deployment also involves a faculty exchange program, allowing faculty partners to \"swap\" classrooms for a particular topic, and experience diverse teaching/learning environments.  Evaluation experts at a separate university will organize and carry out the evaluation.  The materials will be available on the Internet and on CDs and a major publisher has indicated interest in the product.  The project team plans a series of workshops.\r\n",
