 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Major Research Instrumentation program provides allow Texas State University (TxSU) to upgrade a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) system recently made available through private donation.  The modernization will enable sophisticated and user-friendly microbeam diffraction, high-sensitivity CCD camera imaging, and integrated elemental analysis capabilities that will introduce in a cost-effective way new capabilities for nanostructured materials characterization.  This is a critically needed instrument for  nanotechnology and nanoscience research TxSU. The instrument will benefit several departments, Chemistry, Engineering Technology and Physics, will benefit from this upgrade. It will enhance synergetic of the industrial, academic and international materials collaborations at the TxSU Nanomaterials Applications Center and the TxSU Institute for Environmental and Industrial Science. \r\nThe upgraded TEM will significantly address the materials analysis needs of an existing collaborative RUI project involving Tarleton State U, Angelo State U and TxSU.  It will be a \"hands on\" instrument in TxSU's undergraduate and MS level Materials Physics and Polymer Processing & Characterization laboratory courses, and also support relevant interdisciplinary masters thesis projects.  The upgraded HR-TEM will also be useful for characterizing materials/devices fabricated in the TxSU microelectronic fabrication laboratory.  It will also be available to support the activities of TxSU investigators working with high school teachers in appropriate summer research projects, and for relevant TxSU Multicultural Engineers and Scientists Student Chapter outreach/workshop activities. The award will have significant impact in improving diversity in the science and engineering workforce.\r\n\r\nThis award from the Major Research Instrumentation program provides allow Texas State University (TxSU) to upgrade a high resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) system recently made available through private donation.
