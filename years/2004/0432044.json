It will emphasize emerging and underdeveloped fields of research that pose interesting and important conceptual issues for philosophers of biology. Finally, the workshop will emphasize the importance of collaborative efforts with biologists and other scholars as a fruitful methodology for philosophers of biology. \r\n\tThe intellectual merit of this proposal relates to the training of graduate students in philosophy of biology.  Meeting together will enable them to establish or strengthen professional relationships in the field. This will be especially beneficial to younger scholars, who may not have had opportunity to forge the kinds of relationships that foster feedback and collaboration on research efforts.\r\nThe broader impacts will include better preparation for independent research expected of professional scholars; a proceedings that will be submitted for publication to Biology &Philosophy; and identification of emerging and underdeveloped fields of research in philosophy of biology will spur research in these fields. \r\n",
