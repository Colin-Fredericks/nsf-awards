The instrument will be applied principally to the study of core samples of marine sediments, providing a unique capability for U.S. researchers.  The instrument provides rapid measurements of chemical elements between aluminum (atomic number 13) and uranium (atomic number 92), co-registered with high resolution images of the surface and subsurface structure of the sample.  Research projects that are expected to take advantage of the project initially include studies of climate and climate change at a number of scales, as well as studies of ocean circulation, terrestrial weathering, sediment source identification, and anthropogenic impacts on coastal environments.  The broader impact of the acquisition includes providing a facility with unique capabilities for US from around the U.S, as well as enabling a capability to study a wide array of projects with compelling societal relevance (climate change, pollution, erosion). WHOI is providing cost-share towards the equipment acquisition of 30% of the project cost from non-federal funds.  This proposal is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences at NSF.\r\n ***\r\n",
