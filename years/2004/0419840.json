 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks new knowledge and insight on fundamental features/mechanisms of ion beam materials processing, analysis and thin film deposition. Greater understanding is particularly sought of stress-states produced by keV ion beams and the relaxation of those stresses through radiation-induced viscous flow and changes in surface morphology. Project goals include answers to questions such as: Does radiation enhanced surface diffusion play a significant role in mass transport during low energy ion bombardment or is radiation-induced viscosity in the bulk of the near surface region a better description? Do low mass ions have the same radiation-induced viscosity as heavy ions despite large differences in the energy density of the cascade? (Computational results suggest that, when scaled properly, radiation-induced viscosity should be almost independent of material, ion energy and ion mass.) Does the proximity of grain boundaries or surfaces strongly modify radiation-induced viscosity? Are a series of spatially and temporally localized melting events equivalent to a very short but uniform melting? The approach encompasses experimental measurements of the evolution of stress created by keV ion bombardment of amorphous, nanocrystalline, and polycrystalline metals, ceramics, and semiconductors. Most films will be deposited in-situ and studies will include ion energy and temperature dependence of stress evolution; time dependence of stress generated by a time-varying ion flux; and stress evolution during de-wetting of films patterned by electron beam lithography. Experiments will be complemented by computational studies of stress generation and relaxation in amorphous, nanocrystalline, and single-crystal materials.\r\n%%%\r\nThe project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science having high potential technological relevance. The research will contribute basic materials science knowledge at a fundamental level to new understanding and capabilities in electronic devices. An important feature of the program is the integration of research and education through the training of students in a fundamentally and technologically significant area. This project will support the education and training of two graduate research assistants. Additionally, undergraduate students will be incorporated into the research activities. New knowledge gained in the research will be integrated into graduate-level courses on surface physics and nanoscience. The PIs will work closely with engineers at APL Engineered Materials, an Urbana, IL company developing products for ion-beam assisted film deposition and a real-time stress sensor suitable for industry.\r\n***\r\n",
