 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program support Professor John Lavigne of the Department of Chemistry at the University of South Carolina, for his work on self-assembling boronate-linked supramolecular networks, which represents a new paradigm in designing molecular aggregates. The proposed systems are based on the covalent yet reversible boronate ester formation utilizing trigonal planar boron compounds and diol compounds in non-aqueous media, forming boronate esters between the building blocks. This approach is in contrast to the majority of molecular recognition literature on boronic acid/ester equilibria which focuses on the assembly of two molecular units. Given the covalent, reversible nature of the boronate ester formation, these assemblies should form in a highly ordered manner. These porous networks will still maintain their structural integrity even if crystalline materials are not obtained. These assemblies are expected to find utility in any of the applications predicted for other self-assembled networks. However, considering the nature of the assembly mechanism, improved stability and therefore enhanced properties would be expected. Compared to their covalently bonded organic counterparts, boronate-linked supramolecules should be assembled with greater ease and higher efficiency; compared to the non-covalently bonded equivalent (such as hydrogen bonding), the boronate linked materials should display enhanced stability given the stronger intermolecular interaction. Furthermore, the directionality and selectivity of this interaction will allow for the introduction of additional functionality thereby creating well-defined, highly functionalized materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith this Award, the Organic and Macromolecular Chemistry Program supports the research activities of Professor John Lavigne at the University of South Carolina that focuses on the synthesis and characterization of the boronate-linked networks. The assembly strategy could be extended to lead to the development of new nano-scale materials for potential applications in the areas of separations, sensing, catalysis, chemical and information storage, as photonic materials, and a wealth of other practical applications. Students will be exposed to a wide range of topics including organic chemistry, physical chemistry, and supramolecular materials. Students will receive training in a highly multidisciplinary environment and will be prepared for research careers in polymers, pharmaceuticals and analytical chemistry.\r\n",
