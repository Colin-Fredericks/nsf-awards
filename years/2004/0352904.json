 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis project will support the International Workshop Biocomplexity VI: Complex\r\nBehavior in Unicellular Organisms, jointly organized by the Biocomplexity\r\nInstitute at Indiana University and the Interdisciplinary Center for the Study of\r\nBiocomplexity at the University of Notre Dame. The collective behavior of\r\nbacteria is as a problem in basic science and is significant in bioengineering, agriculture, medicine, naval architecture and geosciences.... Biofouling is a major problem in cases ranging from surgical implants to submarines, and biofilms are a major cause of antibiotic-resistant infections. The regulatory mechanisms for collective behaviors in bacteria differ from those in more advanced organisms and present an opportunity to compare different design solutions to similar biological problems related to embryonic development. This workshop will develop a more comprehensive view of our current understanding of these issues and include a panel to discuss and report on new directions and collaborations. It will bring together researchers in many disciplines who would not normally attend the same conference (including experimental and theoretical biology, biophysics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science). Approaches will range from single molecule interactions and genetics to systems biology and ecology. About fifty speakers will attend from the USA, Canada, Europe, Israel and Japan, with a total participation of about 100, including many non-specialists. The workshop will include tutorials for graduate students and junior scientists, especially those not currently in the field, but interested in learning about open problems, methodologies and opportunities. As part of the workshop's outreach effort, Dr. Eshel Ben-Jacob will present a public lecture for nonscientists and interested members of the community-at-large.\r\n",
