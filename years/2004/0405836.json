Meeks, University of Massachusetts (Amherst)\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nProposed Research Project Abstract\r\n\r\nIn this proposal the researcher will study the geometry, asymptotic\r\nbehavior, conformal structure and topology of properly embedded\r\nminimal surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean space.  One of the main\r\ngoals of the proposal is to classify all of the properly embedded minimal \r\nsurfaces which can be parametrized by domains in the Euclidean plane and\r\nto describe the asymptotic geometry of all finite genus examples.\r\nRelated theoretical techniques concerning compactness, regularity and\r\nconvergence of minimal surfaces of locally bounded genus will be\r\ninvestigated as well.  One hoped for application of this research is\r\nto classify all smooth finite group actions on the three-dimensional\r\nsphere.  As an outgrowth of his recent joint manuscript with Charles\r\nFrohman on the topological classification for minimal surfaces, the\r\nresearcher proposes to prove that Bryant surfaces in hyperbolic \r\nthree-space are unknotted.\r\n\r\nClassical minimal surface theory has its roots in 18-th and 19-th\r\ncentury mathematics. Minimal surfaces are the first\r\nimportant examples of what is called the calculus of variations, first\r\ndescribed by Euler around 1735.  Physically minimal surfaces can be\r\nmodeled locally as soap films on wires or by surfaces of least-area \r\nrelative to their local boundaries.  Minimal surfaces play an important\r\nrole as a tool in the study of three-dimensional topology and\r\nRiemannian geometry. The subject of minimal surfaces has a broad impact in mathematics and\r\nphysical sciences.  Minimal surfaces are stationary fluid interfaces,so\r\ntheir shapes arise in many physical problems.  The work in this\r\nproposal would classify the possible physical shapes which could occur\r\nas infinite interfaces.  Many of the known examples of minimal surfaces\r\nare observed physically, so it is of interest to have a rigorous\r\ntheorem which predicts the shapes which can occur.\r\nThe research proposed here strongly impacts the area of classical\r\ndifferential geometry of surfaces in three-dimensional Euclidean\r\nspace.  As is well known to geometers, minimal surface theory has been\r\nand continues to be one of the principal tools for proving theorems in\r\ngeneral relativity and three-dimensional topology.  One well-known\r\nsuch application is Schoen and Yau's proof of the Positive Mass\r\nConjecture.  Recent work of Gabai on the Generalized Smale Conjecture\r\nshows the continued importance of minimal surfaces in\r\nthree-dimensional topology. Most of the research proposed here is related to and\r\nmotivated by the hope that it will lead to a positive solution of the\r\nPitts-Rubenstein Conjecture and to the classification of\r\nthree-manifolds with finite fundamental group.  This hoped for\r\ntopological application to one of the outstanding classification\r\nproblems in mathematics has its roots in previous joint research by\r\nthe researcher, Peter Scott, Charles Frohman and S. T. Yau.  In part\r\nbecause of the important connections with other areas of mathematics\r\nand the ease in which it is possible to make computer graphics\r\npictures of beautiful classical examples, minimal surfaces continue to\r\nbe one of the principal topics for popular science articles and public\r\nscience exhibits.  Thus, indirectly, the exciting research problems\r\noutlined in this proposal help bring many young scientists and\r\nmathematicians to the frontiers of research. \r\n\r\n",
