Paulino,\r\nBurton and Erma Lewis Faculty Scholar\r\nDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering,\r\nUniversity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Newmark Laboratory,\r\n205 North Mathews Avenue, Newmark Laboratory, Urbana, IL, 61801, USA\r\ne-mail: paulino@uiuc.edu, url: http://cee.uiuc.edu/paulino\r\n\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThe Boundary Element Method (BEM) has in recent years become an established method in several important areas of engineering, especially in mechanics and advanced materials modeling and simulation. The next Conference of the International Association for Boundary Element Methods (IABEM'2004) will be held at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, from May 24-26, 2004. The Conference promotes international cooperation between scientists and engineers from different disciplines. In this Conference, a good number of graduate students is supposed to participate, and the broadest outreach to the students will be the Student Paper Competition! This program is open to any full time student who is the lead author, with primary responsibility, of a paper at the conference. Their work will be judged by a committee of judges who will provide their assessment to the \"Technical Program Committee\" that originally accepted the paper submission. Two major events will comprise the Student Paper Competition: the Student Paper Session and the Awards Ceremony. In the \"Student Paper Session,\" each participant will give an oral presentation in the presence of students, advisors, professors, judges, and other interested Conference registrants. During the \"Awards Ceremony,\" the First, Second, and third Prizes will be announced, which may be shared.  The Student paper competition will be a major event in the IABEM Conference. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
