 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the National Science Foundation's ADVANCE program is to increase the participation of women in the scientific and engineering workforce through the increased representation and advancement of women in academic science and engineering careers. To meet this goal, the ADVANCE program has awarded 19 Institutional Transformation grants and 27 Leadership grants to date. Many of these grant recipients have female engineering faculty as a primary or significant area of focus. Communication among ADVANCE awardees and dissemination to the broader engineering community are critical to increasing the impact of the program. To facilitate sharing the findings among the grantees and to increase the broader impacts of the program with the engineering community, a one-day meeting is planned for the Fall, 2004 in Arlington, Virginia. Participants will included the engineering deans and the principal investigators of the institutions having ADVANCE Institutional Transformation and ADVANCE Leadership awards, and engineering deans from other universities. \r\n",
