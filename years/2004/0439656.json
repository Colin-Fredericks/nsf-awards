 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a workshop to bring together geoscientists working with sedimentary cores, samples, and collections acquired as part of academic research projects. The workshop's primary goal is to determine the long-term, marine-core repository needs of US Antarctic Program investigators for the next twenty to forty years. The location of the workshop in Tallahassee will allow the experts to visit the Antarctic Marine Geology Research Facility to assess its operations and current state of utilization. Through the workshop, participants will identify the needs of this research community; including the facilities, equipment, and data/metadata needed. By establishing a list of priority needs and major issues, an effective plan for meeting those needs will be formulated and recommended to the National Science Foundation. \r\nBroader Impact: The USAP marine-core repository provides a primary resource for research on the Antarctic ice sheets, which play an important role in global climate and sea level change. \r\n",
