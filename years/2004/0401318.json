He will\r\nstudy perturbed Eisenstein series in Teichmueller space and character\r\nvarieties in relation to the disappearance of cusp forms (higher order\r\nPhillips-Sarnak conditions), and apply  analytic number  theory techniques \r\nin the spectral theory of Hilbert modular varieties (subconvex estimates\r\nof the L-series of a Maass cusp form and equidistribution of Eisenstein\r\nseries) and Heisenberg manifolds (distribution of the error term in Weyl's\r\nlaw for the  eigenvalues of the Laplace operator).\r\n\r\nThis research falls into the general mathematical field of Number Theory.   \r\nNumber theory has its historical roots in the study of the whole numbers, \r\naddressing such questions as those dealing with the divisibility of one  \r\nwhole number by another. It is among the oldest branches of mathematics \r\nand   was pursued for many centuries for purely aesthetic reasons. \r\nHowever, within   the last half century it has become an indispensable tool in \r\ndiverse   applications in areas such as data transmission and processing, and   \r\ncommunication systems. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
