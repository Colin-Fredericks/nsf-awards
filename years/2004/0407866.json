 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to develope theoretical models of crystalline solids\r\nthat are based on the positions of the  atoms that make up the crystal.\r\n As a first step, the PI proposes to study (large) elastic deformation \r\nof perfect crystals. This will help us to understand the critical strain that\r\nthe material can sustain before defects form. The PI then proposes to\r\nstudy the formation, structure, energetics and dynamics of defects in crystals.\r\nUnderstanding defects in crystals is crucial since defects control the \r\nresponse and failure of the material, as in, e.g. nano-devices\r\nand semi-conductor thin films.  By understanding the interplay between \r\nloading and failure mechanisms as well as their microscopic origin, the PI  \r\nhopes to give guidelines fordesigning materials that avoid certain modes of failure.\r\nTo obtain simplified models that can be readily linked with traditional \r\ntheories of continuum mechanics, the PI also proposes to develop \r\ncontinuum models  in the form of nonlinear elasticity theory \r\nthat are derived directly from the atomistic models. Such a theory gives \r\na much simplified description for the material properties and are \r\ntherefore easier to use.\r\n                                                                                       \r\nAs applications, the PI proposes to study the mechanical properties of\r\ncarbon nano-tubes. Nano-tubes are very good examples for this project\r\nsince they can sustain very large elastic deformation before failure. In fact \r\nthey are the strongest fiber known to us. The PI proposes to study large \r\n(therefore nonlinear) deformations of nano-tubes, their modes of failure, \r\nas well as properties of nano-tube-reinforced materials.\r\n",
