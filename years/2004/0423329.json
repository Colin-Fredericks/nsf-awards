 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research project is to investigate novel embedded solid lubricant cutting tool coatings for applications in machining and manufacturing processes.  The research concept is to use lithographic patterning methods to create two-component coatings.  One component of the coating will be a hard compound that is highly wear resistant, and the second component, embedded in the hard compound, will be a solid lubricant material.  This approach will alleviate a common problem encountered in the use of solid lubricant coatings, namely short wear life.  This research project will investigate methods for fabricating and patterning these coatings, the mechanical and thermal stability of the coatings, and the operative tribological mechanisms that determine their frictional behavior.  In addition to laboratory analysis and tribological testing of the coatings, a key component of the research will be to apply the coatings to cutting tools and perform instrumented metal cutting tests.\r\n\r\nThe ability to fabricate engineered metallic components using cutting and forming processes is integral to a wide range of manufacturing processes.  The application of coatings to cutting tools and metal forming dies can enhance tool life and reduce the energy expended in overcoming frictional forces.  The use of liquid lubricants also reduces friction, however, environmental and health issues, as well as economic concern over the cost of their treatment and disposal has made the use of solid lubricants more attractive.  This research program will promote the development of high wear-resistance coatings incorporating solid lubricants.  The use of these coatings could lead to a reduction in environmental waste, as well as reducing the costs of waste fluid treatment and disposal. The program also aims to improve technical awareness about engineered coatings by developing portable educational modules that can be used at the high-school level.",
