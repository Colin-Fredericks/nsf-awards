 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project is concerned with the development,\r\nanalysis and applications of numerical simulation tools\r\nto a number of problems in computational sciences,\r\nin particular, in computational physics and computational\r\nmaterial sciences.  It is a continuation of PI's past research \r\nwork in this area that has contributed to the modeling, analysis, \r\nand computation of various problems in superconductivity,\r\nBose-Einstein condensation, and phase transitions in binary and \r\nmulticomponent alloys. \r\n\r\nIn the proposed work,  while building upon the past progress,\r\nthe PI will take on new initiatives in the study of some interesting \r\nphysical problems at various time and spatial scales\r\nand in the design of new algorithms and efficient\r\nsolvers which can then be used to understand experimental phenomena\r\nand the underlying physical and material properties.\r\nThe proposed works are to be carried out in the following  aspects:  \r\nto develop or refine mathematical models for the underlying physical \r\nproblems, so to enlarge the range of validity of  such  models; to \r\nanalyze these models in order to gain further understanding of their \r\nproperties and of their solutions;  to develop, analyze, and\r\nimplement algorithms, in particular, parallel and adaptive algorithms,\r\nfor the numerical simulation of these models; and to use our algorithms \r\nand codes, together with physicists and material scientists, \r\nto study some interesting phenomena in physics and material sciences,\r\nincluding the further studies on the quantized vortices in \r\nsuperconductors and Bose-Einstein condensates, on the effects of\r\nfluctuation and on the validity and the extension of mezoscopic \r\nphenomenological models.  While we will focus on developing innovative \r\nmathematical theory and computational algorithms, comparisons with the  \r\nphysical experiments will also be made whenever possible.\r\n",
