 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is concerned with the development of a radically new class of molten-salt produced anodized coatings for the advanced corrosion protection of magnesium alloys. More specifically, this proposed work will develop the electrochemical basis and technical effectiveness of this new class of recently discovered inorganic coatings. These new coatings are producible via low temperature non-aqueous molten-salt electrolytes and will contribute toward increasing magnesium alloy usage as part of the national effort (United Sates Automotive Materials Partnership) to reduce vehicle weight and increase vehicle mileage. \r\n\r\nCorrosion of magnesium is an important problem in its industrial use especially in the transportation industry.  The discovery of a new class of inorganic anti-corrosion coatings presents an opportunity for significant improvement in corrosion protection for magnesium. The potential applications of this research include coatings for aeronautical as well as vehicular magnesium engineering components and devices.  Additionally the electrolytes used to prepare this new class of coatings are environmentally benign and do not have the waste disposal problems associated with currently used coatings.   \r\n \r\n",
