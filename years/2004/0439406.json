 "awd_abstract_narration": "PROJECT SUMMARY \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit:  \r\nMolar-tooth (MT) is an enigmatic carbonate fabric marked by variously shaped voids \r\nfilled with a uniform, equant microspar. To date, research has focused largely on deciphering \r\nmechanisms of void formation and delineating MT distribution in time and space. MT \r\npreservation, however, is intimately linked to precipitation of MT microspar, about which we \r\nknow little. MT microspar consists of uniform, equant, non-interlocking crystals that under \r\ncathodoluminescence (CL) show dully-luminescent, subspherical cores (5-7 m diameter) and \r\nluminescent overgrowths. Conditions favoring precipitation were common in the \r\nMesoproterozoic and early Neoproterozoic (1600-750 Ma), where MT microspar comprises \r\n>90% of individual beds and 5-25% of preserved carbonate (volumetrically equivalent to \r\nPaleozoic skeletal grains). The objective of this project is to investigate an unusual, yet \r\nvolumetrically significant, morphology of carbonate, termed molar-tooth (MT) microspar, whose \r\nwidespread occurrence in the Mesoproterozoic and early Neoproterozoic suggests linkages \r\nbetween carbonate precipitation and the broad-scale geochemical evolution of marine \r\nenvironments. This proposal will address three questions: (1) What are the nucleation and growth \r\nmechanisms of this unusual carbonate microspar? (2) Was vaterite the original mineralogy of this \r\nmicrospar, as has been previously proposed? and (3) What can this unusual carbonate \r\nmorphology tell us about the composition of Proterozoic marine systems?  \r\nUnfortunately, small crystal sizes inhibit use of many traditional techniques in further \r\nexamining microspar origins. I propose a multidisciplinary approach wherein high-resolution CL \r\nand SEM imaging will be used to define morphologic endmembers, reconstruct crystal size \r\ndistributions, and interpret nucleation and growth mechanisms; laser-Raman spectroscopy will be \r\nused to document lattice structure to help constrain mineralogical change; and combined high-\r\nresolution SIMS trace element imaging, Raman spectroscopy, and crystal growth experiments \r\nwill be used to constrain initial fluid compositions and precipitation conditions. Ultimately, \r\ndeciphering the genesis of MT microspar will help identify chemical environments of formation \r\nand will aid in understanding the sedimentary impact of long-term chemical changes in the \r\nEarth.s biosphere. \r\n \r\nBroader Impacts:   \r\nThis project aims to advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, \r\ntraining, and learning by expanding the breadth of carbonate-based research at the University of \r\nTennessee, adding research opportunities for undergraduate students, involving students directly \r\nin the process of scientific inquiry, encouraging scientific activity in which undergraduates will \r\nassist and be mentored by graduate students and faculty, and encouraging student participation in \r\nregional and national meetings. Currently, I have 3 students lined up for this project [1 M.S. \r\n(male) and 2 B.S. (female); 2 of them non-traditional students returning to school after starting \r\nfamilies]. This project will also enhance the research and education infrastructure at the UT by \r\nsupporting initiatives to expand use of multi-user facilities and establish interdisciplinary \r\ncollaboration within the University (Geology-Chemistry) and with Oak Ridge National Labs. \r\nFinally, the project aims to broaden participation of under-represented groups through continued \r\nresearch- and equipment-based collaboration with the State University of West Georgia, a non-\r\nPh.D. granting institution. Such collaboration raises student awareness of opportunities in the \r\nEarth Sciences and strengthens UT.s ability to attract new graduate students.",
