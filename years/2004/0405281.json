The emphasis of the\r\nproject is on the determination of analytical and topological\r\ninvariants of the manifolds, such as the signature, A-roof-genus\r\nand elliptic genera. Following the evidence from our previous\r\nresearch, we propose to apply the aforementioned theory to\r\nconcrete Geometric Analysis/Differential Geometry\r\nproblems. Furthermore, this study has applications to Algebraic\r\nGeometry (via twistor transform) and to Theoretical Physics,\r\nsince the manifolds under consideration are of interest in sigma\r\nmodels and in String Theory.\r\n\r\nMy research interests are concerned with the study of certain\r\nspaces of large dimension, called quaternion-Kaehler\r\nmanifolds. In the quest for understanding the universe,\r\nphysicists have developed many and very sophisticated models,\r\nsuch as Relativity Theory and more recently String Theory, that\r\nhelp explain and predict phenomena observed in the Universe.  One\r\nof the leading physicists of our times, E. Witten, discovered\r\nthat quaternion-Kaehler manifolds appear in the formulation of\r\ncertain Quantum Field Theories.  My research focuses on finding\r\nthe possible shapes and properties of quaternion- Kaehler\r\nmanifolds.\r\n",
