 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project team is developing a package of distance learning courses for technicians in photonics.  Remote-controlled laboratory exercises, multimedia interactive laboratory manuals and courseware, are being developed and used to train technicians at the PI's institution and at other institutions in the region. These materials, in conjunction with materials developed on a previous project, constitute a complete package of photonics courses with laboratories for remote students.  In order to encourage the sharing of facilities nationwide, the group is developing a database of remote-controlled laboratories, which is being hosted on their website.  They plan to link this site to those of national organizations, such as SPIE.  Evaluation plans include soliciting feedback from students on the textbooks and laboratory materials, monitoring student performance, and obtaining feedback from the employers whose employees are taking the courses. National workshops are being used to disseminate the materials and to help teams at other locations undertake the development of similar programs.",
