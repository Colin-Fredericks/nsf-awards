 "awd_abstract_narration": "The  project  aims  to  extend  the  ability  of  theory  to  predict  quantitative  rates  for  the destruction  of  polyatomic molecules  by  electron  collision,  through  the  process  called  dissociative  recombination.  The  goal  of  this  research  is  to  carry  out  detailed  quantum  mechanical  calculations  of  the  dissociative recombination process that occurs when an electron collides with a polyatomic molecular ion.  In almost all studies of this process to date, theoretical descriptions have been forced to resort to models of restricted dimensionality, out of computational necessity. Very recent studies have demonstrated, that the full 3D vibrational motion of a triatomic target molecule can be crucially important in some cases.  Specifically, in the scattering of an electron from an H3+ ion, the vibrational angular momentum couples to an incident electron through the Jahn-Teller interaction, resulting in recombination rates orders of magnitude higher than a limited dimensionality model predicts.  \r\n\r\nThe present proposal plans to capitalize on a recent theoretical breakthrough, to describe the scattering of a low energy electron from polyatomic molecules, including all degrees of freedom quantum mechanically through a divide-and-conquer computational strategy. If this project is successful, the ability to theoretically describe, and to qualitatively understand, the mechanisms of interacting electron-polyatomic systems will be advanced.   \r\n\r\nNote that the two main arms of this work are: (i) a concerted study of the ab initio quantum chemistry issues, at  the  level  of  electronic  structure  theory  in  the  electron  continuum,  both with  and without  electronic  resonances present;  and (ii) a detailed investigation of the coupled electron and nuclear motions, using as tools (depending on the  system)  either  standard  resonance  theory  when  it  is  adequate,  or  rovibrational  frame  transformation  and multichannel quantum defect techniques when the most comprehensive treatment is desired.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by the Divisions of Physics and Chemistry under the ITR Program.",
