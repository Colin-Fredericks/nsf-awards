The laboratory is utilizing eight experiments adapted from a highly successful program at the University of Minnesota in addition to developing four new laboratory experiments that utilize state-of-the-art technology.  The project also includes a short course program for practicing engineers and a collaboration with a NASA lab that will also support this effort and provide two senior NASA research engineers to act as advisors. The specific objectives of this project are: 1) to have 40 electrical engineering undergraduate students per year successfully complete three courses in power electronics and electrical machines, 2) to increase undergraduate enrollment in an advanced power electronics course by 50%, and 3) to update the skills of 10 practicing engineers from regional companies specializing in power electronics and electric machine technology per year. The evaluation effort includes monitoring course enrollment records and short course attendance, analyzing of student performance and evaluations, and conducting employer surveys. Dissemination plans include conference and journal papers and participation in on-going national faculty workshops on teaching power electronics and drives.\r\n",
