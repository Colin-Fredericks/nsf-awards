 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP), Hampton University will implement a comprehensive program that will:  1) enhance curricula in modeling and computational science; 2) provide a summer program for entering freshmen; 3) provide research opportunities for undergraduate students; 4) provide professional development for faculty in the areas of mentoring, technology, and modeling; 5) support student scholars.   Hampton University will continue to support the Integrated Learning Environment that was established during their first HBCU-UP project.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The project will ensure that undergraduate students have the tools to be academically and professionally competitive.  As highlighted in a 1999 National Academy of Science report, undergraduate students must possess (1) contemporary skills that allow them to use computer applications, (2) foundational concepts that enable them to demonstrate a basic understanding of the principles and concepts of computing, and (3) demonstrate intellectual skills including the ability to apply information technology to particular situations, and to use this technology to solve new problems.  The implementation of the Student Research Initiative with Modeling and Computational Science will address these academic challenges.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact: The HBCU-UP project targets biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics, and psychology, where women and minorities are underrepresented.  By providing students with training and tools in modeling and computational science, and providing research opportunities that will supplement their selected program of study, students will be better equipped to succeed in graduate school and the workforce.  The HBCU-UP project will enhance undergraduate research in the sciences and engineering and increase the number of women and African-Americans who pursue advanced degrees and careers in STEM fields.  The Student Research Initiative with Modeling and Computational Science project can serve as a model for other institutions. \r\n\r\n",
