The first\r\ntopic of the proposed research falls into this category, with the\r\nadditional complexity of dealing with a system made of living\r\norganisms. The PI and a collaborator have recently developed a\r\nhydrodynamic model describing the dynamics and growth of bacterial\r\ncolonies at a macroscopic level. The PI will now investigate the\r\nmicroscopic dynamics of interacting bacteria. Numerical\r\nsimulations of \"live\" interacting particles will be developed, on\r\nwhich coarse-graining will be applied to obtain a description at\r\nthe macroscopic level. The search will be for a set of collision\r\nrules that can reproduce and explain the collective behaviors that\r\nhave recently been observed in dense colonies of bacteria. This\r\nstudy will also lay the ground for the future development of\r\nkinetic models of collections of living organisms. The second\r\ntopic of the proposed research concerns the stability of coherent\r\nstructures. The kink-anti-kink profile of a bacterial colony, the\r\nlocal deformations of an elastic filament, or the ultra-short\r\npulses propagating in an optical fiber, are all examples of\r\ncoherent structures. Such objects are often described as special\r\nsolutions of one or more model partial differential equations, and\r\nmodern analytical techniques have been developed to address the\r\nquestion of their stability. The PI will combine such techniques\r\nwith numerical calculations and asymptotic expansions, in order to\r\nobtain stability and instability results for coherent structures\r\nobserved in nonlinear optics and in reaction-diffusion equations\r\nwith nonlinear diffusion. The tools and methods that will be\r\ndeveloped in such a study are general enough to be applied to\r\nother evolutionary partial differential equations.\r\n\r\nMathematical modeling is nowadays playing an important and growing\r\nrole in the life and physical sciences. In particular, models that\r\nare based on our vision of how various building blocks of a\r\ncomplex system interact with one another, and which translate this\r\nvision into mathematical terms, can be used to test our theories\r\nand make sure our understanding is built on solid ground. The main\r\nchallenge we face with such an approach is that our intuition\r\noften feels more at ease at the microscopic - or the building\r\nblock - level, even though we live in a macroscopic world. All of\r\nthe difficulty lies in bridging the gap between these two worlds.\r\nThe first part of this work deals with such a problem: the goal is\r\nto understand how microscopic interactions between bacteria may\r\nlead to collective, macroscopic behaviors, as observed in some\r\nexperiments. Such phenomena will be modeled in the case of\r\nlaboratory grown colonies of bacteria, but similar principles\r\ncould be applied to the formation and dynamics of biofilms, which\r\nhave many engineering and medical applications. The second part of\r\nthe work concerns general methods for the analysis of mathematical\r\nmodels which involve nonlinear partial differential equations. In\r\nparticular, the stability of solutions of some models relevant to\r\nnonlinear optics and population dynamics will be investigated.\r\n",
