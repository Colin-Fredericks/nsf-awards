The goal of the project is to introduce Earth as a dynamic, complex, global system and to convey basic concepts of systems and the elements of scale, change and interconnection on our planet.  \"Pulse of the Planet\" reaches over one million listeners daily on over 300 public and commercial stations worldwide.  The 300 new programs produced in English will be adapted and co-produced in Spanish by ETCOM for broadcast with its 106 radio affiliates.  Each radio segment will be supported and extended on the National Geographic Online website with news commissioned to accompany the radio programs.  The NGO feature will also include an audio program archive, links to NationalGeographic.com guides, related stories, photo galleries, maps and links for additional listener research.  Learning Experience Design Research will conduct formative and summative evaluation services in English and Spanish.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
