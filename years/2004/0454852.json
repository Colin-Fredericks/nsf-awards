As the first stage towards developing a\r\nframework for bridging STEM training and recruitment efforts undertaken by MIE\r\ninstitutions at the undergraduate level with those implemented at the middle school and\r\nsecondary education levels, TMG seeks funding to convene representatives from the\r\nsix MIE institutions, MIE graduates who are now graduate students or serving as\r\nprofessionals in STEM fields, high school counselors, representatives from\r\ncommunity colleges, recognized researchers and practitioners in K-14 or High\r\nSchool-College partnerships, and representatives from exemplary pre-college STEM\r\nprograms serving African-American, Latino, and Native American students. The\r\nworkshop convening will permit these researchers and practitioners to plan an\r\nintegrated, research-based design and framework for implementing appropriate\r\nprogrammatic strategies that eventually will then be piloted at MIEs and 1 or more\r\nnon-MIE university sites. During the pilot phase, TMG will provide each site with support\r\nfor addressing programmatic challenges and enhancing success.",
