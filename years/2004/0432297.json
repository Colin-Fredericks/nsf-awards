 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proliferation of Internet technologies, services and devices, have made the current networked system designs, and management tools, incapable of designing reliable, secure network systems and services.  In fact, we have reached a level of complexity, heterogeneity, and dynamism that our information infrastructure is becoming unmanageable and insecure.  Furthermore, current design techniques and software tools that control and manage the information infrastructure are incapable of handling its complexity, heterogeneity, uncertainty, and security requirements.  Autonomic computing research will enable the design of the next of the next generation of networked systems and services that are capable of managing and controlling themselves, and can anticipate their workloads and automatically adjust the configurations of their resources to meet the new loads.\r\n\r\nThe ICAC workshop will be focused on the research issues and challenges facing the development of autonomic computing systems.  The goal of the CLADE workshop is to encourage innovation by addressing the complex issues that arise in large-scale applications of distributed computation and to promote the development of innovative applications that effectively use distributed resources and adapt to a wide range of heterogeneity and dynamics in space and time.  This includes development, deployment, management and evaluations of large scale applications in science, engineering, medicine, business, economics, education, and other disciplines, on Grids and other distributed heterogeneous and dynamic computing environments.\r\n",
