 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum computation holds tremendous potential as the next generation technology. Similar to the binary bits in classical computation, information can be stored in two-state quantum bits or qubits, which can entangle with each other to provide possibilities of quantum parallelism and quantum computation. The qubit manifests quantum superposition, which enables it to remain in multiple states at the same time, allowing an infinite set of possibilities for storing information. Furthermore, quantum parallelism makes it possible to process information at an astoundingly high speed with more efficient \"quantum\" algorithms. However, the main obstacle towards the practical realization of quantum bit systems is the loss of coherence or decoherence. Due to its coupling to the environmental noise, the quantum bit loses is coherence or its ability to form quantum superposition states, which results in the loss of quantum information. Therefore, it is essential to develop techniques for controlling coherence of to minimize the effect of environmental coupling.  \r\n\r\nThis project involves a comprehensive effort for developing control techniques to engineer the coupling between the quantum system and the environment, and increase the coherence time to maintain quantum superposition states for a longer period of time. The specific goal of this project is to devise methods for controlling quantum coherence in the electron wave function in nanoelectronic devices.  The experiments will involve ultra-fast picosecond pulses and pulse trains for designing suitable environment for the electron to control, and perhaps, to reverse the effect of decoherence. The successful realization of these experiments will allow multiple quantum gate operations within the enhanced coherence time, which is necessary for quantum computation.  As an enabling technology, coherence control in solid-state-based quantum systems will be a revolutionary advance towards the ultimate goal of realizing practical quantum computers. This project will have significant impact on the students, who will benefit from their training in the cutting-edge technologies of nanoscience and their exposure to advanced concepts in quantum information science. Both the training and the research will enable these young researchers to be part of the nation's next-generation workforce in nanotechnology. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
