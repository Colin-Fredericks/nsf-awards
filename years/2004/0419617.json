The ages of recent geological, climatological, and archeological events older than the range of radiocarbon dating (>30,000 years) are often poorly known.  This award establishes a Shared Facility aimed at increasing accessibility and reliability of a geochronological tool used to understand the timing, frequency, and rates of Earth surface processes.  The amino acid geochronology laboratory was initiated in 1996 with an EAR/IF award.  An analytical procedure was developed with the new instrumentation that has improved detection capabilities by at least an order of magnitude, presenting new opportunities to apply amino acid geochronology and paleothermometry to microfossils, including ostracodes and foraminifera.  The mission of the Shared Facility for amino acid geochronology is to: (1) refine an important geochronological tool, (2) apply it to a variety of scientific problems, (3) train new users, and (4) coordinate activities among laboratories practicing amino acid geochronology.  The shared facility will support more than a dozen NSF-funded and other researchers by performing analyses and providing interpretive information.  Approximately 1500 analyses per year will be offered at a nominal fee ($5 per sample, about one-tenth the standard rate).  A primary goal is to cross-check the results of amino acid geochronology with results of other geochronological methods.  The facility will also work with researchers to design and conduct a variety of experiments aimed at improving the accuracy and applicability of the technique.  The facility will train new users, and it will offer services to add cohesion and uniformity to amino acid geochronology, including: distributing inter-laboratory standards, sharing HPLC columns, compiling extended AAR data sets, and developing a website.  The operation of the facility will be guided by two designated advisors, who will also assess the impact of the facility at the conclusion of the award period.  The majority of the award budget will be devoted to one half of the laboratory technician's (Jordon Bright) salary.  Bright has worked in the lab for over eight years and has gained considerably expertise.  His ongoing involvement will enable the laboratory to develop into a Shared Facility, which will make amino acid analyses and other services accessible to a broader community of practitioners and users.\r\n***\r\n\r\n",
