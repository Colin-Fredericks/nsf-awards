 "awd_abstract_narration": "Doron Zeilberger proposes to continue to develop\r\nmethodologies for harnessing the great potential of\r\nComputer Algebra to do research in Combinatorics and\r\nrelated areas, and design experiments for (rigorous)\r\ncomputer-assisted and computer-generated research.\r\nIn particular he hopes to develop a new algorithmic theory\r\nto be named `Symbolic Moment Calculus', that would produce\r\nalgorithms for computing,  symbolically and automatically, \r\n(statistical) moments of interesting combinatorial quantities.\r\nHe also plans to develop a general theory of recurrence equations\r\nthat would include both the `Dynamic Programming' recurrences\r\nfeaturing the maximum, ubiquitous in Computational Biology,\r\nand the mex operation, that occurs in the theory of\r\nCombinatorial Games.\r\nHe also proposes to continue his\r\nefforts in `Artificial Combinatorics', and develop algorithms\r\nfor the discovery and  rigorous proof of \r\nenumeration schemes for counting permutation classes, and for \r\nautomatically deducing generating functions. Another\r\nline of research concerns automatic determinant evaluations\r\nthat has potential applications in applied mathematics and\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThis research should be symbiotic, as it is\r\nexpected that both the concrete results and \r\nthe underlying methodologies, would help computer algebra developers\r\nto improve and enhance their systems. It is also hoped that\r\nthis research will contribute to the budding field of Experimental\r\nMathematics, in that it will help develop a research methodology for\r\nconducting computer experiments that output  rigorous \r\n(and interesting!) mathematical theorems\r\n(and proofs), rather than just verifying and formulating conjectures.\r\n\r\nThis research is in the field of Combinatorics, whose usefulness\r\nto science and technology is well-known. In particular, computer\r\nscience is largely based on combinatorics, as is electronic\r\ncommunication and the World Wide Web.\r\n",
