 "awd_abstract_narration": "Engineering-Engineering Technology (58)  Valencia Community College is developing coursework for a new Robotics and Simulation specialization within its Electronics Engineering Technology Associate Degree program.  The new specialization is incorporating best practices in curriculum and instruction from other institutional models while addressing local industry needs.  Site visits are providing information about textbooks and laboratory manuals to be used in the specialization courses, course syllabi, equipment and equipment maintenance, facility modifications to house equipment, lab safety practices, assessment practices, expected competencies, enrollment, faculty training resources, and course scheduling.  An independent evaluator and representatives from the program's business advisory committee are providing continuous feedback to achieve maximum effectiveness of the project. \r\n\r\nThe PI and Co-PIs are integrating research on measuring learning outcomes and diversity of learning styles with examples of best curriculum practices to enhance learning among Valencia's underrepresented significantly-minority and economically disadvantaged student population.  Project activities include (1) identification of specific assessment practices that are designed to help students develop the skills, dispositions, and knowledge needed to be actively engaged in their academic work; (2) set and maintain realistically high expectations and goals; (3) seek and find connections to and real-world applications of what they're learning; (4) understand and value the criteria, standards, and methods by which they are assessed and evaluated; and (5) work regularly and productively with academic staff and students to help students attain a high quality academic performance.\r\n",
