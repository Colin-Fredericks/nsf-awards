Details and history of the series can be found at http://AIMsciences.org.  The goal of this conference is to gather mathematicians and scientists with different training background and research approaches, to report on their recent achievements, exchange new ideas and look for future directions in an atmosphere that prompts considerable intellectual interaction and inspiration.  The conference program will consist of nine invited plenary talks and about 200 invited talks in 15 special sessions.  Topics of special sessions represent currently active research areas within the focus of dynamical systems and differential equations.  Young researchers will have the opportunity to present their talks at a special session or contributed session.  The conference will also feature a session devoted to discussions about future directions and perspectives in the fields of dynamical systems and differential equations.  Results of the discussion will be reported and published.",
