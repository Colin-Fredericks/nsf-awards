 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I research project will develop a device for the in-vivo activation of nanoparticles for the minimally-invasive treatment of solid tumors and for the prophylactic treatment of potential routes of metastatic spread with minimal damage to surrounding tissues. Nanoshells are a new class of nanoparticles that can be designed to absorb light in the near-infrared, wavelengths where tissue is minimally absorptive.  Prior nanoshell research has demonstrated its promise for a significant new class of cancer therapies.  However, the optical and thermal properties of this new class of materials, the interaction of these properties with the optical properties of human tissue, and, in particular, this interaction at near-infrared wavelengths, are not well understood.  This Phase I research will first determine the properties of this new class of materials in vivo and then optimize laser power, laser pulse characteristics  (repetition rate, duration and duty cycle), and fiber optic delivery modes.\r\n\r\nThe commercial application of this project will be in the area of cancer therapy. The nanoshell-based therapy is expected to be useful for a broad range of cancer types, with significant advantages relative to other treatments.",
