 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a wireless and batteryless RFID heart monitoring system based on phonocardiograph MEMS technology. The system uses a disposable MEMS sensor in the form of adhesive tags that receive power remotely through a remote radio frequency\r\nsource.  In this proposed system, heart sound is obtained through wireless communication with a personal computer (PC) node.  With the PC, heart sound is presented graphically, recorded or analyzed for further use. The PC node can be part of a remote patient monitoring (RPM) system. The wireless phonocardiograph offers some other advantages over other cardiograph systems: no wire connections and no electrical contact point between the human body and the sensor as compared with a multi-wire ECG, multi-channel monitoring of the cardiovascular system.\r\n\r\nThe commercialized product with disposable tag-based sensors can replace the jungle of wiring and/or battery powered heart monitoring devices currently in use by the millions worldwide. This system with low cost and a highly versatile system platform will be qualified first with non-clinical setting and later for extensive use within the hospital itself.",
