Simultaneous operations of microbeam arrays can lead to significantly increased\r\nthroughput in applications including chemical and force sensors, imaging, and data storage. These\r\neffects can lead to dynamically interesting phenomena, including localization and parametric\r\ninstability. By understanding these effects, design and operation can be proposed which allow the\r\ncantilevers to synchronize, leading to sensor enhancement. This proposed work will involve\r\nmodeling, analysis, and experimentation. In this work the nonlinear response of microbeams near\r\nresonance will be investigated in detail and features will be mapped out that are important for\r\nperformance. The analytical investigations will focus on perturbation, symmetry, and phase\r\nreduction techniques applied to weakly nonlinear models for microbeams, which will allow one to\r\npredict the response near resonance. Experimental work will be used for parameter identification,\r\nmodel verification, and to explore operating regimes suggested by the analysis.\r\nThe work will focus on the response of individual microbeams and one-dimensional arrays of\r\nmicrobeams, such as those being developed for increased throughput of chemical sensors. These\r\narrays are composed of several nearly identical beams that are weakly coupled to their nearest\r\nneighbors. Systems with these general characteristics are known to experience instabilities and\r\nlocalized responses, wherein synchronization is lost and the vibration energy is concentrated in a\r\nsmall subset of beams. The analytical part of the work will concentrate on how these instabilities\r\nand localization are influenced by system and excitation parameters, and the manner in which they\r\naffect overall performance of the sensor. In addition, analytical models that employ intentional\r\npatterns of mistuning will be considered, which are known to minimize the effects of instability and\r\nlocalization. The experimental work will be used to guide and confirm the analysis, and to test\r\nsystems that are designed to operate in a synchronous manner.\r\nBroader Impacts: An integrated educational plan has been proposed which integrates outreach\r\nwith graduate education. Specifically, the goal would be to incorporate demonstrations and\r\nexplanations of observable phenomena that can be accounted for through an understanding of\r\nnonlinear vibrations and dynamics, as well as topics from microscale and nanoscale engineering, to\r\nexisting outreach programs. The mechanics principles behind simple cantilever sensors can be used\r\nto illustrate how simple physics principles are used to develop sensors, and show practical, exciting\r\napplication of science. At UCSB these programs will be developed through collaborations with local\r\nteachers. At least one of these relationships has already been solidified with a teacher at Santa\r\nBarbara Jr. High. At MSU, this outreach would occur via the MSU High School Engineering\r\nInstitute, which targets secondary school students and actively encourages participation in the\r\nengineering sciences.\r\nBroader impact in graduate education and technology transfer will be achieved in part through\r\npartnerships with Veeco, a local company. Veeco has a long-standing relationship with UCSB.\r\nVeeco is currently a member of the California Nanosystems institute, and has funded graduate\r\nstudent interns at Veeco, including one from the PI's group. Veeco is interested in the technology\r\nwe plan to study in this effort, and will allow students to utilize equipment unavailable at UCSB.\r\nTeaming: The proposed effort is a collaboration between Kimberly Turner (UCSB), Steven Shaw\r\n(MSU), and Jeffrey Moehlis (UCSB), and will be carried out at their home institutions. The students\r\nand PIs on both teams will be involved in all aspects of the project, keeping up to date via electronic\r\ncommunication and by regular visits by the MSU group to the facilities at UCSB.",
