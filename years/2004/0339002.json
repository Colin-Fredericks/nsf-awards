 "awd_abstract_narration": "With prior NSF support, Social Psychology Network (SPN) has become one of the most heavily used Internet sites in scientific psychology. On an average day, the Network's pages are viewed more than 30,000 times by visitors from 75 countries around the world -- a total of more than 22 million page views since SPN was established. The current project will further develop SPN into a web portal with many of the features found in nonacademic web portals, such as customization by users, automatic link-checking, optional email bulletins, and an advanced search capability that relies on an annotated database of more than 10,000 web links. In addition, the Network team will add a new web-based technology for conducting complex \"human-like\" interviews via the Internet. This advanced technology, created by the SPN team for its partner site at eInterview.org, will be capable of changing question wording, response options, and topics depending upon the answers given by interviewees. Together, SPN and its eInterview.org partner site will strengthen the infrastructure of social science research and education, offering new possibilities for global data collection, scholarly communication, and dissemination of research results.",
