 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThe subject of active measurement is described here in the context of a type of measurement\r\nprocesses that has become common in engineering and physics, both at the macro scale\r\nand at the nano scale. Active measurement, or active sensing as it may also be called, is\r\noften used to extend the capabilities of sensors having limited dynamic range or the need\r\nfor a sequence of preparatory steps. We focus on a class of problems of the type that arise\r\nin nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy where the sample must be exposed to\r\nan excitation and the signal-to-noise ratios are very unfavorable. In this setting it often\r\nhappens that the measurements must be repeated and averaged over long periods of time\r\nif one is to get a useful result. When these problems are conceptualized as problems of\r\nminimizing the error variance, an unusual range of diffculties present themselves reflecting\r\nthe nonlinear nature of the problem. These are the subject of this proposal.\r\nIntellectual Merit: It is argued here that in a number of areas the basic insights and\r\nmathematical algorithms needed to obtain the most useful conclusions from an existing\r\nexperimental apparatus are not yet available. In some cases we can conceptualize the\r\nproblem by saying that in the case of stochastic processes, further improvements in the\r\nestimation process depend on determining how to best control the equation governing the\r\nerror variance as it shows up in the Kalman-Bucy fiter equations. It is argued here, perhaps\r\nfor the first time, that active control of this variance is akin to controlling a certain type\r\nof nonlinear systems in that non commutative effects are of critical importance. In this\r\nproposal we explore this idea in the context of NMR problems and find that when used in\r\nconnection with a carefully designed mode selection process it is possible to increase the\r\nsignal to noise ratio significantly. We also argue that these questions are best addressed in a\r\nsomewhat broader context and the proposal seeks to place them in their natural generality.\r\nBroader Impact: The motivation for this work is firmly rooted in real world con-\r\nsiderations. For example, for years it has been felt that the problem of determining the\r\nstructure of individual proteins is of fundamental importance in understanding a wide\r\nrange of diseases and the design of their treatments. NMR spectroscopy is the main tool\r\nfor determining protein structure but the current methods are hampered by the fact that\r\nthe evidence they provide is noisy and indirect. The current methods for designing the\r\nNMR pulses and processing the resulting data have been developed from experience and\r\ninsight, backed up by an excellent understanding of the basic physics of nuclear spin. What\r\nis not well supported by theory is the subsequent signal processing and the interplay be-\r\ntween pulse design and signal processing. An important aspect of this work is to address\r\nthis problem and thus make the process of protein structure determination faster and more\r\naccurate. We also point out that there is under development a new nanometer measure-\r\nment tool that combines aspects of the atomic force microscope with NMR and which is\r\nmay also provide a useful window on key questions in protein structure determination.\r\n1",
