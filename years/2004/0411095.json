Flow cytometry, used extensively in diverse areas of research to analyze fluorescent stained subpopulations of cells, is now sufficiently automated to be suitable for use in undergraduate laboratory courses.  This provides opportunities for student-derived independent research projects.  The goals of the project are to introduce quantitative flow cytometry experiments into the cell biology laboratory, to develop a mini-course focusing on flow cytometry principles, and to increase undergraduate student participation in research.  Approximately 65 students a year are exposed to the technique of flow cytometry, both in cell biology and in the new mini-course.  Project evaluation is both formative and summative and involves both students and faculty.",
