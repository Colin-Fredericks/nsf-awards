 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract: ITR: Novel Wireless Broad-band Communications and Robust Time Synchronization Devices (Proposal No. 0426644)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ITR proposal focuses on interdisciplinary collaborative research to develop and analyze a novel broad-band OFDM system, which involves the integrative design of the distributive algorithms and the time synchronization circuits. A novel pilot-free dynamic adaptive modulation mechanism will be investigated, which is based on the switching capability among blind equalization and channel coders, rather than the existing constellation or symbol-rate switching techniques. The quality-of-service analysis due to the effect of local oscillator fabrication defects will also be studied and justified using the real data and a novel integrative system-on-chip design will be explored to optimize a switchable PLL module. \r\n\r\nIntellectual merits: The scientific knowledge can be added by solving and analyzing some basic problems associated with wireless OFDM systems. The pilot-free dynamic adaptive modulation, the indoor quality-of-service analysis and the switchable PLL design are significant and unsolved problems in the telecommunication research, which will be of great interest to information technology researchers.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: This project will contribute to the technology base of robust wireless OFDM systems. The innovative pilot-free adaptive modulation, indoor quality-of-service analysis tool and integrative system-on-chip switchable PLL will be of great value to information technology. The developed broad-band OFDM system has a genuine potential to be used in real-time wireless networks, digital audio and video broadcasting, which are the essential parts of our daily life. Besides the technological impact, this project also serves to educate the future information technology workforce by directly involving underrepresented graduate and undergraduate students in the cutting-edge wireless communications related research.\r\n",
