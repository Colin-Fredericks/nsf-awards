 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative NSF-03-043, category NIRT. The effort involves a team of materials scientists with complementary expertise in magnetic thin film growth, nanostructure fabrication, mesoscopic physics and magnetic materials. The scientific objective of the research program is to advance the fundamental understanding of spin distributions and spin dynamics, including damping, in nanostructured magnetic materials on picosecond time scales. The development of high-performance ultrahigh-frequency magnetic materials will require new tools for probing and accurately modeling spin distributions on a nanometer spatial scale and spin dynamics on a sub-picosecond time scale. The current research combines technique development (spin-polarized electron scanning tunneling microscopy and femtosecond laser-based spin-dynamics), and novel materials synthesis (self-assembly and template growth) with multi-scale multi-phenomena theory and modeling. Integrated with this are outreach (NSF/UT Austin Research Experience for Undergraduates program) and educational components (new courses in nanotechnology and mesoscopic physics) that will provide new materials and trained personnel required for continued technological advances in magnetic materials.\r\n\r\nThis proposal was received in response to Nanoscale Science and Engineering initiative NSF-03-043 category NIRT. The team consists of materials scientists with complementary expertise in magnetic thin film growth, nanostructure fabrication, theoretical materials physics, and magnetic materials characterization to address new scientific and technological issues that arise in submicrometer scale magnetic structures. The objective is to advance fundamental understanding of relationships between materials properties and magnetic response in microfabricated magnetic materials. Scientific and technological relationships between dimensionality, shape, and structure of nanoparticles and their magnetic properties will be investigated. The effort combines technique development (new high-speed high-spatial resolution probes of magnetic response) with new methods of producing sub-micron magnetic structures (atomic self-assembly), and powerful numerical/theoretical methods for simulating and understanding magnetic response. The research may lead to new magnetic materials with applications using currently unused high-frequency bands in radar, telecommunications, radio astronomy, spectroscopy and imaging. The research is integrated with educational and outreach activities including new graduate level courses covering magnetic nanostructures and technology and undergraduate research experience activities. The program is designed to attract and train the next generation of scientists and engineers required for continued scientific and technological advances in the application of magnetic materials.\r\n",
