 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to experimentally understand the effect of change in morphology and structure of one-dimensional nanowires of Pd and NiFe electrodeposited under different conditions on their function. The focus will be on correlating the effect of morphology, size and formation cycle of nanowires to sensor performance, sensitivity and reversibility.   The effect of changing the following parameters will be studied a) effect of changing the plating parameters and, b) effect of different templates (graphite, polycarbonate, alumina and porous silicon).  \r\n \r\nThe research objectives of this proposal are to quantify the role and importance of nanoparticle/wire (Pd/NiFe) morphology in sensing/separation, by integrating and evaluating (a) the Pd nanowires on flexural Plate Wave Acoustic Sensor (FPW) for near-real time detection of gases, and, b) the magnetic properties of NiFe in cell manipulation/separation experiments.  Research outcomes of this proposal would facilitate the fundamental understanding of using nanowires as sensing/separating elements.  \r\n \r\nSuccessful accomplishment of the research objectives will have far reaching implications in development of field deployable real-time nanoparticle/wire based acoustic sensors for gas/hydrocarbon detection and in integration of biology and nanotechnology in the emerging field of nano bio-magnetics. The existing collaborations with various groups in academia, industry and medical centers will greatly enhance the success of the proposed research. \r\n \r\nThe educational plan consists of two major parts:  Course development and Outreach:  (a) Improve the graduate-level interdisciplinary Chemical/Biological Sensors and Microfabrication course currently taught at University of South Florida, through incorporation of research results.  This new interdisciplinary course has been developed in-part for the IGERT program at USF and draws heavily from the PIs ongoing research. (b) Current outreach extending to the College of   Marine Science and St. Petersburg College will be strengthened. In collaboration with Director of Recruitment and Retention USF, St. Petersburg Junior College, Hillsborough and Pinellas County Education System, PI will develop technology information modules for immersive training experience for teachers in community colleges.  \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit:  Proposed research integrates developments in different research areas (nanostructures, gas sensing and bio-magnetics) in a novel approach that will advance the knowledge and understanding in diverse fields, from understanding to sensing.  The research will provide a basis for quantitative diagnosis in diverse environments. This is a major advance across fields.   \r\n \r\nBroader Impact:  This research will train students in emerging cross-disciplinary areas (Electrical, Chemical Engineering and Physics).  The research is based upon early work of undergraduate student and will have continued participation of undergraduate students and underrepresented groups  (minority, women).  The results of the research will be widely disseminated through inclusion in courses and modules developed by PI, demonstrations and outreach. \r\n     \r\n\r\n",
