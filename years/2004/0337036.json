 "awd_abstract_narration": "Temple University's \"Sisters in Science in the Community (SISCOM)\" is a constructivist-based, inclusive youth/community project targeting underrepresented urban middle and high school girls in grades 6-10 and their families; it supports inclusion of girls with disabilities.  It engages girls and their parents in hands-on, inquiry-based sports science in after-school, Saturday, and summer programs co-hosted by community-based organizations and Temple University.  Girls will also be engaged in student-centered research projects guided by female scientists.  With regard to intellectual merit, SISCOM is based on previous research done by Temple on methods for engaging girls and their parents in STEM activities.  The infrastructure of research and practices in education will be facilitated through the sharing of information between the network of partners and the national community of formal and informal educators",
