For example,\r\nMoore's theorem states that if we take a certain collection of\r\nsets on the 2-sphere and topologically collapse them to points\r\nthen we obtain a new topological sphere.  The PI will investigate\r\nwhen the quotient map can be conformal and will consider a number\r\nof concrete problems from this general perspective, including\r\nconformal welding, characterizations of John domains, Koebe's\r\nconjecture, construction of Kleinian groups and other dynamical\r\nobjects.  The PI will continue his earlier work on the geometry\r\nof Kleinian limit sets and the behavior of the dimension as we\r\ndeform the limit set.  The PI will also continue his work on the\r\nconnections between computational geometry, hyperbolic geometry\r\nand conformal mappings, and seek new algorithms which compute the\r\nRiemann mapping quickly and with rigorous error estimates.  In\r\nparticular he will investigate computing conformal maps using the\r\nmedial axis (an object from computational geometry) which is\r\nclosely linked to 3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry via convex\r\nhulls.\r\n\r\nConformal mappings are important both for their central role in\r\nnumerous mathematical problems (complex analysis, dynamical\r\nsystems,...) and in various applications (fluid flow, brain\r\nmapping, statistical physics, numerical analysis of differential\r\nequations,...), so we must have a good theoretical understanding\r\nof these maps and good methods for computing them in\r\npractice. The proposal deepens our theoretical understanding of\r\nconformal maps by investigating new connections with other parts\r\nof mathematics and computer science (point set topology,\r\n3-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, Voronoi diagrams) and seeks to\r\nuse these connections to invent new algorithms for computing\r\nconformal maps.  For example, the medial axis is a widely studied\r\nobject in computer science (it is a description of the shape on\r\nan object which has numerous applications in pattern recognition,\r\nrobotic motion, biology,...). The PI discovered it can also be\r\nused to give a rough but fast approximation to conformal maps.\r\nThe PI will seek to improve this method, giving better algorithms\r\nfor conformal maps and also developing a better understanding of\r\nthe medial axis which will impact its other applications (for\r\nexample, the medial axis can change drastically when the object\r\nbeing described changes only a little; this is a serious\r\ncomputational problem which can be addressed by thinking of the\r\nmedial axis as an object in hyperbolic geometry instead of the\r\nusual Euclidean geometry). The connection between the medial axis\r\nand conformal maps may also lead to new ideas for studying\r\napplications in three dimensions (where conformal mappings do not\r\nexist, but maps based on the medial axis still do). Three\r\ndimensional problems are the most important for applications, but\r\nour understanding lags far behind the two dimensional case, so\r\nnew two dimensional ideas which generalize to higher dimensions\r\nare important.\r\n",
