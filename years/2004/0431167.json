 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of the proposed research is to develop better algorithms for solving various location\r\nproblems. Sample applications of these problems include sensor localization{where we compute the\r\nlocation of every sensor node in a wireless sensor network, relay node placement{where we compute\r\nthe locations for the placement of the minimum number of more powerful but more expensive\r\nrelay nodes into a sensor network, and amplier placement{where we compute the locations for the\r\nplacement of the minimum number of optical ampliers in a wide area optical network.\r\nLocation in the Euclidean plane is a problem that is well studied by researchers in location\r\nscience and has applications in transportation and logistics. Sensor networks is a booming new re-\r\nsearch field due to its applications in homeland security, medical, and many other areas. Knowledge\r\nof sensor locations can greatly improve various routing algorithms. However, due to the energy\r\nconstraint in sensor networks, GPS can not be used. Also due to the ad hoc nature and the energy\r\nconstraint, localization and other algorithms in wireless sensor networks have to be localized or\r\ndistributed. Therefore it is diffcult to apply traditional location techniques to sensor networks\r\ndirectly.\r\nOne of the goals of the proposed research is to take advantage of the PI's expertise in location\r\ntheory and numerical optimization to design better sensor localization algorithms that are suitable\r\nfor wireless sensor networks. Another goal of the proposed research is to design better algorithms\r\nfor relay node placement using techniques from both numerical and combinatorial optimization.\r\nOur approach to the sensor localization problem is numerical in nature, including investigations\r\nof numerical stability in distributed sensor localization. Our approach to the relay node placement\r\nis combinatorial in nature. Due to the non-convex nature of the program, numerical optimization\r\nis used only for subproblems or for relaxations. It is worth noting that the same problem finds\r\napplications in both relay node placement in a at sensor network, and in amplifier placement in a\r\nwide area optical network. We would like to point out that our research focus is on effective algo-\r\nrithms for solving some basic problems with wide ranges of applications, rather than on hardware\r\nrelated issues of specific applications.\r\nThe Intellectual Merits of this research include: (a) numerical algorithms for sensor local-\r\nization that are more accurate, efficient, and scalable; (b) stability analysis of distributed sensor\r\nlocalization and a methodology for error propagation control that may be used in other distributed\r\nalgorithm such as time synchronization in wireless sensor networks; (c) better algorithms (both\r\nnumerical and combinatorial) for relay node placement and related problems.\r\nThe Broader Impacts of this research include the following: (a) Homeland security{\r\nadvanced localization algorithms can help improve the technology our military. (b) Human\r\nresources{highly skilled graduate students will be trained. (c) Dissemination of research re-\r\nsults through high-quality publications{the PI is actively publishing in high quality journals\r\nand conferences.",
