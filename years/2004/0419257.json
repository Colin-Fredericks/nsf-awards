 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a\r\nnovel integrated reactive abatement module (IRAM) that effectively removes solidifying\r\nchemicals from the exhaust effluent of deposition and etch manufacturing processes. Growing\r\nsafety concerns and escalating costs dedicated to environmental protection is one of the drivers to\r\ncontinuously migrate semiconductor manufacturing outside of the US.  In this project,\r\nhazardous chemicals will be reactively converted into inert solid films over a removable high-area filtration element. An integrated high-speed downstream pressure control will actively\r\nsuppress IRAM-induced pressure fluctuations that may affect the process. The reactive process\r\nwill apply highly effective chemical reactions to convert the solidifying chemicals into stable\r\ninert films. Objectives include superior maintainability of low-pressure exhaust manifolds and\r\npumps and substantially improved safety of device processing systems, hence promoting safe and\r\nenvironmentally benign semiconductor manufacturing at a competitive cost.\r\n\r\nBroader impact: Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and\r\nReactive Ion Etching (RIE) are considered the cornerstones of semiconductor manufacturing\r\ntechnology. In the last decade these manufacturing-technologies have also migrated into the\r\nexplosively growing area of nano-technology. These process techniques emit reactive, toxic and\r\nsolidifying chemicals and produce a hazardous and destructive residue in low-pressure exhaust\r\nmanifolds that clogs up the conduits and destroys the vacuum pumps. Slow and inefficient\r\nchemical reactions, driven by the typically low pressure and low temperature conditions in\r\nexhaust manifolds, convert the reactive exhaust mixture into hazardous residue instead of\r\ncompletely reacted inert films. Frequent maintenance requires ambient exposure of these\r\nhazardous-residue-containing exhaust manifolds with risks to the workers and the workplace.\r\nGrowing safety concerns and escalating cost dedicated to environmental protection severely\r\nhampers the semiconductor industry and reduces its competitiveness in the US. Overcoming this\r\ndeficiency, IRAM technology will apply environmentally benign chemistry with a localized\r\nproduction of short-lived highly reactive species capable to completely extracting the solidifying\r\nchemicals out of exhaust streams to produce inert solid films. This novel chemistry has a broad\r\nrange of device processing applications and can positively impact manufacturing costs.\r\nKey Words: CVD, RIE, ALD, abatement, semiconductor manufacturing, LPCVD, foreline,\r\nEH&S, environmental health and safety.\r\nE.B.A 5/24/04\r\n",
