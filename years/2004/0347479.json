 "awd_abstract_narration": "0347479\r\nFerris\r\nThis five-year CAREER Development project will examine the biomechanics and energetics of human locomotion with powered lower limb exoskeletons. The Human Neuromechanics Laboratory at The University of Michigan has developed carbon fiber lower limb exoskeletons that can comfortably supply active torque assistance at the ankle, knee, and hip during walking and running. Artificial pneumatic muscles attached to a carbon fiber shell provide high power outputs while minimizing exoskeleton weight. Myoelectrical signals from biological muscles control force in the artificial muscles in a physiologically appropriate manner. Although the exoskeletons are limited to laboratory use because they require a large source of compressed air, they are ideal for studying human responses to powered locomotor assistance. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the research plan is to quantify the effects of powered assistance on the energetics of walking and running. The investigators will measure the metabolic efficiency of external power assistance at the ankle, knee, and hip during walking and running over a range of speeds and added loads. The results will provide important insight into the mechanical factors that determine the metabolic cost of locomotion and much needed guidance for creation of future lower limb exoskeletons. The biomechanical and metabolic benefit of adding external power to the ankle vs. knee vs. hip will be quantified. These data will be instrumental in performing cost-benefit analyses of actuator and exoskeleton design for gait rehabilitation and human performance augmentation. \r\n\r\nThe objective of the educational plan is to use exoskeleton research to introduce problem-based discovery learning into the curriculum of students preparing for health science careers.  The plan includes: a) creating an upper division course on gait biomechanics that incorporates hands-on experimentation and testing related to exoskeletons for human augmentation and rehabilitation, b) recruiting and training female and minority undergraduate students for exoskeleton research projects in the Human Neuromechanics Laboratory, and c) creating an interactive web page on robotic exoskeletons that can be used as an educational resource for secondary and undergraduate students. \r\n",
