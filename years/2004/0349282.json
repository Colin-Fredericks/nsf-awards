 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will characterize the physical and chemical properties of carbonaceous particles generated in the combustion of solid fuels.  Particles from these sources have received less attention than from other sources, but are estimated to account for roughly 2/3 of the global emissions.  The project will involve a mixture of laboratory and field studies that include examining the emissions from fuels in various stages of combustion using a two-stage pyrolytic reactor developed in this study, analyzing samples collected from locations for which solid fuels are widely used (primarily third world Asian countries) to compare with the laboratory results, and development of schemes for incorporation of these results into models.\r\n\r\nThe work plan includes a broad goal to improve understanding of international air-quality issues for students and the general public.  Observations and data analysis will be incorporated into a class that will include discussion and application of statistical methods.  The concept of emission inventories will be used along with a database query model as a tool to demonstrate the impacts of various types and locations of emissions on atmospheric particulate content.  This model will also be made available as a web-based tool.  Guest lecturers, with expertise on international air quality issues, will be invited to the PI's institution to interact with students in the department and with members of the wider university community.  Two graduate students will receive training under this program.  This research will lead to better representation of carbon-containing particles in chemical transport models.  Links between the fields of combustion and atmospheric chemistry will be improved, and collaborations between international researchers and non-profit organizations will be enhanced.  The facility for generating combustion-based particles will be useful to the community for calibration and instrument intercomparison.",
