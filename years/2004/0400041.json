Project activities include faculty professional development, postdoctoral researchers, visiting scientists, student outreach, student assistantships, supplies, and research equipment.\r\n\r\nResearch in optics & photonics will focus on luminescent materials development and nonlinear optical spectroscopy of oxide nanoparticles. Outcomes of this research impact a wide range of technological developments in the area of electro-optics and lasers. This research also advances the fundamental understanding of structure-property relations in luminescent materials and provides deeper insight in the nonlinear optical properties of nanoparticles.\r\nThe multi-disciplinary nature of the program will enhance the quality of education and research in several science and engineering disciplines at Hampton University. Educational enhancement activities include curriculum development in optics and photonics, student research experiences, outreach, and the development of student internships with external partners.\r\n",
