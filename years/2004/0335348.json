SURESHKUMAR\r\nINSTITUTION:\t\t\tUNIVERSITY OF CAL - BERKELEY, WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\nFLOW TRANSITIONS AND TURBULENCE IN THE TAYLOR-COUETTE FLOW OF DILUTE POLYMER SOLUTIONS\r\n\r\nThis is a study of polymer-induced effects on flow transitions, turbulence, and drag reduction in curvilinear flows.  Under this grant, a combined experimental and numerical modeling approach will be undertaken to provide complementary information and allow direct, quantitative comparisons of experiments and direct numerical simulation results.  This will yield faithful modeling and simulation tools to describe the interaction between polymer chains and nonlinear flow states, guidance regarding important parameter ranges to study, insight into the types of flow structures and polymer chain architectures important in drag reduction, and provide quantitative information about the mechanisms of polymer-induced turbulent drag reduction.  This study will advance understanding of friction control in large scale fluid transportation systems and guide the development of polymeric additives that will lead to drag reduction. In addition, the knowledge of how polymers induce qualitative and quantitative changes in fluid flow and drag will help develop polymer-mimetic technologies for designing energy-efficient mixing devices and drag reduction systems for ships and submarines that could result in enormous savings in fuel costs.  In addition to the potential for energy savings, broader impacts in the areas of processing of macromolecules in microfluidic devices and in the optimization of conventional polymer mixing and processing operations are also anticipated. In addition, the PI's will develop an undergraduate transport laboratory module and website based on Taylor-Couette flow.  The website, in addition to summarizing the research results, will include flow visualization movies aimed at introducing basic ideas of flow stability, turbulence, and the effects of polymers on flow to high school and undergraduate students.  \r\n",
