 "awd_abstract_narration": "AST-0407425\r\nPierce\r\n\r\nThis project will measure the rotation curves of a large sample of disk galaxies at relatively nearby redshifts, with the goal of characterizing the mass distribution function and its evolution.  Recent technical developments, specifically Volume-Phase Holographic (VPH) spectrographs, make such kinematic surveys feasible on telescopes such as the Wyoming 2.3-meter.  This project is based at the University of Wyoming and involves the team responsible for the new spectrograph, and can therefore obtain the necessary large amounts of telescope time required for this survey.  The research will take three approaches: comparison of the Tully-Fisher relation (an empirical correlation between luminosity and rotation curve amplitude) for intermediate (S0) and late-type galaxies, detailed velocity curves to constrain mass as a function of radius, and use of the circular velocity distribution function to characterize the mass function.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the development of VPH spectrographs presents new educational opportunities for small telescope users.  This study will evaluate this educational potential by designing and building a suitable example instrument, with the secondary goals of enhancing teaching and hands-on undergraduate experience, and of introducing amateur astronomers to the possibilities of astronomical spectroscopy.  This may lead to significant contributions to several fields of research.",
