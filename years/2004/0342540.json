 "awd_abstract_narration": "The standardization of Message Passing Interface (MPI) has resulted in a \r\nlarge number of applications being developed using MPI. The current MPI \r\nstandard hides network details and provides a simple interface for communication. While these features ease the task of parallel programming, \r\nthey limit communication optimization opportunities. Specifically,\r\nwith the current MPI, communication optimizations can be performed \r\neither by the compiler or in the library implementation. In both cases,\r\noptimizations are limited. Optimizations performed by the compiler \r\nmust be architecture independent since the library hides architectural \r\ndetails from the compiler. Optimizations in the library implementation \r\nare usually architecture dependent. However, such optimizations can \r\nonly be applied to each individual routine.\r\n\r\nIn this research, we propose to optimize MPI programs through compiled \r\ncommunication. By simultaneously using the application communication \r\ninformation and the system architecture information to perform \r\ncommunication optimizations, compiled communication overcomes the\r\nlimitations in the traditional communication system. We will accomplish the \r\nproposed work by developing systems that allow programmers \r\nto write regular portable MPI programs and enjoy the high communication \r\nperformance achieved through compiled communication. The systems \r\ncan also be used to optimize existing MPI programs. We will concentrate \r\non two related parts of this research: extending the MPI standard by \r\nadding new routines to support compiled communication, and developing a \r\nrestructuring compiler that analyzes an MPI program and transforms the \r\nprogram into one that employs the compiled communication technique. \r\nWe will also develop techniques for applying compiled communication to \r\nirregular problems and investigate the interaction between the library \r\nand the compiler support for compiled communication. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
