 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future communication systems will be required to operate very close to\r\ntheir theoretical limits and achieve high performance with limited\r\nresources (e.g., bandwidth, energy, complexity). In order to realize\r\nthese goals, the receiver of a communication system should be able to\r\ndecode the digital data in the presence of channel uncertainty (e.g.,\r\nunknown channel quality, interference, etc.). The current state of\r\nknowledge regarding the complexity of these receivers is that their\r\ncomplexity grows exponentially with the sequence length. This is\r\nunacceptable when practical implementation of these algorithms is of\r\ninterest. A number of fundamental questions thus arise: (i) How\r\naccurate is the conventional wisdom that complexity grows\r\nexponentially with the sequence length?  (ii) What is the impact of\r\nthe above question on the design of near-optimal, approximate\r\nalgorithms suited for ultra-fast integrated circuit implementation?\r\n(iii) How can the complexity/performance tradeoff of these approximate\r\nalgorithms be analyzed, and how can it be improved?\r\n\r\nThis research addresses the aforementioned fundamental questions\r\nusing a novel approach in looking at the problem of joint data\r\ndetection and channel estimation, consisting of two main thrusts: (a)\r\nOn the theoretical front, the current state of knowledge is challenged,\r\nby investigating a broad class of communication scenarios for which\r\nthe exact solution can be obtained with only polynomial complexity.\r\n(b) Utilizing the constructive proofs of the aforementioned statements,\r\na family of novel receivers is investigated with near-optimal\r\nperformance, linear complexity, and moreover, algorithmic structure\r\nthat is suitable for high-speed hardware implementation.\r\n",
