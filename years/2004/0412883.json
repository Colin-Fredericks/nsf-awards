 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will partially support a Geological Society of America Penrose conference for 65 participants on Mass Redistribution in Continental Magmatic- Hydrothermal Systems, to be held September 6 to 11, 2004, at Yellowstone, WY and Butte, MT. The conference is direct response to the recommendations of the one-day workshop on the future of mineral deposits research sponsored by NSF. The Penrose conference is designed to provide a forum for discussion of how large-scale magmatic-hydrothermal systems that operate in the continental crust produce enormous geochemical redistributions of elements that sometimes result in economic mineral deposits. The goal of the Penrose conference is to bring together a spectrum of researchers to present data and hypotheses relevant to magmatic-hydrothermal systems, which (after magmas) result in the largest amount of mass-transfer in the earth's crust, and consequently contribute significantly to the chemical heterogeneity of the earth. Researchers with diverse expertise will examine what we know about these mass transfer processes, what we wish to know in the future, and how we should set about obtaining and analyzing the requisite new data. The primary reason for convening this conference is to accelerate dissemination of ideas from disparate sub-fields that will enhance individual and collaborative research opportunities. The organizers intend the conference as a fertile cross-pollenation, in which mineral deposits experts with detailed understanding of magmatic and hydrothermal ores that represent the end products of mass transfer can interact with researchers who focus on key processes and techniques, including igneous processes at all levels in the crust, driving forces and paths for fluid flow in the crust, and physicochemical parameters that facilitate mass transfer between phases. An interchange of current information and ideas between these groups of researchers will result in a synergy of research efforts and lead to insights into important new research directions. To that end, the organizers have invited researchers from a broad range of disciplines to participate and contribute to the conference. All participants will be expected to give an oral, poster, or field trip presentation. Publicity is currently underway via paper and web media, and conference results will be summarized in a short article in GSA Today after the conference. \r\n\r\nIn terms of broader impacts, this award will support the attendance of some graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, and expose them to international researchers, involve them in cutting edge scientific debates, and allow them to contribute their research to discussions. The funds will also allow some international experts to attend the conference and contribute. \r\n",
