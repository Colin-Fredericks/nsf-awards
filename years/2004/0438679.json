The proposal was submitted in response to the Partnerships for Innovation Program Solicitation (NSF-04556).\r\n\r\nPartners\r\nThe partners include Middle Tennessee State University (Lead Institution), Tennessee Department of Transportation, American Concrete Institute International, American Concrete Pavement Association, American Society of Concrete Contractors, Concrete Foundations Association, Hanley Wood, LLD, National Concrete Masonry Association, National Precast Concrete Association, National Readymix Association, Portland Cement Association, Precast/Prestressed Concrete Institute, Primedia, Inc., and Tilt-up Concrete Association. \r\n\r\nThe primary objective is to train technical concrete professionals who understand both the chemistry of concrete mixtures and the concrete business. The proposed activities will address the technical workforce needs in the concrete industry. No other 4-year institution in the nation is addressing the workforce needs for technically trained professionals within the concrete industry. The goals include:  (1) select two comprehensive universities with strong engineering technology programs and potential for strong industry partnerships; (2) create a Concrete Industry Management (CIM) program at each institution, train faculty, administrators, and concrete professionals, establish the CIM program complete with curriculum; and (3) assist the new programs in developing a student-recruitment program and building strong industry relationships. The four-year CIM curriculum will be based on science and mathematics, with a heavy dose of business courses.\r\n\r\nPotential Economic Impact\r\n\r\nThe concrete industry is a multi-faceted 130 billion dollar industry that is the foundation of the 931 billion dollar construction industry. The concrete industry includes ready-mix, masonry, pre-stressed, pre-cast, contracting equipment manufacturing and materials suppliers to name a few. The concrete industry employs approximately 2 million workers, ranging from low-skilled laborers to PhD. Research scientists. The industry is making an effort to modernize with technology insertion. The industry estimates that there are 1000 openings for managers with an engineering degree in concrete technology and a knowledge of the business side of the industry. To date, approximately 50 graduates are produced per year from one institution. This effort will provide two additional degree-granting institutions to provide the manpower needed to support this industry and keep it competitive worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project lies in the continued development of a technical curriculum for the concrete industry with an appropriate mix of business management courses, the involvement of industry representatives in design of curriculum that continues to evolve with the increasingly technical evolution of the industry.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the activity concentrate on the education infrastructure needed to sustain the concrete/construction industry, as well as providing a diverse workforce.\r\n",
