 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of the planning project is to conduct self-assessments and external research that will result in the development of a full HBCU-UP implementation proposal, which will include an institutional model and action plan to improve STEM instruction. The proposed planning grant will: (1) explore successful methodologies for mastering basic mathematics skills of freshmen who enter college under-prepared for college-level mathematics; (2) review best practices in mathematics and other STEM gatekeeper courses among selected HBCUs, including textbook selection and other learning resources; and (3) prepare a full HBCU-UP implementation proposal. \r\n\r\nIn the planning phase, site visits to one or more HBCUs that have received 5-year HBCU-UP awards will be made and student assistants will work with the PI and Co-PI to distribute and collect a survey instrument to ascertain best practices among selected HBCUs.  A consultant will be utilized to analyze the data and provide advice with respect to preparation of the full proposal.  An internal Advisory Committee will also provide guidance with respect to the planning process.\r\n\r\nAlthough Lane College students no longer take developmental courses based on an evaluation of student success after taking the course, many students are not ready for college-level reading and mathematics upon entry.  Many of these students are under-prepared for college-level mathematics, and are expected to bridge their learning gap in the course MAT 135 College Algebra a five-credit hour course that meets daily. The planning grant will assist the College in conducting research with respect to best practices for bridging the gap in mathematics skills of its entering freshmen, while encouraging them to pursue and persist in STEM majors through graduation at the same time. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe intellectual merit of a full HBCU-UP implementation project on STEM programs at Lane College would include: 1. Bridging the gap in mathematics skills of its entering freshmen, while encouraging them to pursue and persist in STEM majors through graduation at the same time; 2. Increasing the number of STEM majors who have significant research experience at the undergraduate level, and enter graduate school with stronger portfolios; 3. Improving participation of STEM faculty in research experiences that involve the students and other faculty development activities; and 4. Developing a stronger curriculum in Algebra and all STEM gatekeeper courses. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact \r\nEnrollment at Lane College for fall 2003 is 952, ninety-eight percent of whom are African American, and 60% of whom are Tennessee residents.   \r\n\r\nThe broader impact of a full HBCU-UP implementation project on STEM programs at Lane College would include: 1. Increasing the number of African American students matriculating at Lane College who complete STEM majors; 3. Increasing the number of African American students who pursue the 2-3 Engineering program with Tennessee State University; and 4. Increasing the number of freshman STEM majors who participate in summer pre-college science programs. \r\n\r\n",
