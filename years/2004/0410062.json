 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to develop mathematical principles\r\nand new methodologies for problems in and applications of digital\r\nimage processing, and study their associated mathematical foundations.\r\nThe emphasis is on combining partial differential equation (PDE)\r\ntechniques with multi-resolution wavelet representations.\r\nIn particular, we focus on two different image processing applications:\r\nwavelet inpainting (filling in missing or damaged wavelet coefficients),\r\nand PDE image compression. To achieve the tasks, we will integrate several\r\nhigh level mathematical tools including geometrical PDE's,\r\nmulti-resolution harmonic analysis and variational frameworks\r\ntogether with some state-of-the-art engineering methods in image\r\ncoding, such as group testing wavelet (GTW) algorithms for image\r\ncompression. The key is to exploit the power of multi-resolution\r\nproperties of wavelets while at the same time use PDE techniques to\r\nsystematically and explicitly control the geometrical information\r\nin the image so that salient features, such as edges and corners,\r\ncan be recovered in the reconstructions. Efficient computation algorithms\r\nwill be designed and analyzed.\r\n\r\nImage compression and inpainting are two typical tasks of image\r\nprocessing. Due to the large number of pixels of digital images,\r\nmost of them have to be stored in compressed format. The current\r\ninternational compression standard (JPEG2000), which is largely\r\nbased on wavelet representation, is one of the most popular schemes.\r\nImage compression has been used everywhere in our daily life, examples\r\ninclude images transmitted on the Internet, wireless communications,\r\nmedical images (such as MRI), satellite images. Efficient compression\r\nmethods are highly desirable and the universal goal is to represent the\r\nmost salient features (typically geometrical structures) using minimal\r\npossible resources. This is one of the objectives of this project.\r\nImage inpainting refers to automatic procedures to fill\r\nin incomplete, missing or damaged image information. Such loss\r\nis often unavoidable in many applications such as wireless\r\ntransmission, intelligence, homeland security (airports' screening),\r\nrobotic path finding in unknown environment, three-dimensional\r\nobject reconstruction from two-dimensional medical images. Because\r\nmany digital images are stored in wavelet formats, and damages to such\r\nformatted images correspond to loss of wavelet coefficients,\r\nwavelet inpainting demands special attention.  Again, a key objective\r\nin filling in the missing information is to restore missing\r\ngeometrical properties. We will investigate new models and methods for\r\nwavelet inpainting and related mathematical theories.\r\n\r\n",
