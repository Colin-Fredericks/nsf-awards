 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless channel is a challenging communications medium with relatively low capacity per\r\nunit bandwidth, random amplitude and phase uctuations due to multipath time-selective fading,\r\nintersymbol interference due to delay spread and multipaths, and interference from other users\r\ndue to the broadcast nature of the radio channel. The physical link design goal is to achieve data\r\nrates close to the fundamental information capacity limits of the channel. Recent results have\r\nshown that MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) channels with multiple transmit and receive\r\nantennas are capable of achieving enormous capacity gains over single antenna channels. This\r\nhas spurred key advances in space-time processing to capitalize on increased Shannon capacity.\r\nAccurate knowledge of the CSI (channel state information) of MIMO systems is a prerequisite for\r\nmost MIMO physical layer approaches. Traditionally a training sequence, in lieu of the information\r\nsequence, is transmitted during the acquisition mode to enable the receiver to design an equalizer or\r\nestimate the channel in the presence of the aforementioned uncertainties. In the fast time-varying\r\ncase, the training sequences may have to be transmitted periodically. For a given bandwidth, use\r\nof training sequences decreases the effective information rate. In blind channel estimation (system\r\nidentification) and equalization no training sequences are available or used. In semi-blind channel\r\nestimation approaches, a combination of training and information sequence-based data is used so\r\nthat in addition to the training-based data, one also exploits the information in the rest of the\r\nreceived signal. In superimposed training-based approach the training sequence is \\on\" all the time\r\nand is transmitted (at low power) concurrently with (superimposed on) the information sequence.\r\nThis proposal is concerned with all such three techniques for channel estimation for both single user\r\nand multiple users systems and for both time-invariant frequency-selective channels and frequency-\r\nand time- selective fading channels.\r\nIdentification of fast-varying nonstationary processes is best handled via structured nonsta-\r\ntionarities. Our initial focus is on time-varying channels described by a discrete-time complex\r\nexponential basis expansion model (CE-BEM) resulting in either a single-input multiple-output\r\n(SIMO) time-varying linear system for single user systems or a multiple-input multiple-output\r\n(MIMO) linear system for multiuser systems. For wireless channels such canonical models can be\r\nderived based on certain physical parameters such as signal bandwidth, channel Doppler spread and\r\nmultipath spread, up to some unknown time-invariant constants. Other modeling approaches such\r\nas wavelet and polynomial bases, will also be considered. We are investigating blind, semi-blind\r\nand superimposed training-based system identification techniques for SIMO and MIMO channel es-\r\ntimation, multiuser interference suppression, and equalization and detection of desired user's signal\r\nover asynchronous frequency- and/or time-selective fading channels.\r\nThe intellectual merit of the proposed research lies in its focus on some fundamental modeling,\r\nsignal design and channel estimation issues that cut across several applications areas (e.g. wireless\r\ncommunications systems and networks, radio communications, and underwater acoustics). Both\r\ntheoretical and applications aspects are being considered.\r\nThe broader impact of the project lies in graduate education of underrepresented groups,\r\nresearch at an EPSCoR institution, participation of students in professional society meetings, and\r\ndissemination of the research results through teaching at both undergraduate and graduate levels\r\n(particularly the courses that are part of the newly established Bachelor of Wireless Engineering\r\ndegree program at Auburn University).\r\nA-1",
