 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research:  Testing and Analyses of  Nonrectangular Walls Under Multi- Directional Loads -- CMS 0324504\r\n\r\nPI: Cathy French, University of Minnesota\r\n\r\nThis project represents a collaborative analytical, experimental and educational effort to investigate the \r\nbehavior of nonrectangular structural walls subjected to the effects of multidirectional loading. \r\nNonrectangular structural walls are often used to resist lateral loads and limit deformations in structural \r\nsystems located in regions of moderate and high seismicity. Although such wall systems are intended to \r\nresist the lateral forces along the orthogonal axes of the building, past research has been limited to \r\nunidirectional studies of these systems due to limitations in experimental capabilities, as such the \r\nnumerical models developed to describe their behavior have been calibrated to this limited data. The \r\nproposed project employs one of the first applications of an NSF George E. Brown, Jr., Network for \r\nEarthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES) large-scale testing facility, the Multi-Axial Subassemblage \r\nTesting (MAST) System at the University of Minnesota, to achieve the multidirectional testing \r\nrequirements. This facility is ideal for the investigation as it is capable of six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) \r\ncontrol including the ability to specify moment to shear profiles about each orthogonal axis to simulate \r\nthe distribution of lateral forces applied to the wall system. It is anticipated that multidirectional loads will \r\nhave a significant impact on the behavior of these nonrectangular wall systems as they are intended to \r\nresist lateral forces and limit deformations along the orthogonal axes of the building. The collaborative \r\nteam of researchers from the University of Minnesota, Iowa State University, University of Puerto Rico at \r\nMayaguez and The Nakaki Bashaw Group, Inc., a consulting firm in Irvine, California, bring combined \r\nstrengths and resources in experimentation, analysis, design practice and education, all of which are \r\nessential components of the proposed investigation. All collaborative researchers will remotely participate \r\nin the experimentation including the operation of the test which will reside with Iowa State University. \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit:  This project builds on the combined strengths of the collaborative research team and \r\nnewly available experimental capabilities to investigate a critical structural element for seismic regions, \r\nnonrectangular structural walls. The analytical and experimental studies developed in this project are \r\nexpected to lead to improved understanding of the behavior, analysis techniques, and design of \r\nnonrectangular wall systems. The project will also recommend appropriate modifications to the design \r\nand detailing of nonrectangular wall elements suggested in the current building codes. \r\n \r\nBroader Impact:  The project has a significant educational component through plans to incorporate the \r\ntesting and simulation into the curriculum at the three collaborative universities including the \r\nparticipation of underrepresented groups. The involvement of the practicing engineer from the beginning \r\nof the project, who along with the Principal Investigator is involved in the development of the American \r\nConcrete Institute Building Code, ensures that the appropriate research findings may be translated directly \r\ninto practice with improved detailing recommendations for nonrectangular structural walls. As such, this \r\nproject will improve the nation's infrastructure in seismic regions. It is also anticipated that the results of \r\nthis project will lead to valuable information for future remote users of the MAST system. This \r\ninformation will include documentation of any observed deformations of the reaction wall and crosshead, \r\nas well as the ability of the system to function under mixed mode control with large applied forces. The \r\nperformance and userability evaluations of the remote participant capabilities within the MAST are \r\nintended to lead to an improved system for remote participation. The Co-PIs have a vested interest within \r\nthis project to actively evaluate these capabilities as they are essential to their participation in this project. \r\nIt is intended that the research data be made available to the research community through the NSF, \r\nGeorge E. Brown Jr., NEES National Data Repository. Any hardware or instrumentation purchased at the \r\nUniversity of Minnesota through this project will be available to future users of the MAST facility. \r\n",
