 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemistry (12)   Our objective in this project is to improve both the educational and technical quality of our undergraduate teaching laboratories. We are converting our 60 MHz continuous-wave NMR spectrometer to an Anasazi Fourier transform NMR spectrometer.\r\nIntellectual Merit:  As we integrate FT-NMR spectroscopy throughout the chemistry curriculum, our educational goal is to re-design the laboratory sections of the courses by using research-based pedagogy that has been shown to be more effective in helping students confront misconceptions and engage in high-level reasoning activities, resulting in a better conceptual understanding.  We are incorporating a carefully selected sequence of NMR experiments into all levels of the undergraduate chemistry curriculum by adapting experiments from the educational literature, primarily from the Journal of Chemical Education.  RESEARCH?\r\nBroader Impacts:  FT-NMR spectroscopy is a major diagnostic tool of modern chemistry and chemistry graduates are expected to have had significant experience in collecting and interpreting NMR spectra. By the end of their senior year, chemistry majors will have experienced a broad range NMR applications and techniques.  Results will be disseminated through a web site, presentations at professional meetings, and publications in journals.\r\n",
