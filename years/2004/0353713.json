 "awd_abstract_narration": "A symposium entitled \"Regulatory genes and the evolution of plant phenotype\" will be held at the Evolution 2003 meeting in Fort Collins, Colorado, June 25-29, 2004. The symposium will feature speakers at a variety of career stages from graduate students to full professors. The speakers will explore a number of topics related to the role of developmental regulatory genes in morphological evolution. Additionally, they will bring five undergraduates, primarily from underrepresented minorities, to the conference. The symposium will enhance communication among plant evolutionary developmental biologists and between plant and animal biologists.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts: The conference will enhance the cohesion of the field of plant evolutionary developmental biology and support the career advancement of a number of young scientists. Additionally, the engagement of undergraduates in such a scientific conference will contribute to the recruitment of the best students (especially minority students) into the scientific career track.\r\n",
