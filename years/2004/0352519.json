 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Instructional Modules in Educational Measurement and Statistics for School Personnel\" project will be produced in dynamic video cases and DVD for use in updating school administrators', counselors' and teachers' knowledge about tests, measurement, score reports and interpretation.  This new knowledge will enable schools to inform curriculum and instructional decision-making, improve classroom practices and better respond to the strengths and needs of individual students.  These materials will help bridge an existing gap in assessment literacy by helping teachers, administrators and parents to interpret test score results and to understand the underlying measurement principles essential to making meaning of these results.  Extensive survey data and text analysis will be used to identify widely held misconceptions about testing and measurement concepts.  Pilot and field-testing will be targeted to gain feedback on how well the new materials communicate and translate the core concepts of score distributions, individual and average test scores and interpretation of widely used score reports to teachers.  This unique and timely project will produce high quality materials on assessment that will have immediate applicability and that will be of broad interest.\r\n",
