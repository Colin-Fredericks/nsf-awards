 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nHudson, Md\r\n0412161\r\nThis international travel grant will support  eleven graduate students to attend the 2004 Quadrennial Ozone Symposium of the International Ozone Commission of the International Association for Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics (IAMAP) of the IUGG.  The Symposium will be held from June 1-8, 2004 at Kos, Greece, and it will cover all aspects of the study of ozone in the Stratosphere and the Troposphere. This outstanding symposium attracts a large number of the world's best atmospheric chemists and others in related fields, e.g., climate.  It is expected that over 500 scientists will attend the 2004 Symposium, as the subjects of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone are of great topical interests. Of these attendees it is estimated that about one third will be graduate students. \r\n\r\nThe student candidates for support will be requested to submit the following to the Symposium Awards Committee:\r\n(1) A letter requesting travel support together with the abstract of her/his\r\npaper by January 31, 2004.\r\n(2) one letter of recommendation\r\n(3) a short curriculum vitae\r\n(4) A letter showing that he/she is a graduate student of good standing at\r\na university within the United States of America.\r\n\r\nFirst priority will be given to those students who are the principal author of a\r\npaper/poster\r\n\r\nBroader impacts:\tFor students, attending the symposium is a motivating experience.   It presents a rare educational opportunity for them to discuss their individual research with leaders in the field other than their immediate advisor\r\n",
