 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continuing support via the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution will permit U.S. ocean scientists in the academic research community to participate in specific activities of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). ICES is one of the foremost intergovernmental organizations concerned with marine science. ICES promotes and coordinates research by experts within its nineteen member countries on both sides of the Atlantic. The U.S. has been a member since 1912 (with a break during and after WWII). The U.S. role in ICES has become more important with the years, as major practical concerns such as fisheries and pollution have become oceanic in scale and in research programs. NSF has traditionally supported participation of academic U.S. scientists in committees, working groups, and scientific sessions under the auspices of ICES and SCOR, where their input is most beneficial to U.S. fisheries and ocean research interests. Through this proposal U.S. scientists from the academic research community will be selected and funded to attend ICES Working Groups and Statutory Meetings in 2004-2007.",
