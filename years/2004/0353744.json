 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a three-year REU Site at Rowan University. Eight students will be recruited from throughout the U.S. for an eight-week summer experience in research related to pollution prevention and sustainability. Both of these research areas are intimately related to gaining a better understanding of the natural environment. A well-qualified, multidisciplinary team of faculty will serve as mentors to the REU student participants. REU activities will include not only research but also field trips; seminars; social activities to build a sense of community amongst the student participants and research mentors; and technical writing instruction. The program will serve to encourage undergraduates to pursue advanced degrees in engineering and thus impact the nations need to increase the number of U.S. citizens and permanent residents engaged in research-related careers. It is also anticipated that this REU Site will have a Broader Impact on the nations need to have broader participation in the research enterprise of citizens and permanent residents from demographic groups traditionally underrepresented in science and engineering.",
