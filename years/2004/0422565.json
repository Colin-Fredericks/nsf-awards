The U.S. organizer is Dr. Hussein Abdel-Wahab, Department of Computer Science at Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia.  The Egyptian co-organizer is Dr. Mohamed Ismail, Department of Electrical Engineering, Alexandria University, Egypt.  ISCC is a well-established international conference.  Scientists and students from the USA and the Middle East will be participating.  Topics to be covered will include: Agent and Knowledge Base Technology; Data Mining; Real-Time Communications Services; Mobil Ad-hoc and Sensor Networks; Multimedia Information management and Exchange; Overlay and Programmable Networks, and Security and Cryptography.  It is expected that the two sides will discuss advances in these areas and recommend areas for mutually beneficial collaborative projects\r\n\r\nScope:  This joint workshop will result in new insights into research issues and could potentially impact the global economy through improvements in communications and computer utilization. Students from the U.S. and from the Middle East region will be invited to participate. The participating scientists and students will get an international perspective on research issues. A small part of funding is for the travel of Middle East students and researchers. The interaction is likely to lead to more collaboration with M.E. researchers and students.  Students, especially women students, from the M.E. may get motivated to come to the U.S. country for education.  The workshop may provide support for technical development in the host country and region. \r\n",
