 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThe proposed research will investigate the feasibility of using Wire Mesh\r\nReinforced Inorganic Matrix (WMRIM) as blast-resistant retrofits for unreinforced\r\nmasonry walls. The proposed work is part of full-scale blast tests based on\r\nGlass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) retrofits. Through full-scale blast testing, we\r\nwill experimentally validate a methodology for designing WMRIM retrofits as a cost-\r\neffective solution to blast resistant retrofits. The results of this research will enable\r\nretrofit techniques to be designed based on simple static tests on structural\r\ncomponents rather than more expensive blast tests on full-scale structures.\r\nThe hypothesis of the research is that the initial blast wave causes significant\r\ndamage to masonry walls. This phenomenon and the subsequent stiffening of the wall due to arch action need to be characterized to adequately model blast effect on\r\nstructures. The key elements of this research are:\r\ni) Wire-mesh Reinforced Inorganic Matrix (WMRIM\r\nii) Static Flexure Tests and\r\niii) Blast Pressure Response Model\r\nBroader Impact\r\nApproximately 40% of the budget will leverage planned full-scale blast tests by\r\nEMRTC to obtain test data for our WMRP retrofits. Over 70% of the remaining\r\nbudget for this research will directly support graduate student training. The University\r\nof New Mexico is a minority institution (Hispanic and American Indian). The PI has\r\nalways had a significant ( 40%) number of minority graduate students in his research\r\nprogram. The full-scale explosive test facilities are located in Socorro, 1 hour drive\r\nfrom the University of New Mexico campus. This synergy couldallow the university to build a strong reputation in the design and testing of hardened\r\n(blast-resistant) structures and provide needed information for blast resistant design.\r\n\r\n",
