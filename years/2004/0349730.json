 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will advance  the performance of light  emitting  diodes  based  on semiconductor nanocrystals (NanoLEDs) to the  same level of that of organic/polymer light emitting diodes (OLEDs). The key parameters of NanoLEDs targeted for this Phase-II program are 2000 hours operation lifetime, above 200 Cd/m2 brightness, and 0.5-2% \r\nexternal quantum efficiency. The Phase-II program will improve the performance of the NanoLEDs  through  a  unique  design  of  the  nanocrystal  thin  layer  in  the  devices.  This design enables the ligands of all nanocrystals to be inter- and intra-particle cross-linked, which results in the thermally stable nanocrystal thin films required for high performance devices. The three dimensionally  cross-linked ligands are short and have quasi-conjugated electronic structures, instead of the traditional long aliphatic ligands. This choice aims to dramatically improve the charge injection and charge transport in the NanoLEDs. New types of nanocrystals to be used will diminish the re-absorption and energy transfer in the densely packed nanocrystal thin films identified in literature. With the committed support from a state agency and extensive collaboration with mainstream industry  it is expected  to commercialize this technology in the display and lighting industry within five years.  \r\n\r\n The commercial potential of NanoLEDs is enormous. NanoLEDs possess nearly  all of the advantages of OLEDs, but with readily tunable and narrow emission profiles. OLEDs are  currently  being  used in  active  commercial  development.  The  commercial  goal  in  the Phase-II is to boost the performance of the NanoLEDs to at least the same level of that of the polymer LEDs, the low end of OLED devices. The first generation of NanoLEDs will be used in portable electronic devices. When the lifetime of NanoLEDs is extended over ten years, they  will  be  used  for  other  display  technologies  and  in the lighting  industry.  NanoLEDs  will one day  change the way we see the world. Based on industry estimation, the near-term market  for  flexible LEDs, including NanoLEDs, will be $5 billion in 2005. After they are adapted to the mainstream of the flat panel graphics and lighting applications, the market size is going to be at least tens of billions. \r\n\r\n",
