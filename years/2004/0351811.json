 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will determine whether religious and non-religious appeals used by lawyers in closing arguments affect the decision-making of jurors.  Cognitive-experiential self-theory (CEST) predicts that affect caused by religious appeals will lead individuals to process information experientially (i.e. relying on emotions) instead of rationally (i.e. relying on logic).  This study will use CEST to determine whether religious appeals influence processing type and lead to decisions made in legally impermissible ways.  Finally, the project will investigate the effects of directives regarding how to make the sentencing decision.  The experimental methodology employs a written trial summary, edited jury instructions, and a verdict form, all of which are based on an actual trial.  Participants will read the summary and instructions and will indicate their sentencing decisions on the verdict form. Participants will also complete a written task designed to measure type of decision-making strategy used.",
