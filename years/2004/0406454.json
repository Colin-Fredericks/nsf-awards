Parker\r\n\r\nThis project involves analytic aspects of the theory of\r\npseudo-holomorphic curves.  The aim is to develop effective\r\nmethods for computing Gromov-Witten invariants of symplectic\r\nmanifolds and enumerative invariants of algebraic manifolds.  The\r\nmain thrust is a continuing project with E. Ionel on the\r\nGromov-Witten invariants of six-dimensional manifolds. String\r\nTheory is especially effective in making predictions about a\r\nspecial type of six-dimensional spaces called Calabi-Yau 3-folds.\r\nOne of the most fascinating predictions of String Theory is the\r\nGompakumar-Vafa conjecture, which claims that the plethora of\r\nGromov-Witten invariants are determined by a more limited\r\ncollection of `BPS numbers'.  The first proposed project seeks to\r\nderive and prove the Gompakumar-Vafa formulas by adapting the\r\nanalytic methods that C. Taubes developed to relate the\r\nSeiberg-Witten and Gromov invariants.  This approach to the BPS\r\nnumbers is different and more geometric than the physicists'.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work also includes efforts to extend the PI's\r\nprevious work on Relative GW invariants to invariants relative to\r\n``a stratified symplectic subspace'', and to give a geometric and\r\ncomputationally effective description of the virtual fundamental\r\nclass for symplectic manifolds which are not necessary\r\nsemipositive.  A fourth project concerns the ``modified GW\r\ninvariants'' defined by the P.I.'s student Junho Lee; those make\r\nit possible to study a class of manifolds (Kahler surfaces with\r\npositive geometric genus) where there are important conjectures\r\nthat are not currently approachable by GW methods.  The last\r\nproject is geometric analysis of a different sort aimed at\r\nunderstanding how supersymmetry simplifies expressions for heat\r\nkernels on manifolds.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable developments in mathematics in the past\r\ndecade has been the remarkable confluence of ideas coming from\r\nString Theory, Algebraic Geometry, Partial Differential\r\nEquations, and Symplectic Geometry.  A major part of that story\r\nrevolves around the idea of counting holomorphic curves in\r\nalgebraic manifolds.  That problem was studied for 100 years with\r\nfew results.  Then, around 1990, it was realized that the problem\r\ncan be translated into symplectic geometry and tackled using the\r\npowerful machinery of mathematical gauge theory. (Gauge theory,\r\noriginally part of physics, has been the focus of many very\r\nfruitful interactions between mathematicians and physicists over\r\nthe past twenty years; it includes Yang-Mills and Seiberg-Witten\r\nTheory, and String Theory).  This `Gromov-Witten invariant'\r\napproach led quickly to formulas answering some of the original\r\ncurve-counting problems.  The subject is now advancing rapidly on\r\nmany fronts, and is being continually stimulated by the\r\npredictions of physics.  This project is aimed toward further\r\ndeveloping this theory using the gauge theory that is approach\r\nmost closely aligned with physics, and to use the symplectic\r\napproach to make conceptual bridges between the algebraic and\r\nphysics viewpoints.\r\n",
