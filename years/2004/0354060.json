 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF-Europe award to University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is to carry out synthesis and characterization of nanostructured diborides of Zirconium, Titanium and Chromium for super-hard coatings with low friction coefficients and low wear rates.  This collaborative research with Centre d'Etudes Chimie-Metallurgie, CNRS, Vitry Cedex, France will be in the following areas: (1) novel synthesis techniques for nanophase transition metal diboride, in particular by chemical vapor deposition of mixed phase materials; (2) characterization of structure and defects in amorphous and nanocrystalline films through the advanced TEM techniques of fluctuation electron microscopy and the geometric phase image method; and (3) analysis of the friction and wear behavior in terms of driven systems as a theoretical framework. Synthesis and characterization of biborides carried out by this study are likely to produce an improved understanding of how microstructure varies with stoichiometry of  diborides with transition metals, CVD conditions used to prepare them, and wear parameters such as sliding speed and contact load.\r\n\r\nDevelopment of energy efficient tools and devices with hard coatings for wear resistance and low friction will have significant technological and societal benefit. This collaboration with the French scientists will take advantage of the complementary knowledge and experience between the two teams.  Training and teaching of graduate and undergraduate students, and outreach programs including recruitment of women and under-represented groups using existing programs at the University campus are parts of this award.",
