Project Summary\r\nHow do cell-cell interactions regulate cell shapes and movements during development?\r\nOogenesis in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is an excellent model system for answering this\r\nquestion. In the fruit fly ovary, follicle cells surround the oocyte in a single-layer sheet; signaling from\r\nthe oocyte induces a subset of follicle cells to change their shape and position and form two tubes. These\r\ncells secrete eggshell proteins into the tube lumens to produce the dorso-lateral respiratory appendages of\r\nthe eggshell. Interactions between cells coordinate this morphogenetic process.\r\nTwo cell types make each tube: cells expressing the transcription factor Broad form the roof and\r\nsides of each tube, while cells expressing the rhomboid-lacZ reporter gene make the floor (Dorman et al.\r\n2004). Evidence suggests that a \"boundary\" exists between the roof- and floor-forming cells since they 1)\r\nexpress different cell-fate and adhesion markers, 2) exhibit distinct behaviors, 3) never intermingle, and\r\n4) coordinate their movements, even in patterning and morphogenesis mutants (James et al. 2002; James\r\nand Berg 2003; Dorman et al. 2004; Ward and Berg, unpub.). The boundary hypothesis predicts that an\r\norganizing center facilitates communication between the sub-domains of the dorsal-appendage primordia.\r\nUnlike previously described boundaries (reviewed by Irvine and Rauskolb 2001), this proposal\r\nargues that the boundary between the roof- and floor-forming cells is important for morphogenesis and\r\nthat signaling across this border coordinates the movement of these two cell types. Aim one proposes\r\nexperiments to test this hypothesis by examining the behavior of cell clones that are misplaced in the\r\nepithelium. Aim two investigates the signaling center by disrupting candidate molecules that are induced\r\nby the initial patterning processes and that likely coordinate the activity of the roof and floor cells.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The proposed studies will provide insight into events that produce cell shapechanges\r\nand movements within an epithelial tube (e.g., neurulation or kidney development). Boundaries\r\nregulate the growth and patterning of many insect and vertebrate tissues (reviewed by Blair 1995;\r\nDahmann and Basler 1999; Irvine and Rauskolb 2001). This proposal extends the boundary hypothesis to\r\nencompass the regulation of cell shape-changes and movements, thus providing a new paradigm for\r\nexamining disparate morphogenetic processes.\r\nBroader Impact: This proposal addresses fundamental, unsolved aspects of biology: How is cell\r\nfate translated into specific behaviors? How do cells coordinate their activities? How is the fidelity of a\r\nmorphogenetic process maintained to ensure production of functional structures? The proposed studies\r\nevaluate the link between patterning and morphogenesis, provide insight into aberrations that contribute\r\nto birth defects and illuminate related processes, such as tumor growth and metastasis.\r\nThe investigator trains undergraduates and graduate students at a large, diverse state university\r\nand has developed an outreach program to bring minority high-school students into the lab. She has used\r\nthe materials and tools associated with this project to develop a genetics laboratory-course required of all\r\nUW biology majors (670-800 students each year). This project will introduce students to the critical\r\nthinking and scientific methods that are used to understand developmental mechanisms and will expose\r\nthese students to cell biological and genetic approaches in a highly tractable model organism.",
