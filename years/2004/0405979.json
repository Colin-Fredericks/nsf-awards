 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on the geometry of two important classes of\r\ngroups:  mapping class groups of surfaces; and outer automorphism groups\r\nof free groups.  Mapping class groups will be studied using the tools of\r\nlarge scale geometry, with the aim of learning about quasi-isometric\r\nproperties of mapping class groups and proving quasi-isometric rigidity.\r\nAlong the way we expect to develop new tools for understanding\r\nquasi-isometric properties of relatively hyperbolic groups.  Outer\r\nautomorphism groups are not as well understood as mapping class groups,\r\nand will be studied from a more foundational point of view.  The focus\r\nwill be to develop analogies with the theory of Teichmuller spaces which\r\nis a very well developed tool for studying mapping class groups, with the\r\nparticular aim of developing analogies with the ending lamination\r\nconjecture.\r\n\r\nGeometric group theory is the study of symmetry groups associated to\r\nhighly symmetric geometries of infinite extent, such as a crystal lattice\r\nin 3-dimensional space, whose symmetry group is the set of all motions of\r\nspace which move each point of the lattice to another point of the\r\nlattice.  The theory of groups was developed in the 19th century for\r\nstudying symmetry, and it quickly developed into a deep and rich\r\nmathematical tool.  Groups and geometries go hand-in-hand: every group has\r\na corresponding geometry, and one can use tools of geometry to learn about\r\nthe group.  This project will focus on two classes of groups which have\r\nassumed importance in the field of topology.  Given a surface, such as the\r\nsurface of a doughnut with one or more holes, the \"mapping class group\" of\r\nthat surface describes all the ways in which that surface can be mapped\r\nback onto itself.  Similarly, the \"outer automorphism group of a free\r\ngroup\" is a group that describes all of the ways in which a finite\r\n1-dimensional network or graph can be mapped back onto itself.  In both\r\ncases, we will study geometries associated to these groups, with the aim\r\nof learning more about the groups themselves.  In the case of mapping\r\nclass groups our aim is to prove one of the central geometric conjectures,\r\nknown as quasi-isometric rigidity.  In the case of outer automorphism\r\ngroups of free groups, where the geometry is less well understood, we will\r\nattempt to build new tools and make a deeper study of existing tools, in\r\norder to reach a better understanding of the geometry.\r\n\r\n",
