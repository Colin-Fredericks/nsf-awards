 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a model relating the light attenuation and scattering data to the basis weight as well as optical diagnostics for in-process measurement of web uniformity.  Nonwoven polymer fiber webs are used as a primary component in a variety of products including, composite materials, medical textiles, civil engineering fabrics, filters, hygiene products, cosmetics accessories, etc. More than forty automotive parts employ fiber webs. The overall market of these products is estimated to be $100B. Maintaining the uniformity of webs is the quality issue of foremost importance in the manufacturing of nonwoven polymer fiber webs. Recent advancements in the understanding of ensemble scattering by fiber webs are enabling the development of optical diagnostics for the basis-weight uniformity measurements.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impact from this technology will be enhancing the efficiency and productivity of a significant manufacturing sector. From an academic point of view, this project will seek to identify the bulk parameters of a complex system using ensemble measurements and empirical modeling. Dissemination of the results of this work would provide scientists clues to handling the response of other similar complex systems, like multiphase suspensions and emulsions encountered in chemical processing. \r\n",
