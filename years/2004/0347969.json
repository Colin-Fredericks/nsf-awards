 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this research is to develop several unexplored areas in\r\ndata compression, as well as to utilize universal data compression\r\ntechniques in other applications including biological modelling and a\r\nnovel direction of joint source-channel coding. The research focuses on\r\nfour topics: (a) design of joint source-channel universal source code\r\nbased codes, (b) study of universal compression for large and unknown\r\nsource alphabets, (c) design of advanced universal coding techniques for\r\nnon-traditional, yet more realistic, data models with practical\r\nimplementations, and (d) the study of random access lossless compression.\r\n\r\nCommon techniques in joint source-channel coding suffer from\r\nsevere synchronization problems in bad channel conditions and do\r\nnot address universality issues when the source statistics are\r\nunknown.  This research develops techniques to combat these\r\nproblems, and even attain \"free\" gain in channel decoding\r\nperformance for redundant channel information streams. Common\r\ncompression schemes assume that the data is from a known alphabet,\r\nit has a \"standard\" stationary or constantly changing\r\nstatistical model, and it consists of a long sequence. However,\r\n(a) there exist compression applications with large unknown\r\nalphabets, such as text compression where the words constitute the\r\nalphabet, (b) most real data sequences are usually neither stationary\r\nnor of constantly varying statistics, and (c) random access is\r\nnecessary in large compressed data bases. The investigator studies\r\nthese three non-traditional problems. The research work combines\r\nthe development of rigorous theoretical results including\r\nredundancy and description length bounds, with empirical testing,\r\nalgorithm design with focus on practical low-complexity\r\ntechniques, and implementation of proposed techniques. Finally,\r\nthe research also investigates the use of universal compression\r\ntechniques to segmentation and modelling of biological sequences.\r\n\r\n",
