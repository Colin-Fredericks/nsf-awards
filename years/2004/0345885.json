Together with \r\nthe Western Ghats region of southwestern India, Sri Lanka is recognized as one \r\nof the world's biodiversity hotspots - an area with enormous species diversity \r\nand endemism, but also a high degree of threat to natural habitats.  Sri Lanka, \r\nlike much of the developing world, has experienced significant loss of it's once \r\nextensive rainforests.  In fact, only about 5% of the islands rainforest \r\nremains, typically in small isolated fragments.  Thus it was surprising that the \r\nremaining rainforest of Sri Lanka is home to a large number of previously \r\nunknown frog species.  Surveys by the Wildlife Heritage Trust of Sri Lanka over \r\nthe past ten years revealed that there likely are over one hundred species of \r\nsmall terrestrial frogs endemic to the island.  These frogs do not require free \r\nstanding water in which to rear tadpoles - instead, they have no tadpoles and \r\nthe embryos develop completely within eggs laid on land and from which fully \r\nformed froglets emerge.  This mode of reproduction is known as \r\ndirect-development and has evolved only about eight times in frogs making the \r\nSri Lankan species even more unique.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is to fully document the frog species diversity in \r\nSri Lanka as a first step in developing conservation measures to ensure that \r\nthis unique radiation of frogs is not lost to future generations.  We are using \r\na variety of methods to identify and describe the new species and to determine \r\ntheir evolutionary relationships, including: DNA sequences, call recordings, and \r\nanalyses of morphology and ecology.  With funding from NSF we are now able to \r\ncarry out a comprehensive survey of the island's frog fauna and analyze and \r\ndescribe in detail the many species that make up the remarkable radiation of \r\ndirect-developing frogs in Sri Lanka.  In close collaboration with the Wildlife \r\nHeritage Trust of Sri Lanka, we are working to train a new cadre of Sri Lankan \r\nexperts who will form the core of the nation's initiative to catalog and \r\npreserve its natural heritage.  This study not only contributes to basic \r\nunderstanding of amphibian diversity in one of the world's biodiversity \r\nhotspots, but also helps to build the infrastructure to ensure its preservation.\r\n\r\n",
