More recently, however, a new paradigm has emerged in which regulation has driven technology.  A modest regulatory experiment in \"open spectrum\" that began in the ISM bands has spawned an impressive variety of important technologies and innovative uses, from cordless phones and wireless LANs to meter readers and home entertainment products.  Since these systems must adapt to a wide variety of unpredictable conditions, the emerging technologies called \"cognitive radio\" offer significant potential benefits in system capacity and service quality.\r\n\r\nThis investigation begins with the forward-looking assumption that a perfect cognitive radio exists and can configure itself to any transceiver type.  Under this assumption, a number of exemplary cognitive strategies are studied to identify the approaches that offer the greatest benefit at the least \"cost\".  These strategies include: (1) discovery of available spectrum, (2) information to support efficient operation, (3) negotiation in situations of conflict, (4) coding for efficient sharing, and (5) domination in situations of conflict.  Because these strategies are technologically diverse, their costs are measured against the common metrics of hardware and protocol complexity.\r\n\r\nThis work is carried out using a combination of fundamental analysis, computer simulation and physical emulation using testbeds developed at WINLAB.  The results will identify the potential benefits and costs of a diverse set of design strategies, and will be disseminated via a workshop for practitioners in the field.  \r\n\r\n",
