FOSS\r\nINSTITUTION:\t\t\tMICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY\r\n\r\n\r\nVORTICITY-BASED CHARACTERIZATION OF A HIGH REYNOLDS NUMBER SINGLE-STREAM SHEAR LAYER\r\n\r\nThis grant will support research that will contribute to understanding turbulent flow physics by providing experimental data, and the insights derived from these data, that will characterize the intermittent regions (high and low speed sides) of a single-stream shear layer (self-preserving region).  The shear layer is one of the basic building block canonical turbulent flows that is present in many engineering applications.  These data, in addition too providing insight into the physics of turbulence in their own right, are expected to be of value in the development of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) computational tools.  Specifically, the detailed stochastic information to be provided will provide a valuable reference condition for such computations.  As an added feature, the array of four-sensor vorticity probes will directly provide the spatially-filtered data appropriate for an LES computation.  In addition, the vorticity-based intermittency designations will provide a definition for this fundamental measure of the turbulent motions.  The availability of these accurate and time-resolved data will support LES computations, which in turn, promise advances for more successful computations of the turbulent flows that are ubiquitous in practical engineering problems.  Derivative benefits include:  improved combustion efficiencies, better mixing processes and insight into acoustic emissions.  Broader impacts include technological elements, e.g. engineering computations, as well as educational ones.  A direct benefit is to support a laboratory that strongly encourages opportunities for diverse students, and research involvements for college age participants.  The involvement of high school students (MSU-High School Honors Science Program) is a further direct benefit.  The PI's long-term commitment, to providing student research experience will be strengthened by the opportunities associated with this grant. \r\n",
