 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this proposal are to develop new and widely applicable\r\nsemiparametric and nonparametric approaches to solve challenging\r\nstatistical problems from computational biology. Frontiers of biological\r\nresearch such as normalization and analysis of microarray and proteomic\r\ndata, functional connectivity of brains, covariate effects on longitudinal\r\nand functional data, and prediction of individual response trajectories\r\nhave generated a number of outstanding statistical challenges.  Several\r\nnew semiparametric and nonparametric models have been introduced to\r\naddress the imminent needs for the aforementioned biological applications.  \r\nA number of innovative methods on nonparametric estimation and inferences\r\nare proposed. Their properties will be investigated via both asymptotic\r\ntheory and simulations.  Their efficacy in biological applications will be\r\ncarefully scrutinized.  This proposal not only introduces a number of\r\ninnovative techniques and useful statistical models, but also provides\r\nvarious new insights into nonparametric inferences.  The research findings\r\nwill have significant impact on the future development of statistical\r\ntheories and methodologies.\r\n\r\nTechnological invention and information advancement have revolutionized\r\nscientific research and technological development. Quantitative methods\r\nhave been widely employed in scientific communities.  They have played\r\npivotal roles in knowledge discovery.  This proposal intends to develop\r\nnew nonparametric techniques and theories that arise from frontiers of\r\nscientific development. In particular, the investigators will develop\r\nmodels and cutting-edge technologies for the analysis of microarray,\r\nproteomic, longitudinal and functional data and fMRI brain images. Common\r\ncharacteristics of these data are their complexity and size, where\r\nnonparametric techniques are particularly powerful and under developed.\r\nThe proposed techniques address imminent needs in computational aspects of\r\nmolecular biology, neurology, and epidemiology. In addition, they will\r\nintegrate new mathematical developments with those in science and\r\nengineering, which empowers new knowledge discoveries and prudent policy\r\nmaking.  Undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctors and\r\nunderrepresented groups will be trained as results of this research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
