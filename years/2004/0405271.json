Kronheimer\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to apply gauge-theory techniques to\r\nthe study of three-dimensional manifolds.  The principal\r\ninvestigator proposes to investigate Floer homology and closely\r\nrelated areas of geometry, and hopes to shed light on the\r\napplicability of gauge theory to problems in three-dimensional\r\ntopology and geometry.  Potential applications of gauge theory\r\ninclude a proof of the \"Property P conjecture\", which states that\r\na non-trivial surgery on a non-trivial knot cannot yield a\r\nsimply-connected 3-manifold.  There are expected to be other\r\napplications of Floer homology to questions about surgery on\r\nknots. As part of this program, the principal investigator will\r\ncomplete a thorough investigation of the foundations of\r\nSeiberg-Witten Floer homology. A similar study of the\r\nclosely-related instanton Floer homology is at present obstructed\r\nby difficulties stemming from the non-compactness of instanton\r\nmoduli spaces. The principal investigator intends to examine\r\nthese obstructions with a view towards having a more complete\r\ninstanton Floer theory.\r\n\r\nTopology is the qualitative study of space and its connectedness.\r\nIts importance was recognized at the turn of the last century by\r\nthe French mathematician Poincare, during his investigation of\r\nthe laws of motion that govern the movement of a three-body\r\nsystem such as the Earth, Moon and Sun moving according to\r\nNewton's laws.  In the past twenty years, topology has seen\r\napplications in questions such as the knotting of proteins and\r\nDNA, and in modern theories of high-energy physics.  The topology\r\nof three-dimensional spaces, as opposed to those of higher\r\ndimension, is of particular subtlety.  Through this project, it\r\nis hoped to bring new techniques to bear on outstanding questions\r\nin three-dimensional topology.  These techniques -- gauge theory\r\nand the Seiberg-Witten equations -- originated in physics, where\r\nthey had potential application to fundamental questions such as\r\nquark confinement.  They have been an effective tool in the study\r\nof four-dimensional spaces (such as our space-time).  The aim now\r\nis to apply the same techniques to questions in dimension three.\r\n",
