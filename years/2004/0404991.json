 "awd_abstract_narration": "The idea of genericity in geometric group theory was introduced by\r\nGromov and Ol'shanskii and is now the subject of very active research.\r\nGenericity exhibits itself on many different levels in algebraic,\r\ngeometric and algorithmic properties of ``random'' algebraic objects\r\nand in the generic-case behavior of their natural geometric invariants\r\nand decision problems.  As already demonstrated by the proposers'\r\nwork, a generic approach often leads to the discovery of objects with\r\ngenuinely new and interesting properties. For example, genericity\r\nprovides a totally new source of group-theoretic rigidity,\r\nquite different from the standard source provided by lattices in\r\nsemi-simple Lie groups.\r\nMuch of the prior research on probabilistic aspects of infinite groups \r\nhas concentrated on mostly analytic questions, such as amenability, \r\nasymptotic properties of random walks, Poisson boundary, and so on.\r\n This project will focus on understanding the algebraic and algorithmic \r\nproperties of random group-theoretic objects as well as probabilistic \r\nproperties of various traditionally studied geometric invariants of \r\ngroups. Specific topics, where  the proposers have already made substantial \r\ninroads, will include:  the isomorphism rigidity of generic groups, analysis \r\nof ``random'' van Kampen diagrams and generic Dehn functions, generic subgroup \r\ndistortion and generic stretching factors of automorphisms, and the action of \r\nthe outer automorphism group of a free group on the ``frequency space'' of a \r\nfree group.\r\n\r\nWith the rapid development of modern computers, understanding the practical \r\nbehavior of the performance of various algorithms is becoming increasingly \r\nimportant. Yet most of theoretical research thus far deals with the worst-case \r\nanalysis of algorithms, which often has little to do with their practical performance. \r\nOn the other hand, in many real-life applications, in particular, to public key \r\ncryptography, there is a great deal of experimental data on the practical performance \r\nof algorithms that has not been adequately explained theoretically. The current project \r\nshould provide a number of new benchmark ideas and theoretical tools for studying and \r\nexplaining probabilistic properties and practical behavior of algorithms both in group \r\ntheory and in the broad field of computational complexity.\r\n\r\n",
