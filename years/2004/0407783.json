 "awd_abstract_narration": "Maui  Community  College  (MCC)  will  use  this  NSF  Tribal  College  Undergraduate  Program  (TCUP)  proposal  to implement  an  institution-wide  effort  to  restructure  and  strengthen  introductory  mathematics  and  science  courses.  \r\nMCC will increase significantly the number of students entering, persisting, and succeeding at high levels in science, mathematics and STEM degree programs, with particular focus on Hawaiian students. The name and .spirit. of this project,  Ho.okahua--  .to  lay  a  foundation.--  wil  strengthen  science  and  mathematics  learning  and  establish  the foundation  upon  which  STEM  students  can succeed.  The Ho.okahua  project  is based on  research  indicating  that schools that establish high expectations for all students.and give them the necessary support to achieve them have high rates of academic success (Benard, 1995).   \r\n \r\nThis  project  employs  a  variety  of  strategies  including  .bridge.  programs  for  high  school  students,  STEM  faculty development  in  interactive  teaching  strategies  and  problem-based  learning  techniques,  mathematics  and  science course/curriculum improvements, and new and enhanced student support systems and organizations.  \r\n \r\nMCC will implement three major improvement components through the Ho.okahua TCUP Project: \r\n \r\n(1)   Provide faculty development and curriculum development opportunities to restructure and strengthen \r\nscience and mathematics offerings  by  adapting  and  infusing  the  Interactive  Mathematics  Program  (IMP) \r\nmodel into MCC.s curriculum and by strengthening content in introductory science courses, including integrating indigenous knowledge into the courses/curriculum. \r\n(2)   Increase incoming student  preparedness for STEM courses and programs  through  a  series  of  .bridge. \r\nprograms, increased faculty involvement in these programs, better alignment between the high school curriculum and  the  introductory  science  and  mathematics  curriculum  at  MCC,  enhanced  student  outreach,  and  greater visibility for students succeeding in STEM careers. \r\n(3)  Increase student success in STEM courses and programs by establishing Student Cohort Groups, a STEM \r\nStudent  Development/Counseling  Office,  and  a  STEM  Computer-Assisted  Study  Center  through  which  the project staff will mentor and tutor STEM students. \r\n",
