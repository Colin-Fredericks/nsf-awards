 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major goals of this collaborative project are two-fold: (1) To \r\nobtain high resolution images of inner core anisotropy, through a \r\nproposed PASSCAL experiment; (2) To develop a geodynamic model for \r\nthe origin of the observed seismic anisotropy.  The investigators \r\nplan to deploy two linear arrays of 15 new stations in the interior \r\nof Alaska, coded as Alaska Receiving Cross-Transects for the Inner \r\nCore (ARCTIC). New data from earthquakes in South Sandwich Islands to \r\nthe arrays will provide critically needed lateral and depth samples \r\nof the inner core for determining the inner core rotation and for \r\nresolving the structure of the inner core transition zone and the \r\ndepth-dependence of inner core anisotropy and attenuation. the team \r\nplans to develop a geodynamic model for the formation of anisotropy, \r\nusing the new and existing data as a constraint. The major objective \r\nof the modeling is to identify and investigate physical processes, \r\nincluding effects of plastic deformation, inner-core growth and \r\nrecrystallization, and anisotropy in the thermal conductivity, that \r\ncan account for the observed depth and lateral variations in \r\nanisotropy. The developed model will serve as a physical context for \r\ninterpreting the seismic observations. Predictions of the model will \r\nbe used to calculate synthetic waveforms, which are subsequently \r\ncompared with the observations to refine the model. The new data \r\ncollected will also be used to elucidate crustal and upper mantle \r\nstructure of the Alaska interior.  The north-south line from \r\nFairbanks to Prudhoe Bay will cross the Brooks Range in northern \r\nAlaska, and The east-west line between Fairbanks and Nome will cover \r\nparts of western Alaska in a known, but nearly unstudied, region of \r\nextensional tectonics.\r\n",
