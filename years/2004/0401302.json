 "awd_abstract_narration": "Huang and Lepowsky intend to solve a range of problems related to\r\nvertex (operator) algebra theory and conformal field theory, and their\r\nrelations with and applications to a variety of areas of mathematics\r\nand physics.  They intend to use new and evolving algebraic, geometric\r\nand analytic ideas and methods.  Huang proposes to continue to develop\r\nan algebraic, analytic and geometric theory underlying conformal field\r\ntheory and to apply the results obtained to the solution of problems\r\nin algebra, geometry and topology.  Lepowsky intends to continue to\r\ndevelop vertex operator algebra theory and its relations with\r\nconformal field theory, infinite-dimensional algebraic structures,\r\nnumber theory and the theory of combinatorial identities.  Huang and\r\nLepowsky also propose to solve problems related to the remarkable\r\ncircle of ideas called ``monstrous moonshine,'' to geometric\r\nuniformizations and to logarithmic tensor product theory.  The varied\r\ntopics discussed in this proposal are in fact deeply connected with\r\none another, and the solutions of certain of these problems are\r\nexpected to be useful in the analysis and solution of others.  A\r\nlong-term goal of Huang and Lepowsky is to contribute to the deeper\r\ndevelopment of a mathematical theory that will enhance the conceptual\r\nunderstanding of many known and still-unknown connections among many\r\nbranches of mathematics and theoretical physics.  Huang and Lepowsky\r\nwill continue to be very active in their teaching, writing, organizing\r\nof conferences and seminars, and their other activities designed to\r\nincrease and enhance the understanding in the mathematical community\r\nof the very rich field in which they work.  They will also continue to\r\ntry to convey to members of the theoretical physics community, through\r\nwriting and their speaking, their enthusiasm for the richness and\r\nutility of their approach to vertex operator algebra theory and\r\nmathematical conformal field theory.\r\n\r\nThe theory of vertex operator algebras arose naturally in the study of\r\ncertain infinite-dimensional symmetries and in the solution of\r\nfundamental problems relating the ``Monster,'' a certain finite\r\nsymmetry group, with number theory, and this theory is fundamental to\r\na wide range of problems in both mathematics and theoretical physics.\r\nVertex operator algebras are crucial ingredients in the mathematical\r\nstudy of conformal field theory, a physical theory that arose in both\r\ncondensed matter physics and string theory, which in turn is a\r\nphysical theory attempting to unify all the interactions in the\r\nuniverse.  Conformal field theory is in the process of being rapidly\r\ndeveloped into a rich and beautiful mathematical theory.  This\r\ndevelopment has already led to new ideas, surprising results and the\r\nsolutions of many mathematical problems, and it is expected to lead to\r\nmany more.  The mathematical development of conformal field theory has\r\nalso been applied to the study of physical phenomena such as disorder\r\nsytems, condensed matter physics on surfaces with boundaries and\r\ncertain higher-dimensional physical objects called D-branes in string\r\ntheory.\r\n",
