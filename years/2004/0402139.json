 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bio-Link -- the ATE Center for Biotechnology - is transitioning to an ATE National Resource Center.  This project focuses on (1) refining Bio-Link's best national practices and (2) implementing a new approach to regional and local work that builds upon Bio-Link's strengths.  Together, these practices consolidate and expand Bio-Link's position as a national resource for advancing the education of biotechnology technicians at community and technical colleges nationwide. Bio-Link's National Center, hosted by City College of San Francisco (CCSF), provides leadership to a network of Regional Centers using a coordinated national strategy with local implementation.  The Regional Centers reside at two-year colleges nationwide: Northeast (New Hampshire Community Technical College); Southeast (Alamance Community College); North Central (Madison Area Technical College); South Central (Austin Community College); Northwest (Shoreline Community College); Northern California (CCSF); and Southwest.   \r\n\r\nBio-Link's mission is to strengthen and expand biotechnology technician education at two-year colleges throughout the nation in order to (1) increase the number and diversity of well-trained technicians in the workforce; (2) meet the needs of industry for appropriately trained technicians; and (3) institutionalize community college educational practices that make modern, high-quality education in the concepts, skills, and ethics of biotechnology available to all students.  Bio-Link supports its mission through: (1) providing support for students and technicians; (2) improving instruction and learning; (3) sharing information and resources; and (4) fostering collaborations and partnerships.  \r\n\r\nBio-Link is continuing several national practices: the Web Site (with appropriate refinements and continual updating); the online Curriculum and Instructional Materials Clearinghouse; and the National Longitudinal Program Survey and online directory.  It is beginning three new endeavors: development of a national equipment registry, creation of a student and faculty internship program, and pursuit of cross-disciplinary partnerships with other ATE Centers and projects.  Bio-Link's new approach is both regional and local in nature.  The Regional Centers provide services and products that build on Bio-Link's proven strengths but that are most effective when tailored to local needs: professional development workshops; pedagogical training and use of industry instructors; short courses; curriculum development; and articulation assistance. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project resides in its focus on biotechnology, a multidisciplinary industry that warrants significant attention in today's climate, one in which threats against homeland security and health loom large and in which medicine evolves with great speed.  Moreover, the industry provides technicians with opportunities to advance rapidly into high-wage positions.  With respect to broader impacts, Bio-Link, has influenced science education in general through materials and techniques developed within its network.  With its partners, it has piqued industry's interest in hiring community college graduates, and has opened doors for underrepresented populations.  Bio-Link is expanding its broad dissemination of cutting-edge resources to improve teaching practice and educational access. \r\n",
