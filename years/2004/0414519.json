Controlling friction and wear can either inhibit or enable technological advances from large engines to body prostheses, MEMS and nanotechnological devices. Thus, in the 21st Century, tribology will continue to critically impact all aspects of our quality of life, health, wealth and livelihood and there are significant challenges to be addressed, many requiring paradigm shifts in both our approaches and thinking. The biennial Gordon Research Conference in tribology is the premiere basic research meeting for tribologists and supporting scientists. Coming from all parts of the world, leading scientists from universities, national labs and industries gather with young scientists and newcomers to tribology for one week of formal and informal discussions on state-of-the art issues in this multidisciplinary and multi-scale subject. Today's Problems & Tomorrow's Solutions - Challenging Our Needs in Tribology Research theme is our attempt to explore how underlying science, including recent advances in our understanding of surface mechanics, physics, chemistry and phase transformations can help solve the problems posed by tomorrow's applications. Simultaneously we wish to examine the converse problem: how the perceived demands of tomorrow's innovative devices and applications can reveal 'the blanks' in our current understandings and research capabilities. The speakers and discussion leaders chosen for the 2004 GRC Conference on Tribology are amongst the most eminent scholars and researchers in the world. Besides bringing many of the established intellectual leaders of the subject together to brainstorm the future, there is also a very strong commitment to fully involve practicing engineers and young scientists from a range of related disciplines so that they may not only learn of the latest research tools but also contribute to the paradigm changes in approach which are necessary for underpinning and enabling the future.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit. This meeting is a key mechanism for linking basic science with a technological field of significant importance to the U.S. and World economies. It also provides ties between new, young investigators and those with experience and depth in their understanding of the problems. Advances in tribology also require a constant flux of new ideas and healthy connections to other disciplines. This meeting provides an extremely efficient way to make all of these connections.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts. This proposal focuses on providing support for conference fees and/or travel expenses for participants including discussion leaders, speakers, graduate students, postdocs and young investigators. This will allow many young investigators the opportunity to benefit from the new working experience which the Gordon Conferences provide but who could not otherwise be able to attend because of fund restrictions. We strive for gender balance and also favor any under-represented ethnic minority or disabled individuals that apply. Beyond these criteria, we will attempt to diversify the meeting by selecting attendees from academic research, industry, and educational professions with a further eye toward a mix of senior and junior independent investigators, postdoctoral trainees and graduate students. We are also seeking funds to support a few undergraduates (seniors) who have expressed interest in attending and wish to present posters.\r\n",
