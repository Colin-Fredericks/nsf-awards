 "awd_abstract_narration": "In its broader outlines, this research program aims at the development,\r\nanalysis and computer implementation of numerical methods designed to\r\napproximate the solutions of some partial differential equations that have\r\nimportant applications in the fields of engineering and physics. Indeed,\r\nelliptic equations, the Navier-Stokes equations and nonlinear wave\r\nequations despite having been cultivated for decades, still offer fertile\r\nground for further exploration, for there are still a plethora of\r\nunanswered questions and a pressing need for more efficient and faster\r\nalgorithms. The discontinuous Galerkin method will constitute the core methodology of\r\nthis effort. While going back to 1973, major interest did not focus on it\r\nuntil the nineties. Today it constitutes one of the most active areas\r\nwithin finite elements if not the whole range of methods for the numerical\r\ntreatment of partial differential equations. It has not been as\r\nextensively explored as the standard Galerkin version, yet what is known\r\nso far offers a tantalizing glimpse of its potential. The project will\r\ninvolve various areas at the cutting edge of numerical analysis and\r\nscientific computing, in particular, the development of convergent and\r\nefficient adaptive methods designed to reduce the run time of the\r\nalgorithms by finding optimal or quasi-optimal meshes. These adaptive\r\nmethods will require continuing the work on the development of sharp\r\na-posteriori error estimators designed to identify regions where the\r\nsolution is varying rapidly. Major efforts will be directed towards\r\npursuing a recently identified strategy for reducing the number of\r\niterations that current adaptive algorithms require in achieving a\r\nprescribed level of accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific computing is recognized as crucial to the advancement of\r\nscience. As such, the development of state of the art algorithms and codes\r\nis important for the progress of technology. Specifically, improved\r\nadaptive codes resulting from this project will have impact on a wide\r\nrange of problems and applications involving fluid flow phenomena, the\r\nelucidation of extremely fast chemical reactions by femtosecond lasers,\r\nand numerical simulations of supernova explosions. \r\n",
