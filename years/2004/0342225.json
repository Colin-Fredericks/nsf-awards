 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. is vulnerable to a wide variety of natural, technological and\r\nhuman-induced hazards.  While local decision-makers have the final\r\nresponsibility for coping with the threat of disaster, federal agencies have\r\ndeveloped science-based activities, such as the National Earthquake Hazards\r\nReduction Program (NEHRP), that are intended to help further effective\r\ndisaster reduction efforts in at-risk communities throughout the nation.  The\r\nNational Science Foundation (NSF) has been a major supporter of social\r\nscience disaster research, including such research carried out as part of the\r\nNEHRP effort.  The objective of this study is to provide NSF with a detailed\r\nappraisal of the short and long-term challenges facing the social science\r\ndisaster research community and new and emerging opportunities for advancing\r\nknowledge in the field and its application for the benefit of society.  The\r\nstudy is intended to provide a basis for planning future social science and\r\nmultidisciplinary research related to natural, technological and willful\r\ndisasters in response to challenges and opportunities presented by a changing\r\nnation and world.  A committee of distinguished experts in the field will be\r\nestablished to carry out the study.           \r\n\r\n\r\n",
