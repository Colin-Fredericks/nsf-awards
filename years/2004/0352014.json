 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-scale power outages occurred on August 14, 2003 covering a 10,000 square-mile\r\narea involving 50 million people in more than 10 states in Midwest and northeastern part of this\r\nnation and southern Canada. A number of major centers of population such as Metropolitan\r\nNew York were impacted severely causing human inconvenience and miseries of all kind while\r\npower recovery effort gradually took effect. The disaster may have been caused by, as many\r\nsuspected, malfunction of a critical power component under excessive power demand in the\r\nsummer heat. It might take some time, however, to identify the exact cause of this worst power\r\nblackout in the history of USA.\r\nThe objective of this exploratory research is to acquire and archive potentially perishable\r\ndata related to the outages. We are particularly interested in the way in which the outage initiated\r\nand cascaded throughout the power grids. The data to be collected will span a spectrum of\r\nmechanical, electrical and socio-economic impact with significant emphasis on the data that are\r\nneeded for grid reliability evaluation.\r\nPI of this proposed research studied extensively on reliability of utility networks and\r\npower grids to resist seismic conditions under which similar outages could happen. In these\r\nstudies, transmission networks and grids, involving Los Angels Department of Water and\r\nPower.s (LADWP.s) and Memphis Light, Gas, and Water.s (MLGWP.s) systems were used as\r\nliving laboratories. These studies were based upon the analytical simulation of power flow, using\r\nElectric Power Research Institute.s Interactive Power Flow (IPFlow) code, which is the industry\r\nstandard, for realistic performance evaluation of Western Electric Coordinating Council.s\r\n(WECC.s) power grid and of Memphis transmission network.\r\nInitially, the study was motivated by an accident in August 1996 in Oregon, in which a\r\ntree came into contact with a segment of a high-voltage aerial power line, disabling its\r\ntransmission capability. The result was a wide-spread blackout in several states and cities,\r\nincluding part of Los Angeles. In fact, the research demonstrated that a local disturbance and\r\ninstability can propagate almost instantly far away to remote locations. The research became\r\nmore seriously significant after the tragic September 11 event from homeland security point of\r\nview and has just added another layer of relevance since the August 14, 2003 power outage.\r\nThis is because disablement can be man-made, accidental or malicious, and cause a devastatingly\r\nnegative impact on socio-economic welfare of the directly affected regions immediately and of\r\nthe nation in the long run.\r\nPI.s experience and expertise plays a crucial role in identifying the data that are\r\nindispensable and therefore should be collected for the ensuing reliability analysis of the physical\r\ncomponents, utility networks and power grids. Since the preparedness for the emergency of the\r\nutility organizations, individually and in collaboration, is critical in minimizing the consequence\r\nof outages, the data will include the record of implemented organizational response processes.\r\nBeyond these, data are needed to record how transportation, water and other lifeline systems and\r\nbusiness/industrial sectors behaved under the interruption of power supply. The estimated\r\neconomic losses will be updated as more information emerges, although the estimation will be\r\nsomewhat speculative within the first year after the event.\r\nBroader Impact of this research is that it will contribute to significant scientific advances\r\nin predictive systems analysis methods and protective countermeasures, and it will benefit tens of\r\nmillions of customers of the utility systems, and local, regional and national economy.\r\nPedagogically the research project is truly beneficial in training and encouraging junior\r\nresearchers to become more interested in the electric power related research where lack of\r\nresearch talents has been conspicuous.",
