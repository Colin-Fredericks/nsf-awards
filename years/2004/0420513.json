 "awd_abstract_narration": "A grant has been awarded to the University of New Mexico under the direction of Dr. Hua Guo for partial support of the acquisition of a high performance shared-memory computer for computational science and engineering at the University of New Mexico (UNM). This grant will be used to purchase and maintain a state-of-the-art supercomputer to meet the research and educational needs at UNM. The new equipment will be housed at UNM's High Performance Computing Center, accessible by all faculty and students on campus. This equipment will greatly enhance the computational capabilities of multiple research groups-enabling them to tackle new and more challenging problems, particularly in bio-related areas.  It will also substantially improve graduate and undergraduate training in the area of high performance computing by providing new research opportunities for students.\r\n\r\nAt the University of New Mexico, there exists a diverse group of investigators engaged in computationally intensive advanced research projects in physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science. In addition to these traditional domains of research, there is a growing trend towards interdisciplinary collaborations to address complex problems in systems biology and nanotechnology. The research described in this proposal includes biologically-motivated research projects that span conventional departmental boundaries such as computational biophysics and biochemistry, phylogenetics, and virtual drug screening, as well as work in materials science and the quantum control of complex systems. In addition, education programs in high performance computing will be closely integrated with research in several areas to take advantage of the equipment.  The acquisition of this instrument will have a broad and positive impact on the research and education programs at this minority-serving University. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
