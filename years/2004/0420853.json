 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop an ultra high vacuum materials deposition and characterization system. The system will provide combined deposition and analysis capabilities not currently available at TTU, significantly enhancing our materials research and educational efforts. Development of these capabilities will have an immediate impact on numerous projects funded by NSF.\r\nIntellectual Merit: The system will be used to conduct basic and applied research in thin film deposition and surface analysis. In large bandgap materials, our recent work has demonstrated ultraviolet LEDs operating at wavelength 262 nm. New questions regard the influence of surface chemistry and metallization on contact formation. The development of microelectronic materials with high dielectric constant leads to questions on the importance of silicon gate-dielectric interface. Our nano-engineered energetic materials rely on interdiffusion reactions. To optimize structures for energy storage and release, improvements are needed in control over deposition and in situ characterization to study the reactions. MOEMS research involves micromirror development and basic studies of wear. Surface characterization will advance our efforts in stiction and friction remediation and extend our MOEMS research into of fatigue and failure. Broader Impact: This instrumentation impacts numerous ongoing research projects and enhances our interactions with industry and national laboratories. The scope of our studies is broad, and spans numerous areas in science and engineering. The TTU Nano Tech Center provides an interdisciplinary setting with excellent technical, team, and leadership building opportunities for postdoctoral researchers and students at all levels through research and courses conducted within Center facilities.\r\n",
