 "awd_abstract_narration": "0409756\r\nSturchio\r\n\r\nThe age of groundwater is one of the most elusive geologic parameters to quantify, despite its\r\ncrucial significance for water resources, waste management, subsurface reactive transport, and\r\npaleoclimate studies. It has long been recognized that 81 Kr is a nearly ideal tracer for\r\ndetermining residence times of old groundwater in the 5 10 4 10 6 year range, yet because of its\r\nlow abundance ( 81 Kr/Kr 10 -12 ) it has been nearly impossible to measure. However, a new\r\ntechnique for measurement of 81 Kr/Kr ratios in small quantities of Kr (as little as 50 micromoles)\r\nwas recently reported (Atom-Trap Trace Analysis, or ATTA; Chen et al., 1999; Du et al., 2003),\r\nand its application to old groundwater was demonstrated successfully by the PI and colleagues in\r\ntheir NSF-funded study of the Nubian Aquifer, Egypt (Sturchio et al., 2003). That study\r\nestablished the feasibility of using the ATTA technique for routine 81 Kr/Kr measurement in\r\nhydrologic investigations of systems having long groundwater residence times. The ATTA\r\ntechnique, which can also be used for measuring 85 Kr/Kr, is thus an ideal tool with which to\r\naddress a range of fundamental questions in hydrology.\r\nThis proposal requests support for a graduate student to work with the PI and colleagues\r\n(Z. T. Lu's group at Argonne National Laboratory) in developing further applications of the trace\r\nKr isotopes ( 81 Kr and 85 Kr) in hydrologic investigations. The intellectal merit of this research is\r\nthat it will lead to an enhanced understanding of the water cycle within the Earth's crust.\r\nSpecific investigations that we propose are: (1) to determine the residence time of saline\r\ngroundwaters in the central U.S.A., which on the basis of stable isotope data are believed to have\r\ntraveled more than 1,000 km from a recharge area in the Rocky Mountains (Musgrove and\r\nBanner, 1993), and which should therefore have a residence time on the order of 10 6 years; (2) to\r\nconstrain the residence time of hydrothermal waters at Yellowstone National Park, for which\r\nlittle information is available (Pearson and Truesdell, 1978); (3) to determine the residence time\r\nof groundwater in the Milk River aquifer of southern Alberta, which was the subject of an earlier\r\nmulti-tracer study sponsored by the IAEA that was focused on dating very old groundwater\r\n(Ivanovich, Frohlich, and Hendry, 1991); and to investigate residence times of young (<50 yr)\r\ngroundwaters where other tracers such as tritium-helium and CFC's do not provide coherent\r\nresults. These investigations are representative of the broad range of potential applications of\r\ntrace Kr isotopes in groundwater hydrology.\r\nThe broader impact of the proposed research is that it will provide opportunities for\r\nresearch, training, and education at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), which has the\r\nnation's fifth most diverse student population; it will establish enhanced local Chicago-area\r\npartnership for routine application of trace Kr isotopes in hydrology, because the Kr separations\r\nwill henceforth be performed in a laboratory at UIC (rather than in Switzerland as in the previous\r\nNSF-funded study) with ATTA measurements performed nearby at Argonne National\r\nLaboratory; it will help establish the new subdiscipline of Kr isotope hydrology, which may have\r\nsignificant impact on hydrologic investigations and water resources management worldwide.",
