 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computational Methods in Financial Engineering\r\nMark Broadie, Paul Glasserman and Steve Kou\r\n\r\nThis project addresses computational problems in financial engineering.\r\nFinancial engineering deals broadly with the use of mathematical and \r\ncomputational tools to model the dynamics of asset prices, to value and \r\nhedge derivative securities tied to those assets, and to measure and \r\ncontrol the risks associated with these instruments.  This project will \r\naddress three specific areas requiring innovative computational tools and analysis:  \r\n(1) high-dimensional stochastic dynamic programming problems embedded \r\nin the valuation of American options;\r\n(2) numerical methods for jump-diffusion models based on transform analysis\r\nand asymptotics; (3) calculation of price sensitivities and related hedge \r\nparameters and risk measures using Monte Carlo methods.\r\n\r\nThe emerging field of financial engineering draws on mathematics, statistics,\r\neconomics, and numerical methods to solve modeling and computational problems\r\narising in the financial industry.  The US is currently a world leader in\r\nthis field, which is a source of competitive advantage in financial services.\r\nThis field is also a large and growing source of employment\r\nfor highly skilled individuals in the mathematical sciences.\r\nThis project is part of a larger network of research and teaching\r\nactivities through which the Principal Investigators interact with\r\nresearchers in industry and other universities to help shape and advance \r\nthe field of financial engineering. Financial engineering at Columbia spans \r\nseveral departments; this project will facilitate interdepartmental \r\ncollaboration and help sustain a community of students and faculty from \r\ndifferent disciplines with shared interests.\r\n",
