 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chabot Space and Science Center seeks support to engage in a six-month planning process for \"Imagine That!,\" a multi-faceted science and technology career exploration program.  In partnership with the Columbia River Exhibition of History, Science & Technology (CREHST) and the American Museum of Science & Energy (AMSE), Chabot proposes to fill the gap between well-intentioned and designed programs and the programs' abilities to really influence/affect future career choices by participants. \"Imagine That!\" will familiarize youth with a wide range of careers in scientific and technical fields through after-school and summer programs that offer in-depth career exploration and guidance activities, hands-on experiences that complement science education in school and an introduction to role models.  \"Imagine That!\" will also provide parents with resources to support their children as they explore potential careers in science, technology and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis planning grant will enable the three major science museums, Junior Achievement and government and business partners to develop the logistics for working together on an ambitious collaborative program of national scope.  \"Imagine That!\" has the potential for broad and significant impact.  Not only would it create a national program of career exploration, it will strengthen and diversify the STEM workforce.  The national impact of this project is assured by the inclusion of geographically diverse partners, regional advisory councils and a robust dissemination plan.\r\n",
