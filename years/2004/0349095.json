The first part of the study involves the central supermassive black holes that reside in galaxies.  The goal of the research is to investigate the existence of black holes in globular clusters and to study the properties of massive galaxies with the largest known black holes.  The purpose of the work is to allow for stringent tests of evolutionary models that predict correlations between black holes and the properties of their host galaxies, and also to better ascertain how black holes grow.  The second effort involves an investigation of galaxy dark matter halos.  The goal is to analyze dark matter profiles, to provide both the shape and the stellar orbital properties throughout a given galaxy. These profiles should provide direct insight into the initial formation of the galaxy, since different formation processes leave different relic signatures.\r\n\r\nBroader impact of this research will result from outreach to allow the public to see the results immediately and directly. The goal is to use a website to disseminate the information.  Black hole studies in particular fascinate the public, and the outreach effort will take advantage of that interest in order to \"educate and excite\".\r\n\r\n",
