 "awd_abstract_narration": "Trophy hunting of adult male cougars is widely believed to be beneficial. This \"surplus male\" or \"food competition\" hypothesis predicts that mortality of older males results in increased food for females, increased production and survival of young, sustained female population growth, and decreased predation on prey - because of reduced numbers of male predators. By contrast, the \"sex competition\" hypothesis predicts that trophy hunting results in reduced food for females because of avoidance of new immigrant males in prey-rich areas; fewer young because of poor food or infanticide; decreased female population growth; and increased predation - because of increased numbers of infanticidal, immigrant males.  Cougars will be captured, radio-collared, and monitored in 4 \"crossover\" (hunted becomes unhunted & vice versa) study areas to test these predictions.\r\n\r\nIf the sex competition hypothesis is correct it could have important implications for population regulation theory, wildlife management, and conservation biology. For example: hunting of adult males could be causing 1) increased attacks on declining mule deer, domestic animals and humans beings via an increased number of immigrant males; and 2) a long-term decline in cougar population viability via reduced female population growth. This project will integrate scientific research, learning, and ecologically sustainable community development through Project CAT - a joint research and K-12 education and outreach program sponsored by the Cle-Elum Rosyln School District and the Washington Dept. of Fish and Wildlife.     \r\n",
