The remainder of the project is subdivided into\r\nthree major subprojects.  The first subproject is to provide a complete\r\nset of recognition theorems for the alternating groups of degree at least\r\nnine and for the finite groups of Lie type of untwisted Lie rank at least\r\nthree. These recognition theorems will mesh with the local structure\r\nobtained in other volumes, generally a bouquet of known quasisimple groups\r\nof Lie or alternating type, arising as components in the centralizers of\r\ncommuting elements of prime order.  This project involves collaboration\r\nwith finite geometers, including Shpectorov, Gramlich and Hoffman. The\r\nsecond project is to provide an analysis of two special classes of finite\r\nsimple groups of even type -- those of Klinger-Mason type and those of\r\nintermediate type.  The former are characterized as groups of both even\r\ntype and p-type for some odd prime p, and include approximately half of\r\nthe sporadic simple groups. The latter class roughly approximates the\r\ngroups with e(G) = 3 and includes most of the groups of Lie type of\r\nBN-rank 3 defined over finite fields of characteristic 2.  This project is\r\na collaboration with Inna Korchagina and Kay Magaard. The third project is\r\nto establish the non-existence of finite simple groups of even type having\r\na p-uniqueness subgroup for some odd prime p.  This project is a\r\ncollaboration with Gernot Stroth.\r\n\r\nFinite groups arise as the symmetry groups of discrete objects in many\r\nbranches of mathematics, as well as in chemistry and other sciences.  \r\nObjects having a high degree of symmetry generally have symmetry groups\r\nwhich are either almost simple groups or affine groups having almost\r\nsimple point groups.  As such, finite simple groups, and questions about\r\ntheir subgroups and representations by permutations or matrices, arise\r\nnaturally and pervasively in coding theory, crystallography, graph theory\r\nand number theory.  The ability of scientists and mathematicians to\r\nunderstand and use the symmetry groups which arise in their research\r\ndepends critically on recognition theorems, almost all of which rely\r\neventually on the classification theorem of the finite simple groups.  \r\nMany of these recognition theorems have been used in recent years to\r\ndesign powerful computer software for the efficient recognition of groups\r\nfrom fragmentary information, usually given by a generating set of\r\npermutations or matrices.  Again this relies fundamentally on the validity\r\nof the classification theorem of the finite simple groups. This project,\r\nin conjunction with other recently completed projects and a small number\r\nof well-accepted treatises and papers, will provide a coherent, reliable\r\nand readable source for the proof of this fundamental theorem. In\r\naddition, in the process, it is documenting a wealth of recognition\r\ntheorems and detailed subgroup information about the finite simple groups.\r\n",
