 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nPurpose and Intellectual Merit\r\nThe objective of this research is the systematic development of a mathematical theory for\r\nAeroelasticity drawing on Abstract Functional Analysis -- in particular nonlinear Aeroelasticity\r\n-- centered on the canonical problem of flutter: the instability endemic to aircraft at high enough\r\nair speed in the subsonic range, M < 1. In particular this would mean the development of\r\nmathematical models for aeroelastic phenomena of interest on their own and also explore\r\nanalytically the design of feedback controllers -- including self-straining actuators, \"intelligent\r\ncontrollers\" for Flutter Boundary Expansion.\r\nBroader Impact\r\nWe should point out that while aircraft wings (including UAV's) are the primary domain of the\r\ntheory, there is a new emerging area of application: Alternate Sources of Energy such as Wind\r\nTurbines -- where the aeroelastic stabilization of the blades is an increasingly important issue.\r\nLonger blades are apparently more efficient but reducing weight implies higher flexibility, just as\r\nwith UAV's.\r\nSpecific Tasks: First Year\r\nAnalytical study of the effect of nonzero angle of attack and nonzero camber on flutter speed as a\r\nfunction of Mach number, especially in the transonic range -- a currently unsettled problem. This\r\nwould mean in particular studying the linearized version of the nonlinear aeroelastic equation,\r\nleading to generalization of the Possio Integral Equation. In turn we will need to study the root\r\nlocus problem for the corresponding convolution-evolution equation, including the performance\r\nof self-straining actuator models -- still using the Goland cantilever beam model for the wing.\r\nSpecific Tasks: Second Year\r\nExtend the theory to where the structure is a uniform thin plate rather than a beam so that we can\r\nconsider controls on the leading and/or trailing edge of the wing. We could then investigate self-straining\r\nactuators -- piezo-strips chordwise as well as spanwise, eliminating ailerons. For a\r\nhigh-aspect-ratio wing we could still work with typical-section aerodynamics -- so that the\r\nnonlinear aerodynamic theory we have developed can be used without additional effort.\r\nSpecific Tasks: Third Year\r\nExtend the aeroelastic theory to finite wings finally eliminating the high-aspect-ratio constraint.",
