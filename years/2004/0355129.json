 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project engaging Ursinus College undergraduates in\r\nexperimental nuclear structure research. The project is part of an\r\nongoing collaboration with colleagues at the National Superconducting\r\nCyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and Florida State University (FSU)\r\ninvolving experimental work at the NSCL. The proposed work will\r\ncontribute to the understanding of proton and neutron contributions to\r\nlow-lying collective states in exotic nuclei outside the valley of\r\nstability. Proton and neutron contributions to nuclear excitations can\r\nbe disentangled by comparing transition strengths measured using pairs\r\nof complementary experimental probes. The advent of radioactive beam\r\ntechnology has enabled such investigations away from stability through\r\ninverse-kinematics proton scattering and Coulomb excitation\r\nmeasurements. We plan to investigate the persistence of shell\r\nstructure away from stability in neutron-rich exotic nuclei via\r\ninverse-kinematics proton scattering and test isospin symmetry in T=1\r\nisospin multiplets near mass A=50 via Coulomb excitation.\r\n\r\nA central goal of the project is to maintain an active research\r\nprogram in nuclear structure on the Ursinus College campus. Ursinus\r\nCollege is a national liberal arts college of about 1475 students with\r\na long history of strength in the sciences. This project will provide\r\nstudents opportunities to apply their knowledge of physics outside the\r\nclassroom, gain practical skills in data acquisition and analysis,\r\nobserve and participate in the operation of a nuclear accelerator\r\nfacility, and present their work to colleagues. Participants will\r\ntravel to the NSCL to perform experiments and analyze the data at\r\nUrsinus. They will present their results to the Ursinus community as\r\npart of the Ursinus College Summer Fellows Program and to the nuclear\r\nphysics community at American Physical Society/Division of Nuclear\r\nPhysics meetings.\r\n",
