 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\t\r\nA grant has been awarded to Florida Institute of Oceanography (FIO), University of South Florida, under the direction of Dr. John C. Ogden, to improve the small boat fleet at the Keys Marine Laboratory (KML). The KML commenced academic research and education programs in the 1980's through a public/private partnership between the Florida Institute of Oceanography (FIO)/State University System (SUS) and Sea World of Florida, Inc.  Based on the success of that partnership and recognizing the need for these programs and facilities the State of Florida purchased the KML in 1990.  The KML is presently managed by the FIO in cooperation with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, a state resource management agency. With the closure of other residential laboratory facilities in the region and the unprecedented scientific and political attention focused on the mosaic of South Florida environments, the KML has now assumed an even more critical support role.  In the last five years usage by research and education groups has increased steadily and is now exceeding some of the capabilities of the current facilities.  \r\n\r\nParticularly urgent is the need for a new boat with a larger capacity suitable for research and education groups of 12-15 persons.  The current fleet consists of 5 small boats, ranging in size from 10-24 feet.  The three largest boats together have a capacity of 18 students/scientists.  As the average educational groups at the KML range in size from 10 - 15 persons including 1 instructor this means that much of the time all three boats must be dedicated to a single educational group leaving no vessel support services for the researchers on site at the same time.  The residential capacity of the KML is 34 persons, therefore, one to three groups of 4-6 researchers are frequently on site with education groups.  While the interaction with the researchers enhances the educational experience for undergraduates, its value is diminished by the inability to provide adequate research support services.\r\n\t\r\nThis grant will partially fund the purchase of a 26' outboard vessel for support of the education programs.  The vessel will carry 15 students and faculty.  This will greatly alleviate the conflicts in boat usage when research and education groups are at the KML at the same time.  \r\n\r\n",
