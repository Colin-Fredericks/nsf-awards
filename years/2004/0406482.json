This part of the project can be thought of as an\r\nattempt to generalize and refine Gromov's Betti number theorem.\r\nThis research can be divided into three main parts:\r\n  (i) Finding new topological invariants which are finite on any family \r\nof ``similar'' manifolds which the PI has described.\r\n  (ii) Using the gradient push to limit the number of bundles with the\r\nsame fiber and base which can admit given lower curvature and upper \r\ndiameter bounds\r\n  (iii) Showing that simply connected spin manifolds with non-zero\r\nA-hat-genus can not be almost non-negatively curved.\r\nThe principal investigator also proposes to continue his study of\r\npositive functions of curvature which give a bounded integral\r\nalong any positively curved manifold with lower curvature bound,\r\nupper diameter and lower volume bound. This should clarify the\r\nnature of curvature tensors of Alexandrov spaces.\r\nThe PI would like to show that the curvature tensor for\r\nAlexandrov spaces is well defined as a measure valued tensor in\r\nany distance co-ordinates. If true, this should give a solution\r\nto such long standing questions as whether a convex surface in\r\nAlexandrov space is an Alexandrov space.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator proposes to compile a collection of\r\nexercises in modern geometry.  The idea is to find problems which\r\ncould be solved in one step.  However solutions are supposed to\r\nbe non trivial and would also lead to a discovery of important\r\nideas in modern geometry.  PI has already gathered some number of\r\nsuch problems which can be viewed online and many people had been\r\nengaged in this project.  This project is oriented toward\r\nstudents and young scientists.\r\n\r\nRiemannian manifold could be considered as a simplified version\r\nof space-time.  The author considers an approach to studing\r\nRiemannian manifolds. It is based on considering extremal\r\nmetrics, in an appropriate sense, for example how Riemannian\r\nmanifolds collapse to lower dimenssional objects. This method\r\nmakes possible to get new resuls in the main stream direction of\r\nRiemannian geometry: how to make conclusions about global\r\nstructure of space basing on local properties.\r\n",
