 "awd_abstract_narration": "Program Summary \r\n \r\nOver the past three years of   Phase II of the Washington-Baltimore-Hampton Roads \r\nLouis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (WBHR-LSAMP), three new state-based \r\ninstitutions were added.  The original four partners for Phase I included Howard University (HU), \r\nHampton University (HAU), Morgan State University (MSU) and the University of the District of \r\nColumbia (UDC). The new Phase II partners included Bowie State University (BSU), Norfolk \r\nState University (NSU) and Virginia State University (VSU).  The addition of these three partners \r\nexpanded the diversity of student populations served by the WBHR-LSAMP programs as well as \r\nexpanding the numbers of programs available to students enrolled in science, technology, \r\nengineering and mathematics (STEM) within the Alliance. \r\nIntellectual and Technical Merit \r\nThe principal objective for Phase III of the WBHR-LSAMP Alliance is to continue to \r\ninstitutionalize the . best practices. and . lesson-learned. from Phases I and II of the Alliance \r\nand to build the necessary instructional and research infrastructure that will ensure the successful \r\nprogression and transition of undergraduate students towards B.S., M.S and Ph.D. degrees in \r\nSTEM fields. The specific objectives for Phase III are to: \r\nProvide direct support for junior and senior-level students in order that they can \r\nsuccessfully transition into graduate programs in STEM fields and ultimately replace the \r\ngraying. professoriate in major research universities and the scientists and engineers at \r\nnational and industrial laboratories. \r\n\r\nTo develop seamless relationships and partnerships with major research universities so \r\nthat students within the WBHR-LSAMP programs completing B.S. and M.S. degree \r\nprograms can continue their graduate work with joint mentoring by professors at WBHR-\r\nLSAMP institutions and those offering Ph.Ds by .building bridges for the doctorates..   \r\n\r\nTo build synergistic research efforts for all STEM students so that institutionalization of \r\nthe WBHR-LSAMP initiatives will become permanent mechanisms for degree \r\nproduction at all levels in the postsecondary educational pipeline. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact \r\nBased on the trendline data, more than 7,500 African Americans have received B.S. \r\ndegrees in STEM fields from this WBHR-LSAMP Alliance over the past 10 years and \r\napproximately 30 percent or 2,200 of these students have gone on to enroll in  graduate degree \r\nprograms and have received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees as well as other professional degrees. The \r\nWBHR-LSAMP has documented evidence that the LSAMP students are more likely to return to \r\nHBCUs than other students. It is also clear by the number of Ph.Ds produced within the WBHR-\r\nLSAMP institutions, as well as the number of new assistant professors who have been hired \r\nwithin the WBHR-LSAMP Alliance, that the impact of the WBHR-LSAMP Alliance is not just \r\nwithin the alliance, but the impact is national as well as global.  We believe that that quality of \r\nAfrican American students attending institutions within the WBHR-LSAMP alliance is among \r\nthe highest in the United States. Furthermore, the establishment of new research partnerships will \r\nhave as its foundation the establishments of doctoral.level research at WBHR-LSAMP \r\ninstitutions. The combination of improved instructional and research facilities at WBHR-LSAMP \r\nInstitutions will have synergistic affects and benefits for  all of  the WBHR-LSAMP institutions, \r\nas well as the major research institutions that become research partners.  In particular, students \r\nparticipating in collaborative research benefit because they can be actively involved in a \r\ncomprehensive approach to research and development that is typically difficult to achieve in \r\nsmaller focused research groups such as those normally found in HBCUs and MIs where research \r\nresources are usually limited.",
