Degenerate equations arising from \r\ngeometry, fluid dynamics and several complex variables are also proposed.\r\nEquations with stochastic media are connected with properties of the\r\nobstacle problems.  New methods and new understandings to these problems \r\nare introduced.\r\n\r\nThe PI is working on problems from pure mathematics  and on issues from liquid \r\ncrystals and from geological underwater problems. The proposed research will be \r\nimportant for a wide interdisciplinary subjects. The PI is actively involved in the \r\ntraining and recruiting of post-doctors and graduate students. At the Mathematics\r\nDepartment of the University of Iowa, there is a student body about 100 graduate\r\nstudents from around the country and around the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
