 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will primarily involve work in two areas.  Mitchell has\r\nrecently answered a longstanding question of Shelah concerning the\r\napproachability ideal at the second uncountable cardinal, and the\r\nfirst area of research will further exploit these new techniques to better\r\nunderstand this ideal and other questions about closed unbounded\r\nsets.   A major aim will be to extend these ideas to the successor of\r\na singular cardinal.   The second area of research is in inner model\r\ntheory, where Mitchell will attempt to better understand the situation\r\njust below a Woodin cardinal and at very large cardinals where no\r\ncore model is presently known to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese questions concern the basic structure of the universe of sets.\r\nThe approachability ideal was defined by  Shelah for use in his analysis of\r\nsingular cardinals, such as the first infinite cardinal number which\r\nhas infinitely many smaller infinite cardinals below it.   The structure at\r\nsuch cardinals is much more difficult than the structure at regular cardinals,\r\nand the planned research could contribute significantly to its\r\nunderstanding. \r\nMuch research in set theory studies different the different possible\r\nforms that the universe of sets might take. It has been shown that, under appropriate\r\nassumptions, the \"core model\" provides an invariant skeleton which shared by all of these\r\npossible universes, and from which they derive much of their\r\nstructure.   The work on inner models will aim at an understanding of\r\nexceptional cases where this skeleton is not yet know to exist.\r\n\r\n",
