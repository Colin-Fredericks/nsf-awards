 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nACI-0305453; PI: AMARASINGHE\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that streaming media applications are already consuming most of the cycles on consumer machines.  StreamIt is a language and complier specifically designed for modern stream programming.  Its goal is to raise the abstraction level in the streaming domain., providing a natural, high-level syntax that conceals architectural details without sacrificing performance, and provide a language and compiler that can abstract away cognitive complexities of programming next generation, heterogeneous computing grids.  \r\nThe proposal will extend the current StreamIt language to include novel features such as variable rates, multi-dimensional streams, a messaging model and adaptable stream graphs so that the language can support a wide variety of applications in the streaming domain, and will also develop a large application base to evaluate the effectiveness of the language and the compiler.   In addition the project will undertake a substantial compiler effort to create a robust and powerful compiler.  With novel optimizations such as a space-time multiplexer, a stream graph partitioner, a phased scheduler a constraint scheduler, and liner transformer, as well as compilation technology necessary for heterogeneous computational platforms, and for substrates whose available resources can vary dynamically.  Furthermore, the project will develop many optimizing compiler backends for different communication exposed architectures as well as next generation computing grids\r\n",
