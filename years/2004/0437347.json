 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) funds\r\nevery year a summer graduate program in an area of interest\r\nto graduate students in mathematics.  The 2004 edition\r\nwill be held at the University of Notre Dame from June 8\r\nuntil June 27, 2004. The topic of the summer school will be on\r\ncoding theory and cryptography. About 60 graduate students,\r\n20 recent Ph.D's and 10 more senior researchers will participate\r\nin this three week event.\r\n\r\nThe summer school will combine both teaching and research. Half\r\nthe time will be devoted to teaching coding theory  and cryptography\r\nby some leading researchers in the field. During the other half of\r\nthe day groups of 3-4 graduate students will do research under\r\nthe supervision of a senior mentor who typically is a  recent PhD.\r\nA broad variety of research projects will be studied by the graduate\r\nstudents. The school will provide a learning and research experience\r\nboth for the graduate students and their senior mentors.\r\nDetails about the summer program and the studied research\r\nprojects can be found on the web:\r\nhttp://www.nd.edu/~cam/ima/\r\nNSF support helps to cover the travel expenses of participants.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
