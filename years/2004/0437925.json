 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to characterize the effect of intermolecular (i.e., chain-chain) interactions on the nature of delocalized charge carriers in organic materials by development of cofacially-held conjugated oligomers. The stacked geometry of the oligomers persists in solution and in the gas phase, and a combination of synthetic chemistry, electrochemistry, and spectroscopies (UV-vis-NIR, fluorescence, ESR, UPS) will allow us to explore the evolution of the electronic structure of molecules and polymer chains into that of 3-D materials.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merits of the proposed activity include: (i) an enhanced understanding of the influence of interchain interactions on the electronic properties of conjugated organic materials, (ii) new conjugated oligomers with enhanced mobility in field effect transistors by virtue of control over interchain geometry, and (iii) new spectroscopic data which will aid in the development of new quantum-based computational methods. The broader impacts resulting from the proposed study include opportunities for training of graduate students in a variety of techniques in a highly interdisciplinary research environment, as well as through proposed collaborations with Dr. Nadine Gruhn (University of Arizona), and Professors Bredas and Kippelen (Georgia Tech). Georgia Tech and the PI have a strong record of training graduates from underrepresented minority groups. Researchers will be recruited to this project from the diverse student population present in the School of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Georgia Tech.\r\n",
