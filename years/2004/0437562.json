The meeting is the eleventh of the series. ECCAD meetings have been held annually since 1994 at a variety of US East Coast locations. We estimate a turnout of about 100 participants from the Computer Algebra research community, doing either theoretical research or important applications in science and engineering. This year we expect some participants from the high performance computing research community as well, since recently there has been a vivid interest on computer algebra applications using high-performance computing. ECCAD'2004 will be preceded by a two-day workshop at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario, funded by the Fields Institute. Drawing on similar experiences from previous years, we expect an increase in the number of participants, because of the collocation of the two events. Participants will come mainly from the eastern half of North America and especially from the East Coast of the United States. The meeting will be comprised of three invited talks and contributed poster and software demonstration sessions, covering all aspects of computer algebra: theoretical research, software and applications. \r\n",
