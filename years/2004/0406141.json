 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is the first workshop to provide a forum for scientists studying issues related to soil biodiversity and its role in ecosystem functioning in Victoria Land, Antarctica. Research assessing the linkages of soil biodiversity to ecosystem functioning has accelerated globally in the past 15 years, with scientists from many nations investigating topics such as: the role of soil organisms in decomposition; their role in the transfer of materials and nutrients; and the relationships between aboveground diversity and belowground diversity, at local to global scales. Because the Victoria Land Antarctic system can be considered a model outdoor laboratory, studies conducted there have made unique contributions to these and other current important topics in biology, ranging from evolutionary biology to disturbance ecology. Here, as in few other ecosystems, scientists can examine how physical and chemical properties structure communities, and investigate the effects of disturbances such as soil warming on individual species and communities.\r\nA diverse range of participants, representing different nationalities, ages, disciplines, and experiences will meet to consider soils and soil biodiversity in the Victoria Land Region and to share and synthesize their research findings. They will assess the current understanding of soil biodiversity at levels that range from the molecular to the ecosystem and will determine the effects of human impacts in this region. They will compare and contrast these findings with other ecosystems and will define future research needs and priorities. \r\nThe broader impacts and intellectual merits of the workshop include investigating soil species biogeography and relating it to global biodiversity estimates, determining if there are key species in this fragile ecosystem, comparing organism survival strategies, and compiling all information to assess the vulnerability of soil biota to disturbance in this ecosystem. The workshop will also link Antarctic soil ecologists with researchers from international and NSF Long Term Ecological Research sites to provide a basis for comparison to other ecosystems and to engage new investigators in research at this polar site. Other broader societal impacts include infusing fresh, new ideas into existing and future research for understanding how soil species contribute to soil fertility, soil stabilization and linkages to sediments of streams and lakes. Overall, the research has ultimate use for soil sustainability. Finally, publications to the scientific community will be peer reviewed journal articles or a book on soil ecology in Victoria Land that will further extend the intellectual body of knowledge obtained through research.  \r\n",
