 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is a request for a three-year, youth-based program for 45 Chicago area youth.  It is a year-round program with a summer component that focuses on environmental science and technology education.  There is a major focus on job skills training together with work experience that respond to the general labor shortage for well-prepared science and technology professionals to fuel the 21st Century economy.  The program is geared towards teens who have limited opportunities in their own communities to study technology and who are primarily African Americans, Latinos, females or from other backgrounds that are under-represented in technology-based professions and from low-income communities.  Over the course of a three-year period, 15 students will be recruited each year, with 45 ultimately participating in the third year of the program, i.e. 90 budgeted participants including returning students.  Students receive an average of 365 contact hours each year for a total of 1,095 hours.  The program will produce a stream of technologically trained students from under-represented groups to enter the workforce or pursue education toward STEM careers.",
