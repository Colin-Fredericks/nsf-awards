 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Noyce Transition to Mathematics and Science Teaching (T-MAST) Scholars program educates and certifies people who hold a degree in science, mathematics, or engineering and who desire to change careers in order to teach middle school mathematics or science.  T-MAST is a fast-track four-semester Master of Arts degree program that features a paid job-sharing internship. Job-sharing is one of the most innovative characteristics of T-MAST.  It streamlines the pathway into the classroom for T-MAST Scholars by having two T-MAST Scholars job-share a vacant middle school position in mathematics or science.  During the regular school year, the T-MAST scholars each teach part-time in a middle school during the day, while attending graduate courses during the evening hours.  The knowledge and skills acquired from these graduate courses at the University of Central Florida are thus applied directly to instruction in public middle schools. The job-share position is highly mentored by both university personnel and a carefully chosen, accomplished teacher at the school where the T-MAST Scholars work.  Mentoring is continued in the year after the T-MAST Scholars complete the UCF program.  Additionally, T-MAST Scholars proceed through the program in a cohort group designed to promote the development of professional communities.",
