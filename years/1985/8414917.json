 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part of the science base required for development of machine systems is         knowledge and understanding of the phenomena which occur at the                 interface between tool and workpiece.  These phenomena are generally            complex, and the research required to understand them is difficult.             Usually several technical disciplines are involved, requiring a team of         experts.  This research is aimed at understanding what happens in and           near workpiece surfaces during the unit operation of grinding.  The             approach entails both theory and experiment.  The theory requires use           of mechanical, constitutive, and heat transfer equations, for both              surface and cyclindrical grinding.  Phase transformations must be taken         into account.  The finite element method will be used to calculate              temperature distributions and residual stress fields.  The experiments          will be performed on 304 stainless steel, 1040 carbon steel, 4340 alloy         steel, and 52100 steel.  Measurements will be made of grinding forces,          wheel speed, temperatures, residual strains, microhardness, and volume          fractions of transformed products.  Theoretical and experimental                results will then be compared.",
