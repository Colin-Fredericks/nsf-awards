 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this effort, research will be conducted on a beam of neutrons with           energies in the range from a few eV to a few keV with a minimal number          of gamma rays.  Several different filters have been developed to                produce beams of keV neutrons, but these have not beenoptimized. The            objectives of this program are to evaluate and optimize filters.  Three         subtasks are identified:  experimental measurements are made to compare         a number of filters, neutronics code analysis is made to optimize the           delivery of 1 eV to 30 keV, and code analysis is done to evaluate               partial coupling of the filter to the neutron source.  Development of a         high current, clean,intermediate energy beam is a nuclear engineering           project with applications to a number of subdisciplines such as                 dosimetry, medical applications, material damage studies, and                   nondestructive evaluation development.",
