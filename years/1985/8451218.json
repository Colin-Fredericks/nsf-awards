 "awd_abstract_narration": "An investigation of robot motion planning will be expanded using                configuration space.  Current planning methods do not take into account         the possibility of gross errors in the environment model, such as               unmodeled obstacles or surface defects.  These kinds of problems are            quite common outside of well-controlled environments such as                    laboratories and factories.  The challenge is to detect the error as            early as possible and to undertake corrective action without requiring          complete re-planning.  Further, this approach will be extended to               planning to deal with multiple moving objects whose motions are not             completely known in advance.  The idea is to be able to guarantee that          there exists a plan that achieves the goal as long as the other objects         move within their expected bounds.  Both of these extensions will build         on the basic idea that to plan ahead one does not need to know the              state of the environment exactly.",
