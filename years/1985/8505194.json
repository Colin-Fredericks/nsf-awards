 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mechanisms for reliability and crash recovery in distributed computing          systems are being studied, particularly in distributed database                 systems.  Tools are being developed for evaluating and comparing the            solutions; and using these and other tools, solutions for several               specific problems are classified and categorized.  The research                 emphasizes algorithm implementation and experimental performance                measurement on the new experimental network consisting of five                  computers with over one gigabyte of disk storage.  The goal is to               investigate novel algorithms for reliable operation, so the systems             implemented are used to drive the research.  That is, new algorithms            are implemented and evaluated in order to understand their strengths            and practical limitations.  This, in turn, suggests variations and              improvements on the algorithms that will lead in new directions.  Even          though the efforts center on system implementation, they continue to            use simulation and analysis when appropriate.",
