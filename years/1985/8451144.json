 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research focuses on two areas, the first dealing with combined              free-forced convection from a rotating horizontal cylinder.  The study          is experimental and is carried out by using air as the working fluid            and an existing wind tunnel to simulate the forced convection flow.             The cylinder is heated electrically and the constant heat flux                  condition is maintained on the cylinder boundary.  The results document         thoroughly the effect of the Reynolds number, the Rayleigh number, and          the angular velocity of the cylinder on the temperature and flow                fields.  The second area of research concerns convective instability in         superposed porous and fluid layers triggered by the combined action of          temperature and concentration gradients in the vertical directions.  In         the theoretical investigation, the critical parameters of the system            which yield convective motions are determined, as well as the nature of         these motions.  The theoretical findings are tested against                     experimental measurements.",
