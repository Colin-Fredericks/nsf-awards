 "awd_abstract_narration": "The qualitative properties of complex dynamical systems are                     investigated.  Such systems could be mathematically represented by              large interconnected systems of differential equations, integral                equations, partial differential equations, or a combination of these            types of equations.  The work will investigate the existence and                stability of oscillations, the stability of the equilibria, and the             input-output properties of such systems.  These topics are clearly of           great importance in theoretical studies and in application to specific          technological problems.  The methods will involve functional analysis           techniques, transformations, results from the theory of integral                manifolds, comparison theory for differential and integral equations            and the theory of resolvent operators for integral equations.  It is            expected that the results of this research will provide new methods to          investigate oscillatory behavior of complex feedback systems.  They             will also provide new methods of analyzing stability properties of              feedback control systems for large and complex dynamical systems.",
