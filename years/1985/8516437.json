 "awd_abstract_narration": "A two-day tsunami research workshop is conducted to develop a viable            research strategy and plans for future research in tsunami engineering.         The research needs and interests from other federal agencies that are           involved in tsunami research including the Department of Commerce               (NOAA), USGS, and the Department of the Navy are assessed.  Tsunamis            are a major hazard to lives and property in the U.S. coastal areas              including California, Hawaii, and Alaska.  Since 1946, tsunamis in the          U.S. have caused 355 fatalities and an estimated loss of coastal                recources of over 1/2 billion dollars.  A need for a tsunami research           planning meeting has been widely felt within the tsunami research               community and within federal agencies that support activities related           to tsunamis.",
