 "awd_abstract_narration": "Condensation phenomena have long been recognized as having a major              impact on the design and operation of steam turbines.  Early literature         on this subject and many studies over five or six decades have focused          on the homogeneous condensation as a mechanism for the initiation of            nucleation and condensation in the wet stages of steam turbines.  A             series of studies conducted in operating turbines first suggested in            1978 the possibility that turbine condensation was not originated by            homogeneous condensation because wet steam was found to be present at           the point in the turbine where the saturation ratio is equal to or              somewhat less than unity.  This discovery, which was made by surveys            ofoperating turbines with specially designed optical probes, has                prompted the focus of attention on other mechanisms of nucleation and,          in particular, on the role of heterogeneous nucleation as caused by low         levels of impurities present in the working fluid.  This research               effort will focus on  these processes and will explore a new range of           potentially pertinent physical effects.",
