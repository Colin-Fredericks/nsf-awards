 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electroslag welding is an automotable process having several                    advantages:  high rates of weld metal deposition, applicability to              thick sections (up to one foot or even more), low distortions due to            residual stresses, and cost-effectiveness if no post-weld heat                  treatment is required.  However, the process also has disadvantages:            wide heat-affected zone, large grains, and possible embrittlement due           to segregation of impurities in grain boundaries.  The disadvantages            are attributed to the high rates of heat input and the slow cooling.            The disadvantages are reduced by reducing the rates of heat input and           by stirring the weld puddle.  The materials used will be 2 1/4% Cr - 1%         Mo steel and HY 80 structural steel.  The speed of deposition will be           increased above normal rates, thus distributing the heat over a longer          weld distance.  Hollow strip electrodes filled with iron and manganese          powders will be used.  The weld pool will be stirred magnetically.  The         voltage-current diagram will be explored systematically.  Weldments             will be evaluated by x-ray and ultrasonic inspection methods,                   metallography, hardness traverses, and charpy V-notch tests (for                toughness).",
