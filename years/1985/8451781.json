 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research consists of studies in two areas, the first being                  convective boiling and two-phase flow in compact heat exchangers.  A            series of experimental and analytical studies is employed to                    investigate the effect of flow conditions, fluid properties, and                geometry on convective boiling heat transfer in channels with offset            strip fins.  Flow visualization studies and direct measurements of              local heat transfer coefficients are planned.  Convective boiling in            ribbed-plate and dimpled-tube geometries is also examined.  The second          portion of the project consists of experimental and theoretical studies         of mixed convection flows near the heated vertical walls of a                   rectangular enclosure in the presence of a horizontal forced flow.  For         different enclosure geometries, the experiments examine the interaction         between the forced-flow and buoyance mechanisms, and determine their            combined effects on flow and heat transfer.  Numerical predictions of           the flow field and heat transfer are developed concurrently and                 compared with the experimental results.",
