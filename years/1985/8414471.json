In this                  research, shock accelerometers and dynamic piezometers will measure the         ground motions and pressures generated by the blasts.  A Dutch cone             penetrometer and a dilatometer will record changes in the soil's                penetration resistance and modulus with time and distance from the              blast.  Relationships will be drawn between explosive energy, ground            motion, generated pressures, the degree of soil improvement, the                spatial extent of the improvement, and time.  Assessments will be made          as to whether current developments in situ instrumentation are adequate         for dynamic events.",
