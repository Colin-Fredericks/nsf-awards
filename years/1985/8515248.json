 "awd_abstract_narration": "Energetic materials is a collective name for a group of materials that          are capable of releasing energy by chemical reactions.  The group               includes explosives, propellants, and pyrotechnics, as well as other            chemical materials that can react and explode if improperly used or             handled.  The industrial use of energetic materials for military and            industrial purposes is increasing.  New technology is opening up new            applications beyond the uses in metal forming, oil recovery, mining,            etc.  Industry's increased usage and interest in this area represents           an opportunity for an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center           for Energetics Materials.  This project is studying the feasibility and         viability for an Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for            Energetic Materials at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.           Alternative organizations, policies, and operations for a center are            being studied.  The research interests and needs of industry in this            area being determined.  The potential for the envisioned center to              become self-sufficient with industry support is also being determined.",
