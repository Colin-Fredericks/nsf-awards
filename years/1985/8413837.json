 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-Scale Knowledge Base and Reasoning Systems are critical elements          in several research programs including those of NSF and DARPA.  Such            systems will require intelligent processing over very large amounts of          data organized under various knowledge representation schemes.  Current         Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology provides 'intelligent'                  processing over relatively small amounts of data stored under small but         rich knowledge representation schemes; Database (DB) technology                 supports efficient storage and retrieval of large data volumes stored           under large but simpler database schemes; evolving hardware                     technologies impact both areas.  These technologies must be integrated          to meet the requirements of Large Scale Knowledge Base Systems.  Funds          are provided to organize and run a three-day, limited attendance                workshop.  The goal of the workshop is to identify key technical                requirements, problems, approaches, and solutions to Large Scale                Knowledge Base and Reasoning Systems.  The second goal is to increase           the technology transfer between the AI and DB communities needed to             solve the identified open problems.",
