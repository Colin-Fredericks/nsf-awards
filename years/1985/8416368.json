 "awd_abstract_narration": "Highway bridges throughout the country are constructed to follow the            alignment of the highway roadway; consequently, some bridges are built          with a horizontal curvature.  The analysis and design of these bridges          is, therefore, a new design activity for bridge engineers and, in               addition, very little experimental data are available to substantiate           the design with respect to the dynamic response of these bridges during         an earthquake.  The research effort will be performed in conjunction            with a current project which is obtaining field data on the dynamic             response of a curved box bridge in New Zealand.  Researchers will               investigate and obtain actual data on the distortional and warping              modal properties of the bridge and will supplement the data obtained            for the soil-structure interaction and the coupling of the flexural and         torsional dynamic properties of the superstructure.  The data to be             obtained will be very useful in the development of analysis methods and         computer programs, and will also serve as a basis for design provisions         for highway bridges.",
