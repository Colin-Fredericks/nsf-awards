 "awd_abstract_narration": "Production planning and scheduling is an area of research that has              received much attention over the last two decades.  It includes long-,          medium-, and short-range planning.  Productivity is low if these                activities are not performed well.  Three problems in this area will be         investigated.  One involves medium-range planning:  enhancing                   algorithms that determine lot sizes and the scheduling of production            operations and raw material acquisition.  Better estimates of lead              times are expected from this work.  A second problem also involves              medium-range planning:  it takes account of uncertainty in multi-stage          manufacturing systems.  Better estimates of safety stock and safety             time are expected.  The third problem involves short-range planning:            development of an algorithm for detailed scheduling of production               operations, fast enough to deal efficiently and effectively with the            stream of disruptions that make many detailed schedules obsolete almost         as soon as they are created.",
