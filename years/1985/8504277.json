 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research continues in the area of advanced speech recognition                   algorithms, architectures, and experimentation.  Algorithms currently           being tested include an ear-model-based filterbank for speech                   recognition analysis, a dynamic programming solution for connected              speech recognition, and a DILEX approach for continuous digit                   recognition.  New algorithms are being investigated which apply expert          system technology and/or hidden Markov models or Markov random fields.          Finally, a training paradigm for large-vocabulary discrete utterances           recognition (thousands of utterances) is being developed using some of          these same ideas.  The largest real hardware project, Armstrong, a              distributed multiprocessor, is in its very early stages of construction         and consists of a unique network of some 100 M68010-based processors.           Another phase of the program relates to the development of a                    hardware/software tool designed to be a high-quality intelligent test           instrument for speech recognition systems.",
