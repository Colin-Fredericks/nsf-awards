Activities to be engaged in will cover a wide range of subjects         in the field of basic engineering and technology and will have been             identified as a result of discussions between both parties and with             other Government agencies.  A Cross-Disciplinary Research Committee             will be established to review the programs and management of the                Engineering Research Centers to help insure that a high quality                 research program is sustained over the long-term.  Further, a Committee         will be established to review and analyze the National                          ScienceFoundation's current and planned Engineering Programs within the         Engineering Directorate to improve the engineering research program.            In addition, the NAE will make recommendations to strengthen the                Engineering Directorate programs to meet the needs of engineering               fields which are of basic importance to the Nation's technical and              economic leadership and to contribute to the development of the                 manpower and research base for critical and emerging technologies in            the United States.",
