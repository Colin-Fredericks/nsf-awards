Efforts to be identified include cooperation          in developing the research-base required for manufacturing; in                  improving understanding of the economics of advanced automation; and in         education and training programs.  Major reasons that support is                 provided for cooperation in this area are:  adoption of manufacturing           technologies by U.S. industry is a matter of current national concern;          manufacturing research is central to the goal to insure that the U.S.           stays at the leading edge of engineering research; and in many areas of         manufacturing research, Western European institutions are \"ahead\" and           can contribute significantly to the U.S. efforts.",
