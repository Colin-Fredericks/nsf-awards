 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the goals of current research on machining is to provide                 adaptive control of metal removal operations, so that they can be               performed unattended by human operators.  This means that the control           system must be able to correct for slowly varying conditions such as            tool wear, and for sudden events such as tool breakage, formation of            tangling-type chips, on-set of chatter, and other phenomena.  The               general approach is to use the computer to make the in-process                  decisions that would normally be made by a human operator.  The                 principal investigator will study qualitative changes in the                    (empirical) physical models used to describe the metal cutting process.         The principles of these models will be embedded in the control                  computer.  Past and present data will be fed into the computer, which           will 'adapt' the system not only by changing the processing conditions,         but also, if required, by changing the process model.  Analytical work          will be followed by experimental evaluation.",
