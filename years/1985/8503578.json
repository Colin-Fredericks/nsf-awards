 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traffic control at intersections of highways and streets is currently           performed by pre-timed signal devices.  This method of controlling              traffic at an intersection is inefficient because the green and red             lights stay on for the present time whether there is traffic or not.            This project will investigate the feasibility of replacing the                  pre-timed devices with traffic actuated controls.  By this method, the          traffic in a particular highway or street will actuate the controls             when needed.  The technique will provide real-time optimization of the          traffic signal operations.  The benefits to be derived are increased            efficiency of traffic flow at intersections with an accompanying                decrease in air pollution.",
