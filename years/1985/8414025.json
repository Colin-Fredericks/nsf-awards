 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transport theory denotes the formulation and analysis of mathematical           models of the motion of particles at the microscopic level; the                 applications of these models range from particle movement in the                stellar atmosphere, gas dynamics, and fusion reactors.  Recently, these         methods have been extended to vehicular traffic flow, information               transfer, and medical diagnostics.  Travel support will be provided to          permit physicists, mathematicians, and engineers from the U.S. to               participate in the NinthInternational Conference on Transport Theory,           to be held in Italy in June 1985.  The conference will encourage the            exchange of information across disciplinary and geographical                    boundaries.  The Conference proceedings will be published as a special          issue of the journal, 'Transport Theory and Statistical Physics.' Thus,         transport theory is of both scientific and practical importance to the          U.S.  The participation of U.S. scientists and engineers in this                conference is necessary to assure the success of the conference and to          keep U.S. researchers abreast of developments in foreign research               centers in this field.",
