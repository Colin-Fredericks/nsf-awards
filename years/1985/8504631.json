 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in fabrication and analytical equipment have provided new              opportunities in superconductive materials and devices.  A new system           is procured for deposition and analysis to fabricate and study                  superconductive device structures.  The system has a load-lock chamber,         a sputter chamber with two well-isolated eight-inch heads, and a                separately pumped analysis chamber which is equipped with an X-ray              photoelectron spectroscopy system for surface analysis.  The system             also is equipped with an ellipsometer and a residual gas analyzer.  It          will be computer-controlled for accurate repeatability of depositions,          and wafer transfer from chamber to chamber is effected without opening          the system.  This system will be used to study two different types of           superconductive devices.  In one, niobium or niobium nitride electrodes         will be deposited on a crystalline silicon substrate that is heavily            doped in the (0.1um) gap between the electrodes.  The interfaces                between the electrodes and the silicon substrate are crucial and will           be analyzed using the ESCA system.  In the second case, whole-wafer             trilayers of niobium (or niobium nitride), amorphous silicon, niobium           (or niobium nitride) will be fabricated for use as Josephson junctions.",
