The purpose of the equipment is         to examine irradiance, illuminance, and longwave radiation presences            around existing test facilities.  Six goals determined the choice of            equipment:  to develop a better model for transforming global                   irradiance measured on horizontal surfaces to vertical surfaces; to             create an illuminance database; to examine patterns of sky luminance            and compare measurement data with generalized conventions; to generate          a correlation between hourly values of irradiance and illuminance; to           establish design condition illuminance values for use by architects and         engineers; and to establish data about the longwave radiant exchange            between buildings and the environment, with special attention directed          to determining patterns and rates of nocturnal radiation exchange.",
