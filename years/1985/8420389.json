 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many mechanical design problems are characterized by a large number of          variables that must be specified before the design is completed and by          a large number of constraints that must be satisfied for the design to          be feasible.  Under these conditions, mathematical optimization is              used; however, optimizing action can consume large amounts of human and         computer resources.  The principal investigator will extend his prior           work on the design of mechanical hands (robotic grippers) by studying           the unstated knowledge and rules that are used during the design                process.  One goal is to create a computerized tool that will perform           many of the time-consuming tasks normally required of a designer when           optimization techniques are used.  Another goal is to generalize the            design rules that are developed to mechanical designs other than                grippers.",
