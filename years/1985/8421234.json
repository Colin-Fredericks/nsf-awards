 "awd_abstract_narration": "Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction         in the U.S. and the world.  Reinforced masonry construction use is              increasing in moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent          features of economy, fire safety, architectural flexibility, and ease           of construction.  The present state of masonry structural analysis and          design and materials and construction technologies does not enable an           accurate prediction of building behavior under lateral loads such as            seismic loads.  This research project will coordinate the U.S.-Japan            Coordinated Program for Masonry Building Research.  The U.S. side of            the program consists of over 20 separate research tasks that must be            coordinated to attain the program goals.  Among the activities that             will be performed are organizing and conducting meetings with the task          researchers, monitoring program progress, expediting data exchange              between researchers, interfacing with the masonry industry to arrange           for materials and establish researcher-user group communication, and            interfacing with the UJNR panel and the Japanese research program.",
