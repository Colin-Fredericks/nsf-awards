 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research suggests enhancements to relational database systems              which will allow them to effectively support expert system applications         with a large knowledge base and/or database.  The basic premise of this         research is that relational database systems (with some modest                  extensions) may offer superior performance and ease of expert system            constructions in some applications.  These applications are                     characterized by a very large knowledge base or database.  The study            investigates extensions to relational database systems which will               facilitate their application in such environments.  Research is                 performed on how to optimize such an extended relational system so it           will be able to offer superior performance compared to other                    programming environments in which one might construct large expert              systems.",
