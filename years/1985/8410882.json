 "awd_abstract_narration": "Communication and imaging through the atmosphere, the ocean, the                geophysical medium, or the biological medium by electromagnetic and             acoustic waves are often severely affected by the random spatial and            temporal variations of the medium.  Although considerable progress has          been reported on the interactions of waves with such random media, some         fundamental questions are still not resolved, impeding progress in              several important areas of application.  Theoretical formulations for           these problems are often complex, involving various assumptions and             approximations, and their range of validity is difficult to determine.          The researchers are attacking these problems using both analytical and          experimental methods.  The experiments are carefully controlled so that         the results can be compared with theoretical predictions and extended           by numerical computations.  The results of these studies may be useful          in various applications including atmospheric optics, ocean acoustics,          geophysical remote-sensing, radars, lidars, ultrasound imaging, and             optical inverse scattering of random inhomogeneous media.",
