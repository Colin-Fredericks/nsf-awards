 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposes a methodology for designing                              two-degree-of-freedom (performance and stability margin) multivariable          feedback control systems.  A quadratic cost functional is used to               measure such performance attributes as tracking error, saturation, and          sensitivity to small plant perturbations.  Stability margin is measured         with an L-infinity norm on an appropriately chosen stability margin             matrix.  A mechanism for tradeoff between performance and stability             margin will be investigated.  This mechanism is different from the one          recently described in the literature and shows promise of being more            powerful.  In addition, the choice of the stability margin matrix will          be investigated.  Another important consideration in the design of              multivariable control systems is decoupling (each command input                 controlling only one output).  The structure proposed here is well              suited to the decoupling problem since it permits the separation of the         problem of decoupling from the problem of realizing a desirable                 stability margin.  There is, however, a decoupling constraint which can         deteriorate achievable performance.  A portion of this research will be         directed towards developing a design procedure which minimizes this             performance deterioration.",
