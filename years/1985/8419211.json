 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aerobic coupling reactions which are induced catalytically by binuclear         copper compounds will be investigated to uncover additional couplig             systems which are of commercial and scientific interest in synthesis            and separation processes, and to fill in existing gaps in the                   understanding of existing aerobic coupling reactions.  New combinations         of catalysts, ligands, and solvents will be sought which are more               effective than those presently known.  In addition, the possibility             will be examined that surfactants and cross-coupling reactions between          different compounds may greatly enhance the engineering potential of            aerobic coupling reactions, and the effect of ultraviolet light on              these reactions will be determined.  Finally, polymer-supported                 catalysts with binuclear structures will be designed to support                 specific coupling reactions.  These new systems may lead to novel               processes for the removal of toxic and hazardous organic compounds from         aqueous solutions and for the recovery of certain types of biochemical          compounds.",
