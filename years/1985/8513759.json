 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will identify and critically appraise the concepts and              methods of measurement and evaluation in planning and management of             water resources developed by the social and behavioral sciences, with a         major emphasis on bridging the gap between the engineering/physical             sciences and the social/behavioral sciences.  Two documents will be             prepared:  first, a review and assessment; second, specific papers              prepared and presented at a national conference, to be held in October          of 1986, that will illustrate the topics presented in the first                 monograph.  A steering committee broadly representative of the                  disciplines concerned with water resources management issues will be            responsible for the preparation of the first document, the organization         of the conference, and the preparation of the proceedings of the                conference.  The final product will be an assessment and illustration           of what has been accomplished and implemented, and an identification of         future research needs in water resources management.",
