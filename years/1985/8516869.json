The             symposium is intended as a means to stimulate active future research            cooperation in selected subject areas of mutual concern.  Turkey, being         one of the most active regions of seismicity in Eurasia, is experienced         in earthquake problems and resourceful in research.  The Symposium will         provide an adequate forum for scientists/engineers from both sides to           explore opportunities and challenges in the problem areas of seismic            network, ground motion study, risk and hazard analysis, and structural          engineering.  The discussion will be focused on the methods and                 technical approaches to characterize earthquake ground motions and to           design and maintain facilities to minimize loss of lives and property           due to earthquakes.",
