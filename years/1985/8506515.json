 "awd_abstract_narration": "A high quality three-dimensional graphics computer work station will be         obtained.  The work station will consist of a real-time image                   acquisition and a HP 9000 computer that will be housed in the                   Microsystems Laboratory of the University of Maryland.  The image               acquisition system consists of two video color cameras together with            video digitizers and preprocessors.  The HP 9000 computer is a 32-bit           processor system supported by powerful and flexible software to                 accommodate diverse demands.  The work station will be utilized to              support the research of twelve cooperating faculty members and their            students from diverse segments of the University (in the College of             Engineering, the Division of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and the             Medical School).  The research projects include:  microcomputer-based           control and analysis in neural networks, intrinsic 3D curve                     characterizations for robots, cytoskeletal studies through                      computer-based feature extraction techniques, semiconductor device              modeling, hysteretic semistate described systems, goal-seeking                  cybernetic systems, 3D solid-state device structures, control of large          interconnections of robots, real-time and distributed program systems,          repetitive adjustment technique for robot control, robot component              fracturing, and CAD of microwave amplifiers.",
