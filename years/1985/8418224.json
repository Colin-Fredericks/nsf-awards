 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is formulated to develop response spectrum techniques for           analysis and design of offshore steel platforms subjected to earthquake         and wave excitations.  Unlike conventional structures, offshore                 structures are surrounded by water; the interaction between the                 structure and water gives rise to added mass and hydrodynamic damping.          Furthermore, because of the existence of the relative magnitude of              inertia and drag forces associated with either earthquakes or wave              actions, the manner in which the response spectra are affected is               investigated.  For earthquake loading, the importance of a nonlinear            drag term on structural response for an entire range of structural              characteristics is examined.  For wave loading, a narrow-based wave             model is used as a first approximation. The study will lead to a                rational framework for the design of offshore structures based on the           concept of a response spectrum.",
