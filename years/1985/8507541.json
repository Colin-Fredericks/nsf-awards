 "awd_abstract_narration": "In view of the increasing importance to the U.S. economy of petroleum           and other natural resources that may originate beneath ice-infested             waters in the Arctic, considerable industrial interest has been                 recently generated for establishing a University/Industry Cooperative           Center for Ice Research to be located at Dartmouth College.  This high          degree of interest has been generated primarily because petroleum and           its by-products are essential to our economy and because approximately          60 percent of the total undiscovered domestic oil and approximately 50          percent of the undiscovered gas may lie beneath ice-infested waters off         the coast of Alaska.  As Arctic engineering thus begins to play an              increasingly important role in our economic development, the need for a         thorough documentation and understanding of the properties of ice,              particularly of saline ice, as well as trained scientific and                   engineering personnel to provide such information will increase.  Thus,         the operational phase of the Industry/University Center for Cold                Regions Science and Engineering at Dartmouth College is initiated.",
