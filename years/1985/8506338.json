 "awd_abstract_narration": "Until recently, there was no technique to adequately validate many              nonlinear models of a device/system in CAD.  This method represents the         device's nonlinearity as a finite Volterra series and uses a multi-tone         test signal to measure the Volterra kernels.  In contrast to previous           work, no assumptions are made about the kernel's form; thus,                    measurements are useful for complex systems where no simple model is            obvious.  Currently, the technique is applied to low-frequency devices          (acoustic tranducers and audio signal processors) with subtle                   nonlinearities.  Signal generation/acquisition and processing equipment         have restricted the characterization of the high/very high frequency            devices commonly used in CAD, VLSI, and communications circuits.  The           proposed equipment would permit the study of models for devices                 operating up to 1 GHz and models which incorporate stronger                     nonlinearities.  A system is specified that is composed of LeCroy               Research Corp. high speed CAMAC modules for very high speed waveform            input (1 GHz aggregate sample rate, 8-bit word) and output; and a               Masscomp real-time UNIX Computation System for control of the CAMAC             crate (via IEEE-488 interface), lower speed high resolution studies             (imHz 12-bit word), computation, and kernal display.",
