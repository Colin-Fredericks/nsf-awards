 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both experimental and theoretical investigations of nonlinear                   dispersive wave effects and of acousto-optic effects are performed.  As         regards nonlinear waves, the researchers are continuing a                       physics-oriented, partially heuristic approach toward two- and                  three-dimensional solutions.  As regards acousto-optic effects, they            are continuing the plane wave multiple scattering approach using Feyman         diagrams.  In addition to continuing these efforts, two new                     investigations, closely related to the subjects mentioned, are being            started.  The first one is to broaden the solition investigations to            include related aspects (such as bistability, chaos, parametric                 interactions, etc.) where such aspects are relevant in providing deeper         understanding and physical insight.  The second new investigation is to         make a thorough comparison of the physics-oriented and the                      mathematics-oriented approaches toward acousto-optics.  The final goal          of the program is to acquire physical insight into esoteric concepts to         assess their applicability to the field of electrical engineering, both         in terms of analytic tools and devices.",
