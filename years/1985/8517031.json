 "awd_abstract_narration": "Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction         in the U.S. and the world.  Reinforced masonry construction use is              increasing in moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent          features of economy, fire safety, architectural flexibility, and ease           of construction.  The present state of masonry structural analysis and          design and materials and construction technologies does not enable an           accurate prediction of building behavior under lateral loads such as            seismic loads.  This research project will provide the preliminary              design of the full-scale masonry research structure for the U.S.-Japan          Coordinated Program for Masonry Research.  This is necessary to allow           integration and coordination of the experimental and the analytical             tasks with the design tasks for ultimate use in establishing a rational         limit state design methodology for masonry building construction.  This         research project includes development of the preliminary design for the         research buildings, estimation of story shear capacity, estimation of           interstory force-displacement characteristics in both the elastic and           inelastic range, and integration of these data with the experimental            and analytical research projects.",
