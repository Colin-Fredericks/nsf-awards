 "awd_abstract_narration": "A design can be described in a number of different contexts or                  languages.  Typically, an engineer describes a product in terms of a            set of performance specifications and constraints.  These constitute a          functional description of the product.  The mechanical designer or              draftsman uses a set of drawings to describe the form of the product.           The manufacturing engineer uses a process sheet to describe the product         in terms of the means for fabrication.  The design task is to specify a         form of the product to best satisfy constraints or objectives on                function and fabrication.  The relationships among function, form, and          fabrication are studied.  These relationships are the basis for design          decisions and are essential when considering design scaling, design             modifications to accommodate restrictions on materials, machinery, or           tooling or in the consideration of standards and tolerancing.                   Currently, these relationships are poorly understood.  Without a better         understanding, designers will continue to use empiricism and heuristics         to design.",
