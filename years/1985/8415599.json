 "awd_abstract_narration": "When a model of a one-dimensional (1-D) system is known precisely, many         properties of interest, e.g. stability, can be investigated through the         analysis of a set of polynomials in one independent variable.  A                difficulty in such an analysis is that the set of polynomials may be            infinite and the question arises of how to reduce the study of this             infinite set to the study of a finite set of low order.  Furthermore,           the coefficients appearing in the set of polynomials are generally not          known precisely and only bounds on the coefficients can be given.  This         brings up the question of the robustness of the properties of interest          to parameter variations.  For 1-D systems, these two questions have             been reasonably well resolved.  The goal of this research is to                 generalize certain results regarding the above questions for 1-D                systems to two- or three-dimensional systems.  Such systems are                 important in a number of engineering applications such as optical image         processing and robotics.  In particular, the two general research tasks         are property invariance of n-dimensional polynomials under coefficient          perturbations, and polynomial irreducibility and a type of spectral             factorization.",
