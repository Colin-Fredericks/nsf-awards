 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous research has demonstrated a new microwave ring resonator based         on guided magnetostatic surface waves, which are guided around a closed         circular path using a nonuniform in-plane magnetic bias field.  This            research extends the investigation to examining a rotation rate sensor,         or tachometer.  In such an application, the transducers remain                  stationary while the ferrite film supporting the waves is rotated. The          rotation rate is determined from the additional phase shift of the              waves caused by the motion of the medium.  Such a tachometer could, in          principle, exhibit a response time as short as several hundred                  nanoseconds.  The ability to make virtually instantaneous rotation rate         measurements would contribute to the stability and speed of many                control systems used with industrial processes and robotics.  The               research has both the experimental portion and theoretical studies of           magnetostatic waves in moving media.",
