 "awd_abstract_narration": "The classical nonlinear programming problem formulation is often too            rigid to adequately describe an engineering design problem.  A design           methodology is developed based on a problem formulation featuring three         types of specifications:  hard constraints, soft constraints, and               objectives.  In relation with this methodology, two central issues are          addressed:  the need for powerful optimization algorithms in an                 engineering context and the need for efficient ways of conveying to the         designer information about the possible tradeoff designs.  The effort           in algorithm development will focus on superlinearly convergent                 algorithms.  Existing methods will be adapted to minimax problems and           modified to take into account various requirements arising in an                engineering design context.  The work on enhancing the communication            between computer and designer will investigate ways of evaluating               potential tradeoffs without performing costly simulation runs.  Also,           efficient ways will be sought for graphically conveying to the designer         the information obtained.  Finally, the various techniques thus                 developed will be implemented in the DELIGHT system and tested on               various types of design problems.",
