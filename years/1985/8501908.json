This conference, which         is the seventh in a series of conferences, seeks to emphasize work on           the effects of VLSI on the design of algorithms and on the design of            complete, integrated systems.  Attendance will be by invitation only,           and participation is expected from all the leading universities,                industrial firms, and governmental agencies associated with VLSI                research.  A printed Proceedings will be distributed at the conference,         and the formal proceedings published. These conferences serve an                important role in transferring new research ideas from universities             into industry.  It also serves to feed back industrial and other                practical constraints to the university participants, and thereby help          assure that university research is consistent with the long-term needs          of industry.",
