 "awd_abstract_narration": "The thermodynamic properties of electrolyte mixtures are studied.  The          isoactive-solvent theory developed in this work is based upon a                 semi-grant canonical ensemble, for which the solvent activity is the            independent variable and the thermodynamic excess functions are                 expressed in mole ratios.  Preliminary evaluations indicate that                vapor-liquid equilibria predicted by the theory are in excellent                agreement with experiments on ternary systems containing mixed solutes          and/or mixed solvents.  The theory is being tested for various classes          of systems under a wide range of conditions and compared with                   established theories and correlations.  Isopiestic experiments from 25          to 100 C are performed for aqueous solutions containing non-volatile            electrolytes.  In these measurements, the activity of the solvent is            determined simultaneously for single and mixed solutes.  Therefore, the         theory can be compared directly with experiment without interpolating           between experimental points.",
