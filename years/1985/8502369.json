 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with an investigation of a relatively new method of         polymerization, discovered a few years ago in Japan.  The propagating           species in the polymerization is a so-called zwitterion, i.e., a                molecule having both an electrically negative and a positive charge.            The polymerization has considerable potential for the preparation of            entirely new types of polymers.  A major limitation has been the low            molecular mass that previous workers have obtained.  This research aims         to understand better the individual steps in the polymerization process         to control them in such a way as to increase the mass, and hence                utility, of the products.  Efforts are underway to increase the size of         the polymers and to study the kinetics and mechanisms of polymerization         in some carefully chosen chemical systems.  Attention will also be paid         to the possible influence of the crystal structure and dimensions of            zwitterions.",
