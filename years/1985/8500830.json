 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is concerned with the match of algorithms for             signal processing with architectures to solve complex large-scale               problems in a variety of engineering applications.  Modern signal               processing algorithms are normally described in terms of linear algebra         and signal processors employ matrix-vector techniques suitable for              various linear algebra computations.  Both architectures and algorithms         are inherently parallel in nature.  Parallel architectures and                  algorithms in linear algebra for signal processing forms the basis of           this research.  This research describes a new type of optical linear            algebra processor (OLAP) that uses optical elements to achieve high             speed performance and parallelism.  A novel digital OLAP architecture           is proposed which operates on digital binary-encoded numbers for                high-accuracy.  The new architecture achieves digital multiplication by         optical convolution.  Specific problems will be examined to determine           quantitative performance, error analysis, and optimum algorithm                 development.  The applications to be addressed include:  the solution           of partial differential equations by finite differencing methods, the           solution of structural mechanics problems using finite element methods,         and computational fluid mechanics problems.",
