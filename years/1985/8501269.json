 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program is aimed at understanding how the central nervous system           (CNS) responds to injury.  In particular, a growth response is studied          that involves the invasion of the hippocampal formation in the rat              brain by axons that are normally restricted to blood vessels.  This             growth response occurs only when specific areas of the CNS are damaged          and appears to be due to the presence of a neuronal growth factor               similar in nature to the classical nerve growth factor (NGF).  Since            other axons do not grow in response to the damage, this neuronal                rearrangement appears to be a specific response to injury of the CNS.           To determine whether the growing axons come into direct contact with            CNS neurons, the researchers are using electron microscopic techniques.         Studies of the growth factor involve the use of tissue culture                  procedures that allow for the detection of small quantities of neuronal         growth factors.  These studies of neuronal growth following CNS injury          should assist in unraveling the complex biological mechanisms that              regulate the normal development of neuronal connections.",
