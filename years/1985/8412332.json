 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the transport of polymer chains within porous             media focusing on systems where the mean chain dimension is comparable          to or exceeds the pore size.  A solution of high molecular weight               polymer is forced by pressure through microporous membranes; polymer is         larger than the pores and hence will not pass through the membrane at           low throughputs.  However, at higher solvent flowrates the polymer              chains can deform and some of them will enter the pores.  The                   dependence of polymer rejection on solvent flow rate will be measured           and these results will be correlated with molecular properties of the           polymer.  Successful completion of this work may contribute to an               understanding of the deformation of polymer chains in converging                solvent flow fields, as well as provide insight into separation of              polymeric materials by ultrafiltration.  Additionally, adsorption of a          polyelectrolyte onto the surfaces of a porous membrane will be studied          and transport rates of solvent and other small molecules through the            partially blocked pores will be measured.  This work also explores the          feasibility of creating membranes, modified by adsorbed polymer, whose          permeability can be controlled by selectively changing solution                 properties.",
