 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study investigates the phenomenon of soil liquefaction induced by          low levels of ground shaking.  The results of the engineering research          on soil liquefaction, to date, provide only a limited understanding of          the relationship between the earthquake intensity and soil                      liquefaction.  The general assumption is that liquefaction occurs at            high earthquake intensities (for example, above intensity VI in                 Modified Mercelli Intensity Scale).  An investigation of this phenomena         is likely to provide new insight into understanding the liquefaction            process.  A labortory test program will be conducted of cyclic triaxial         compression tests on very loose to medium dense saturated sands and             conditions will be determined that will trigger liquefaction.  A                correlation of the experimental data will be made with the analysis             results of liquefaction at moderate levels of ground shaking.  The              results will establish the initial stress conditions and the effects of         superimposed dynamic stresses on the potential for progressive failure          of slopes.",
