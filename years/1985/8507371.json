 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers have been working for 10 years on various aspects of                injection molding, treated separately:  material properties, fluid              flow, heat transfer, machine characteristics, plastic part design, etc.         They will integrate these various aspects to include the computer-aided         design of plastic parts, and to cover computer control of the process.          They will extend their activities to include injection molding of               materials other than pure thermoplastics, e.g., thermosets and                  fiber-filled composites.  Researchers will test packages applicable to          the design of plastic parts, test and evaluate existing geometric               molding systems in terms of their modeling capability for constructing          a part and the tooling needed to produce the part, formulate techniques         for adaptively controlling the molding process, and develop the                 software to integrate a complete CAD/CAM system for plastic parts.              They will study flow of molten plastics through openings of various             sizes and shapes in molds; determine how thermoplastics pack, cool, and         shrink in molds; investigate the mechanical properties of molded parts          as they are affected by alternative mold-design configurations and              processing conditions; and simulate and investigate the injection               molding of thermosetting plastics and polymers containing fillers such          as glass fibers.",
