 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large scale radio networks are growing rapidly because of the demand            for the transmission and sharing of information among many users.  A            key feature of these networks is that each transmission is a potential          source of interference for all terminals within range of the                    transmitter.  For such networks the use of spread spectrum signaling is         highly desirable.  Spread spectrum systems are characterized by the use         of one or more distinct codes assigned to each terminal and modulated           onto the carrier along with the digital data.  Since most of these              signaling techniques combat multiple-access interference without                stringent power requirements, they are suitable for radio networks with         mobile nodes.  The specific research objectives include:  development           and analysis of purely broadcast spread-spectrum communication schemes,         exploration of the efficient use of channel access protocols for                (single-hop) spread-spectrum radio networks, performance evaluation of          single-hop, spread-spectrum cellular mobile radio networks, and                 analysis and design of multi-hop, spread-spectrum radio networks.",
