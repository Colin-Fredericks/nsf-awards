 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research centers on the application of state-of-the-art computer           science technologies and the development of advanced computer                   applications for engineering problems, with an emphasis on the civil            engineering domain.  The work is directed towards an exploration of how         computer-based technologies can be applied to engineering problems, and         how the various facets of the engineering process can benefit from such         computer applications.  The basic strategy is to identify problem areas         where computer aids will be beneficial along with maturing computer             technologies which can be applied to the problems, and to investigate           the resulting issues.  Specific research includes finite element                systems, database management systems, and integrated computer-aided             engineering systems.  The objective throughout is to explore how                computer technologies can be best utilized to create a friendly,                responsive, and powerful computer-based engineering environment.",
