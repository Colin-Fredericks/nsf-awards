 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program of research focuses on two areas which will help the               development of high performance optical fiber communication systems.            The first deals with semiconductor lasers capable of stable, single             wavelength operation and the second is concerned with nonlinear                 coupling in waveguides.  In the laser problem area, a comparison of the         various known schemes for mode stabilization will be made along with            the experimental study of new techniques.  The expected performance of          various mode stabilized lasers will be examined and possible ways to            fully utilize their potential will be explored.  Research will also be          conducted on coupled waveguides for pulse shaping and for power                 combining from two or more lasers.  Included in the study are the               nonlinear refractive and absorptive properties of multiple quantum well         (MQW) structures and the spectral behavior of MQW lasers; the former            for possible use in guided-wave optics and the latter for possible use          as a tunable source.",
