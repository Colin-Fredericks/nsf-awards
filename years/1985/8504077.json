 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will investigate a variety of topics in discrete                  optimization.  The models derive from integer programming problems of           broad applicability in operations research, computer science, and many          areas of the natural, engineering, mathematical, and social sciences.           The apparent computational intractibility of the most general such              models is well known; thus, highly structured combinatorial                     optimization models are the focus of the proposed research.  The models         to be studied are frequently directly applicable to real-world problems         and in other instances serve as components in solution methodology for          more general models.  Algorithmic insight gained from study of such             highly structured models is often a useful guide in the design of               heuristic solution procedures of general applicability.  Two major              research projects are proposed.  First, a classification scheme for             combinatorial packing and covering models is proposed as a means to             guide further research on problems related to supply-demand networks,           production scheduling, stock cutting, two-terminal cut packing,                 branchings, and vertex packing.  Second, a linear duality model is              proposed as a unifying framework for investigating duality properties           of linear subspaces, polyhedral cones, rational geometric lattices, and         certain classes of integer programming problems.",
