 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will develop and verify models for two-phase flow         in turbulently agitated liquid-liquid dispersions.  The results will            have direct utility for scale-up of interphase transport processes              occurring in these systems.  The proposed model incorporates dispersed          phase micromixing due to coalescence and breakage of droplets.  The             turbulent momentum and energy balance equations for the continuous              phase are coupled to the dispersed phase through the friction term.             Simultaneous solution of the drop population balance equation permits           calculation of the local drop size distribution, dispersed-phase                micromixing, and the frictional losses of the continuous phase for a            distributed system.  The hydrodynamic and dispersed phase models are            coupled to the conservation equation to model interphase transport.             Experiments are conducted for physically equilibrated liquid-liquid             dispersions in vessels over two orders of magnitude to measure                  spatially dependent drop size data for comparison with model                    prediction.  Measurements of mean flow and turbulence are made for              comparisons with and verification of the turbulence transport model.",
