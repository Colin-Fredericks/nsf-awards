 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of structured singular value was recently introduced as a           tool for the analysis and synthesis of feedback systems with structured         uncertainties.  It was found later to be a key to the design of control         systems under joint robustness and performance specifications and to            very nicely complement the H;io;io approach to control system design.           The algorithms proposed so far for the computation of the structured            singular value are computationally very demanding.  Thus, corresponding         design procedures, requiring a large number of such evaluations, are            currently impractical.  There is a need for efficient methods for the           evaluation of the structured singular value as well as for optimization         algorithms capable of handling corresponding design specifications.             The purpose of this research is to take a first step in that direction.         More particularly, the algebraic and geometric properties of the                structured singular value are studied and, based on these properties,           efficient algorithms for its computation are devised.",
