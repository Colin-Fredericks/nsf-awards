The ICOSSAR            conferences, including the one proposed in Kobe, Japan, in 1985, are            international in participation and significance.  Subjects covered in           the conferences encompass such areas as civil engineering, space                structures, naval architecture and marine engineering, nuclear power            plants, mechanical engineering, and materials science, as well as               earthquake and wind engineering.  U.S. participation in all past                ICOSSAR conferences has always played an important role in terms of the         organization of the conferences as well as technical contributions.             Support will be provided for the travel of a limited number of U.S.             experts and specialists in structural reliability.",
