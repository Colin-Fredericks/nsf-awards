 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is concerned with developing the mathematical theory of           control of partial differential equations and hereditary systems                appropriate for applications to large elastic structures.  This work            will clarify a number of issues associated with active control of large         aerospace structures such as space antennas and platforms and wings of          high performance aircraft.  Since the aerospace structures under                consideration are spatially distributed, they are inherently infinite           dimensional.  As such, their proper modeling and analysis requires              partial differential equation techniques.  This research seeks to               develop control strategies by direct studies of various appropriate             infinite dimensional models.  It is a broadbased program, ranging from          theoretical studies of distributed and delayed controllers to practical         construction of numerical algorithms for feedback stabilization of              vibration, flutter, and rigidity.",
