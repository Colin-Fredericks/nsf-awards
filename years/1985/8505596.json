 "awd_abstract_narration": "The international building research community is meeting in Washington,         DC, during September 21-26, 1986, at the International Council for              Building Research, Studies, and Documentation's (CIB) 10th Triennial            Congress (CIB.86).  A travel grant program is being established to              enable a number of highly qualified technology experts to attend                CIB.86.  Many research organizations and universities have qualified            staff but lack the resources for travel per diem and registration fees          to attend meetings other than their respective professional societies.          It is important for the U.S. building community and CIB to attract as           many experts to participate in this Congress as possible, to share a            broader knowledge of building research, and to further extend                   technology application.  The end goal is improved building practices            for a better quality of life worldwide.  This travel grant program              supports economy airfare, per diem and subsistence expenses, and                registration fees.",
