 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to generlize and clarify a number of               recent results on periodic optimal control theory.  In particular, a            number of theoretical and computational issues will be investigated: to         show that the sufficiency condition, if weakened in a minimal way, is           also necessary; to show how a neighboring optimum periodic regulator            can be constructed and, for a special class of systems, generalized to          obtain global stability to a limit cycle; to study the relationship of          this periodic regulator with that of the linear-quadratic regulator and         its associated symmetric algebraic Riccati equation; to indicate how            the periodic constraints, bounded state and/or control constraints, can         be included in the periodic optimal control formulation; to determine           the effects on robustness of uncertain dynamical systems by using               periodic feedback gains; and to extend the necessary and sufficient             conditions to quasi-periodic optimal control problems with slowly               varying parameters.  It is expected that these results could have               significant impact on such diverse areas as chemical process control            and flight mechanics.",
