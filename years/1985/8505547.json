 "awd_abstract_narration": "Support will be provided for a workshop devoted to control systems              governed by partial differential equations and application of the               theory to control and stabilization of large, flexible structures.              There is currently great interest in control of large flexible                  structures because of the number of such structures requiring active            control for acceptable performance.  These include flexible arms of             robots, large communication and intelligence satellites, orbiting               platforms and power stations, and manned space stations.  They are              typically highly flexible, consisting of a large number of beam-like            elements coupled together end-to-end in the form of a chain, with               components mathematically modeled by large systems of ordinary and              partial differential equations.  The main purpose of the proposed               workshop is to determine what the basic problems are in the control of          flexible structures, what the current state of affairs in the                   application of pde techniques to these problems is, where this area of          research is heading, and where should it be going.",
