 "awd_abstract_narration": "Manufacturing features such as chamfer, round, fillet, keyway, and bore         are only implicitly embedded in solid modeling representations.  The            objective of this research is to develop an algorithm capable of                extracting such manufacturing features from a Constructive Solid                Geometry (CSG) tree and further rebuilding the tree to unify feature            representations.  This research consists of two phases:  Phase 1                focuses on the study of individual features mainly to develop                   algorithms that are capable of extracting and unifying a large variety          of features; and Phase 2 involves an effort to coordinate all distinct          features within a CSG tree, and then to support application uses such           as automatic process planning and volume approximation.",
