 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research activities will be in two areas:  study of new laser               sources and electron beam processing of microelectronic materials.              Laser action is investigated in negative glow discharges in which three         body electron recombination is the excitation mechanism of the laser            upper levels.  Electron beam discharges are used to create dense                plasmas having low electron temperatures (KT =0.1-1 eV) in which large          recombination rates can be obtained.  The goal of this project is to            demonstrate both pulsed and true cw recombination laser action in an            electron beam excited plasma and to study the excitation mechanism.  In         the second area of research, dc electron beams will be used to                  demonstrate large area etching and recrystallization of microelectronic         films.  The first experiments will focus on studying electron beam              induced etching of silicon and SiO;i2.  Etch rates, selectivity, and            anistropy of this new etching technique will be investigated.  Finally,         a multikilowatt line source glow discharge electron beam is being               developed to recrystallize polysilicon films over large areas for SOI           applications.  Polysilicon film will be recrystallized and its                  properties evaluated and compared to those films recrystallized with            other techniques.",
