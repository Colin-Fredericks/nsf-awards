 "awd_abstract_narration": "The specific aims of the research are as follows:  to systematically            study the growth kinetics of hybridoma cells in continuous culture and          to examine the applicability of the Monod model to the system under             different growth limiting substrates; to elucidate the functional               relationship among growth, antibody production, and rates of change of          various environmental parameters.  Special attention will be given to           the effect of cellular energy metabolism on these relationships.  The           research also aims to examine the cause of sudden cell death occurring          in batch culture and to explore its relationship to the lower viability         at low dilution rates reported in the literature; and to apply the              kinetic information obtained from the above studies to manipulate cell          growth and production in the culture toward an optimum path.  This              research will advance the understanding of the growth of hybridoma              cells.  The problems addressed by this study are related to process             technology.  The kinetic information obtained from this study will              complement the biological studies in this field.",
