 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will follow a novel approach for assessing remaining life         in an existing simple-span, steel girder highway bridge.  The                   objectives are to develop a method for obtaining a quantitative                 assessment of the deterioration in a steel bridge caused by corrosion,          and to develop testing procedures for estimating the remaining life in          the most highly stressed material in an existing steel bridge without           jeopardizing that life.  The investigation will be based on tests of            bridge beams that have been taken out of service after performing for           more than 50 years.  Both axial fatigue testing of small specimens and          testing of entire beams will be conducted.  To quantify the effect of           corrosion, the fatigue strength reduction factor will be calculated             using a form of Neuber's rule.  The testing procedure for estimating            remaining life will be based on using salvaged beams to establish how           the fraction of life remaining varies between specific locations.               Full-sized salvaged beams will be tested.",
