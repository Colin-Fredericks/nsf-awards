 "awd_abstract_narration": "A model has been developed which describes the transient performance            (which is more realistic than assuming steady state performance) of             large-scale assembly systems.  This model has computer run times which          are low and affordable (CPU cost of $1.00, for example), compared with          prohibitive costs for simulation runs ($700, for example).  The model           is based on two assumptions, which were partially verified in the               preceding work.  One purpose of this research is to complete the                verification.  If this can be done, the result should be a planning             process to guide the system designer in developing and evaluating               alternative designs; a quantitative procedure to assure effective               material management; and a descriptive model that quantifies all                relevant trade-offs in test/rework strategies.  The approach involves           four tasks.  First is development of the mathematics required to                manipulate the model and to reduce errors resulting from                        approximations.  Second is generation of a computer program that can            apply the model for both description and prescription.  Third will be           evaluation of the tools in actual production situations.  Fourth will           be dissemination of the results, including making the computer program          available in usable form.",
