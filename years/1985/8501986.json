 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current research on community recovery from major natural disasters is          hampered by the dearth of economic analyses of localities before and            after such events.  This project will measure the economic conditions           of communities by using movements in the price of housing services over         time.  Approximately 100 communities will be examined, about one-half           of which will have experienced a major natural disaster.  Hedonic               techniques will be used to monitor changes in the price of housing              services which, according to theory, should be a sensitive indicator of         local economic adjustment to a disaster.  The changes over time in the          price of housing services will be related to a variety of factors,              including the local economic conditions unrelated to the disaster, the          factors influencing aid distribution, the amount of economic aid, and           the extent of the disaster.",
