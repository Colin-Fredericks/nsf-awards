 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to design, construct, and evaluate an              interactive VLSI designer's assistant called \"Agent\".  The assistant            captures the design graphically; estimates its speed, space, and power          (S/S/P) complexity; explains its analysis; indicates potential trouble          spots; and suggests changes.  To construct the assistant, several               elements are required:  a design language (Gdl) as a communication              medium between the designer and the assistant, and as the external view         of the internal design representation (database); procedures to                 mechanically estimate the S/S/P complexity of a Gdl description; and an         interactive tool to edit and manage the design, invoke the analytical           procedures, explain results, and make suggestions.  To gain experience          with the design language and Agent, it is intended to design,                   fabricate, and test a Content Addressable Processor.  The Content               Addressable Processor approach is being applied to first order logic,           semantic nets, and production rules, and shows promise as a new kind of         non-numeric computing architecture.",
