The participants for the symposium-             workshop will come from universities, research establishments, and              industrial organizations, both from the United States and from                  overseas.  The symposium- workshop will be organized to include papers          and progress reports on current particulate and multiphase processes            research and development, as well as roundtable discussions and                 workshop discussions; the proceedings and the workshop reports will             bepublished.  Further, the symposium-workshop will provide a                    comprehensivestate-of-the-art assessment of the progress of particulate         and multiphase processes research,   development, and applications in           the chemical industry, in the  utilities industry, and in other                 industries.  As a result of the workshops, a rational basis for                 identification of areas of particulate and multiphase processes for             further research,  development, and applications will be established.",
