 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research develops an innovative method (non-destructive technique)         for estimating residual stresses in a solid body.  The new method               considers residual stress as constitutive information, the values of            which are derived from an appropriate combination of theory and                 experiment and by selecting the upper and lower bounds from measured            parameters.  The research will investigate conditions where the                 displacement or stress field is free from residual stresses and will            examine the elastodynamics of residually stressed bodies.  Determining          the residual stress is the key to assessing the integrity and                   serviceability of mechanical components and structural systems.                 Available destructive and non-destructive methods are not fully                 adequate to measure residual stress distributions in a solid body.  The         research will have a fundamental impact on the prediction of the                integrity and performance of structural and mechanical components which         use materials with varying degrees of ductility.",
