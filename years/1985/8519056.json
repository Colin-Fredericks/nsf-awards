The          focal issues of this conference include the integration of air, water,          and land considerations in the practice of environmental engineering;           the increasing role of computers in education, engineering practice,            and research; and the incorporation of matters relating to design and           operation of environmental engineering facilities and systems into              education and associated research.  The conference has been planned             jointly by the Association of Environmental Engineering Professors and          the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and is the fifth in a           series initiated in 1960.",
