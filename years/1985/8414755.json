 "awd_abstract_narration": "Surveys have determined that the majority of accidents, injuries, and           fatalities on two-lane rural roads are related to improper speed                estimations.  A technique to achieve a correction for this problem is           to improve the consistency in the horizontal alignment which should             result in an improved consistency in the driver speeds and enhance              traffic safety.  This project will investigate a new design procedure           to analyze the consistencies and inconsistencies in road                        characteristics and the corresponding driving behavior.  The project            will determine boundaries for good design practices, boundaries to              correct geometric defects in the horizontal alignments, and will                recommend solutions for the different levels of dissimilarities in              horizontal alignments.  The results will be very useful to                      transportation engineers and officials with respect to the design or            redesign of two-lane rural highways.",
