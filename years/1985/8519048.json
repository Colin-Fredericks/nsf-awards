 "awd_abstract_narration": "As a design progresses, the design space becomes more constrained due           to the decisions that have been made.  For example, once a construction         material has been chosen, all the properties of that material become            constraints that limit and shape future decisions in the design.  A             constraint model of design will be created that will keep a system of           accounts for the designer as a design evolves.  The constraint model            also includes the idea of appropriate level of detail--that is, the             required level of knowledge of properties of a material are different           at different points in the design process.  A computer model that               presents too much information too soon is not useful to the designer.           To develop this model, the researchers will study how designers frame           the design tasks in different computational environments and how                designers work in the different environments of architecture and                engineering.  As part of the research, a survey and critique of current         models and methods for design will be undertaken.  One area of emphasis         will be the differences and similarities in architectural and                   engineering design.",
