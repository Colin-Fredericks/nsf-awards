 "awd_abstract_narration": "For structures having flexible diaphragms, the coupling effects between         torsion and translation becomes important.  A torsional analysis can be         quite cumbersome due to the large number of degrees of freedom                  generally required.  This proposed research is directed toward finding          suitable torsional response analysis techniques for taking advantage of         symmetry in such structures having only small eccentricities.  In this          study, the translational seismic ground motion is treated as an                 effective rotational motion, thus allowing an uncoupled analysis taking         advantage of the quasi-symmetry.  Suitable techniques of correcting             such analysis for translational coupling effects are investigated, so           as to produce results sufficiently in agreement with those from                 conventional analysis.  In addition, the feasibility of obtaining               useful design information from uncoupled models excited into the                nonlinear range is also examined.",
