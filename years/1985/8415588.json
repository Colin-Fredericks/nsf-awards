 "awd_abstract_narration": "A previously developed theory of consolidation with double porosity,            which unifies Biot's and Barenblatt's concepts, will be further                 examined to consider the effects of non-isothermal temperature                  distributions, preferred orientation of fissures, non-Darcean flow, and         inelasticity of the matrix.  Jointed rocks of the Coulomb-friction type         will be considered and their response in the presence of fluid flow             will be investigated.  The rigid block method will be employed to               validate the continuum predictions.  Concepts from percolation theory,          Voronoi tesselations, and averaging procedures will be employed and             recently developed methods modeling the spatial evolution of general            microstructures will be applied to the study of fissured rock problems.         Emphasis will be put on the localization of microstructures, their              relations to localization of damage and deformation, as well as the             effect of fluid flow upon them.  Both the theory and the theoretical            predictions will be validated.",
