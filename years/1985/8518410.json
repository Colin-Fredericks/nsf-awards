 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will be the second workshop involving bridge engineers             from the United States and Japan and is under the auspices of the               U.S.-Japan Agreement of the Panel on Wind and Seismic Effects.                  However, this workshop will discuss topics of general interest in the           subjects of performance of bridges under current conditions,                    strengthening of bridges to meet existing standards, techniques to              repair bridges, and estimation of the remaining life of various types           of bridges.  The preservation of today's bridges is an important factor         in the nation's highway transportation problems.  The proceedings will          include suggestions for future research needs to solve the problems of          repair, retrofit, and rehabilitation of bridges in the United States.           The information derived from this workshop will be very beneficial to           bridge engineers, academic faculty, bridge researchers, and government          agencies.",
