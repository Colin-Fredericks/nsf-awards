 "awd_abstract_narration": "The speech of a number of victims of sudden hearing loss who have               previously had normal speech and hearing will be analyzed.  The local           medical community will identify such persons at an early stage of their         deafness, and any changes which may occur in their speech over the              three-year course of the project will be tracked.  On the basis of              preliminary work, it has been established that there are wide                   variations in the developmental patterns of such subjects' speech after         deafness.  Recordings of their speech made at regular intervals will be         analyzed according to a number of relevant parameters, and the results          will be used to test a number of specific hypotheses about the role of          hearing in speech, hypotheses which can account satisfactorily for the          full range of observable data.  To the extent that time and resources           allow, the speech of normally hearing subjects whose hearing has                temporarily been blocked by one of a variety of techniques will be              examined.",
