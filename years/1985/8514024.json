 "awd_abstract_narration": "Automation of short-run assembly cannot be justified economically.  The         problem is how to reduce the labor cost for runs of medium length.  It          was hoped that this could be accomplished by use of robots which are            reprogrammable.  Two approaches have been taken.  One is to develop             visual, tactile, and force sensors for the next generation of robots so         that they can find the parts to be assembled and then guide them to             their appointed positions in the assembly.  The other approach is to            use the present generation of robots, but to reduce the cost of                 equipment which brings the piece parts to locations where the robot can         find them and pick them up.  Much time and money have been spent on the         first approach but the results have been far from satisfactory.  This           effort deals with the second approach.  Four tasks are undertaken:              design, fabrication, test, and evaluation of low cost, easily                   programmable part feeders that convey parts, one by one, from a jumbled         collection to a point where the robot can find them, properly oriented;         design, fabrication, test, and evaluation of three- and four-finger             grippers versatile enough to handle a large variety of parts;                   establishment of an assembly work station based on the foregoing tasks;         and development of rules for designing parts and products so that they          are suitable for robot-based assembly systems.",
