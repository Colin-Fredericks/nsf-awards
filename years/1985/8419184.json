The study is           conducted by a Committee on Chemical Engineering Frontiers, which will          produce a document outlining research needs and opportunities that will         be useful to program officers and administrators at the National                Science Foundation and other sources of funds for chemical engineering          research.  The Committee is composed of about 25 distinguished chemical         and process engineers from universities and industry.  The Committee is         sub-divided into seven sub-panels as follows:  Energy and Natural               Resources Processing; Biochemical and Biomedical Engineering; Advanced          Materials; Chemical Engineering Aspects of Electronic, Photonic, and            Recording Materials and Devices; Environmental Protection, Safety, and          Hazardous Materials; Computer-Assisted Process and Control Engineering;         and Surface and Interfacial Engineering.",
