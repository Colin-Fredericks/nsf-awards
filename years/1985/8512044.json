 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fifth U.S. National Conference on Wind Engineering will be held on          the campus of Texas Tech University November 6-8, 1985.  The conference         will:  expedite early communication of research activities and research         findings, stimulate exchange of knowledge and research in complementary         research areas, and promote lines of communication between research             workers and practicing architects and engineers for rapid utilization           of research findings in professional practice.  The two and one-half            day conference will consist of sessions on a variety of subjects                concerning wind engineering research and applications.  Some of the             specific subjects are wind tunnel and field testing for wind effects,           characterization of wind, assessment of wind hazard, windstorm damage           mitigation, and application and innovations in wind engineering.  The           presentations will consist of invited papers and papers selected from           abstract submission.  Proceedings will be printed from the papers               received and will be distributed at the conference.  Anticipated                attendance at the conference is 200 persons.",
