 "awd_abstract_narration": "The application of VLSI technology to communication systems has played          a key role in reducing the cost of many types of systems in use today           and will play an increasingly important role in the future.  This               research is directed at exploring new ways to use silicon integrated            circuit technology to improve the performance and reduce the cost of            communication systems of various kinds.  A broad program aimed at more          closely approaching the limits to the frequency and dynamic range in            metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuits is suggested.  In           this endeavor, the following research problems are included:                    high-frequency switched-capacitor filters, high frequency                       continuous-time filtering techniques, generation of arbitrary nonlinear         functions for communications, MOS signal conditioning and sensing               circuits, temperature compensated crystal oscillators and broadband MOS         analog circuit design applications.  The research requires the                  extensive use of the newly renovated and expanded microelectronics              fabrication facilities for the purpose of fabricating experimental              integrated circuits.",
