 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent developments on Stackelberg Games and Incentive Strategies are           adopted to develop a novel decomposition approach for the solution of           dynamic optimization problems.  The approach involves stage-wise                decomposition, and stems from the following observation:  \"In the               dynamic programming approach to optimization, if the cost-to-go                 functions at every stage were known, then the solution of an N-stage            optimal control problem would be obtained by solving (in parallel) N            decoupled static (single stage) optimization problems.\"  Taking this            observation as a starting point, the principal investigators suggest            that even if the optimal cost-to-go functions are not known, one can            start with some initial guesses, solve the corresponding N static               optimization problems, update on the initial guesses using these                solutions, solve a new set of optimization problems,...and so on...,            until some convergence is achieved.  The research is to study various           aspects of this scheme, including its convergence properties,                   computational requirements and feasibility, and apply it to an economic         dispatch problem arising in power systems.",
