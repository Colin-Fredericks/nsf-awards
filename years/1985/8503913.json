 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data processing facilities are highly vulnerable to earthquake damage.          Effective steps can be taken to mitigate earthquake damage, but no              guidelines, standards, or recommended procedures exist which can be             used by those who operate or procure computer services.  The absence of         such information limits assurance that such facilities can and will             remain functional during and after an earthquake.  This project will            develop seismic design guidelines for data processing facilities.  The          guidelines will be suitable for use in several circumstances:  to               assist the owner and designer in selecting the level of performance             that is required; to provide criteria and specifications to govern the          design and procurement of new or strengthened facilities; to provide            guidance to the engineers or systems analysts in selecting approaches           to meet performance requirements; to provide minimum evaluation                 standards; and to guide computer industry manufacturers in the design           of their equipment.  Other equipment and processes of the banking and           insurance industries will also be considered in this research project.",
