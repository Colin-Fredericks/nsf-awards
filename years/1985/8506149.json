 "awd_abstract_narration": "Adaptive control algorithms presently dominating the theoretical                literature have recently been demonstrated to behave poorly when                assumptions used to prove their idealized behavior are violated.                Though such violations undoubtedly occur in practice, adaptive                  controllers have been repeatedly documented as successful in a variety          of applications.  This research will focus on eliminating the                   theory-practice gap due to the impractical, current theoretical                 limitation that the controller structure be sufficient to arbitrarily           modify all modes of the plant behavior.  Thus, the aim of this research         is the development of a theoretical framework for describing, and               subsequently improving, the robustness of restricted complexity                 adaptive controllers.  The major directions to be pursued are the               characterization of undesirable parameter estimate drift in restricted          complexity adaptive control as well as generation and evaluation of             algorithm fixes given improved understanding of stability/instability           mechanisms in existing algorithms.",
