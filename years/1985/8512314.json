 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is concerned with the problem of statistical signal                processing for signal and noise processes modeled as fractional                 Brownian motions.  Fractional Brownian motions provide analytical               models for random processes that exhibit 1/f-type spectral behavior and         thus that have unexpectedly strong long-term serial dependencies.  This         type of behavior is poorly modeled by the rational models that are              commonly used in the analysis of statistical signal processing                  problems.  Since many physical phenomena exhibit this type of behavior          (including, among many other examples, flicker noise in oscillators),           it is of interest to study the properties of these processes in the             context of signal processing functions.  Several specific aspects of            this problem that will be considered for these models include signal            detection, parameter estimation, and signal estimation; stochastic              control; and information theoretic issues.  The principal goal of this          study is to establish the general methodology and performance                   expectations for processing of signal or noise phenomena that can be            modeled in this way.",
