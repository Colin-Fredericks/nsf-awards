 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research program is to understand the limitations and          capabilities of computing hardware.  Discovery of new computing                 architectures and algorithms for those architectures is another aim,            and mathematical proof is the methodology used.  The work focuses on            the issue of programming parallel computers.  This study examines how           parallel supercomputers based on fat-trees, a new class of                      general-purpose routing networks, might reasonably be programmed.  The          long-term goal is to build a \"metacircular evaluator,\" which is like a          Lisp interpreter or a universal Turing machine.  Given a description of         a parallel computing structure and inputs to the structure, the                 evaluator should be able to simulate itself.  The short-term plan               leading toward this long-term goal is to study specific parallel                algorithms, particularly set- and graph-theoretic ones.  A library of           efficient data/processor structures which can be used as building               blocks in more complicated algorithms is being developed.  The research         also investigates how parallel programs might be debugged and more              easily understood.",
