 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this study, research on the dynamic behavior of inflatable dams will         be undertaken.  Such dams are used in the United States, Australia, and         other countries for water impoundment, flood control, diversion of              flow, raising spillway elevations, and other purposes.  They also have          potential application as a transportable flood control device.  Even            though a few of these dams have failed dynamically, published analyses          have only considered static forces and deflections.  The vibrations and         dynamic response of inflatable dams will be studied systematically.             The dams may be inflated by air, water, or a combination of air and             water.  The dam material acts like a membrane and cannot sustain                bending or compression.  The effects of various assumptions related to          the fluid and membrane properties, such as incompressibility and                inextensibility, will be investigated.  Particular attention will be            focused on conditions for local or global instability of the dam.",
