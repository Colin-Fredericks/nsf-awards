 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the advent of recent advances in VLSI prototyping, it is now               practical to think about the implementation of rather complicated,              computationally intensive, adaptive, time-varying, and non-linear               control schemes.  Such schemes are a matter of necessity in the control         of new generation aircraft, submarines, missiles, and robot                     manipulators which have rather severe nonlinearities in their dynamics.         In this research, methodologies for adaptive, linear, and nonlinear             control systems are examined which will generate algorithms that can            later be implemented in custom VLSI format.  One specific application           which will be of focal interest to the work will be the real-time               control of robot manipulators.  The advantages of focusing on the               application to robot manipulators are two:  First, manipulators are             available in this laboratory on which to try out the control laws; and          second, the dynamics of robots are complicated, non-linear, and                 imprecisely known, resulting in the necessity for non-linear, adaptive,         and pre-view control schemes which make this application a good                 benchmark for the algorithms.",
