The project is directed             toward optimal use of base isolation devices to achieve maximum                 protection from earthquake hazards.  The research will use the results          of previous studies to project furtherunderstanding of base isolation           systems.  Consideration will be given to the realistic characterization         of the ground excitation and the supporting soil, the effects of                friction in the base isolation system, the effects of hysteretic                damping, the effects of torsion,  the development of simplified                 procedures directed toward engineering practice, and the effects of             mechanical properties of the system.",
