 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a real-time, Time-Of-Flight Positron Emission Tomography medical             imaging system, the execution time of the reconstruction algorithm is           an important factor in the overall image reconstruction time.  In this          research, the performance of a sine transform reconstruction algorithm,         which was shown to require fewer operations than the existing                   algorithm, will be evaluated in terms of the image resolution and the           signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed image. The objective of this         research is to confirm the assertion that this fast reconstruction              algorithm does not impair the quality of a reconstructed image.                 Mathematical analysis on simple images and computer simulation of               three-dimensional models of both a heart and a portion of a brain will          be done.  The effects of accidental coincidence events, the intrinsic           resolution of detectors, and the physical arrangement of detectors will         also be examined in the simulation.  A fast, real-time system can make          possible the transient study of biochemical and physiological processes         in living organs and may open new frontiers in medical research.",
