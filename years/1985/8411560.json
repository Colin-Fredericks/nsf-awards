 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies of the ionization of vibrationally excited nitrogen open up an          important new area--an approach by the use of a target focused by a             free jet expansion.  Also, the use of laser excitation forproduction of         either state- or temperature-specific vibrational distributions will            provide opportunities for an entirely new class of measurements.  With          the emphasis of work at the interface between solid-state and gas-phase         chemistry and physics, the research is significant for practical                technologicalapplications in discharges of many kinds.  Knowledge of            ionization potential is critical to the understanding of ionization             balance in discharge plasmas; dissociative attachment to form negative          ions may be the key to the control of high power switches; and the              understanding and control of vibrational populations is essential to            the modeling and design of future laser systems.  The diagnostics used          may also prove quite useful in eventual technologies for the tailoring          of chemical reactions by the use of lasers to producestate- specific            molecular populations.",
