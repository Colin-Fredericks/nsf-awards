Industries will be selected to participate on the basis of similar              technical competence (i.e., steel, biotechnology, and membranes).  It           is envisioned that faculty and student exchange programs as well as             joint research will be part of the output from this workshop.  The              workshop will provide valuable information to the NSF                           Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers Program in examining           various levels of international interaction among universities and              companies in preparation for an NSF experiment in determining the               suitability of establishing I/U CRC's having an international                   orientation.",
