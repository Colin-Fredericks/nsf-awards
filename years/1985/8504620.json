 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cryptography has become an important tool in data protection.                   Cryptosystems can be used to solve a large number of the data security          problems.  While cryptosystems have been used successfully in                   protection of messages, the discovery of many different types of                cryptosystems has led to possible solutions for many other problems in          data security that appeared to be either difficult to solve or were not         suitable for \"classical\" types of cryptosystems.  Most of the recent            discoveries of cryptosystems have been in the digital domain.                   Digitizing data, however, is not always possible or economical.  This           research is intended to study new cryptosystems for protecting analog           signals' privacy and authenticity.  Public key analog cryptosystems             will also be studied.  In view of the relative scarcity of fast, secure         digital public key cryptosystems, such cryptosystems might also be of           interest in digital applications.",
