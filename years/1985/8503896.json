 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to develop analytical models to                investigate parts routing in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS).  To         be processed in a FMS, a part normally has a large number of                    alternative routes to follow.  These alternative routes contribute to           the flexibility of the system, and enable it to cope with random                disturbances.  It is therefore desirable that parts routing in a FMS            should follow a dynamic scheme which is adaptive to the on-line state           of the system.  Earlier work on dynamic routing is extended through             studying the concept of routing flexibility.  Specifically, the                 required on-line information for managing routing flexibility will              first be identified and an information-theoretic measure, \"routing              entropy,\" will be developed to quantify routing flexibility.  Based on          this measure, a routing principle, \"least reduction in routing                  entropy,\" will be proposed which aims at maximizing the routing                 flexibility in the on-line system.  A dynamic routing scheme will be            studied which implements this principle and is developed through                modeling the FMS as a closed queueing network.",
