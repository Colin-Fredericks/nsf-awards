 "awd_abstract_narration": "A laboratory devoted to research on artificial intelligence (AI)                applications in the design and development of decision support systems          (DSS) will be established in the Department of Systems Engineering at           the University of Virginia.  This laboratory will be used to improve            the quality and to broaden the scope of a range of ongoing DSS research         activities, as well as to undertake new AI-based research in this area.         Among the research activities which will share the proposed laboratory          facility are projects concerning the development of knowledge-based or          expert DSS for computer simulation optimization.  The objectives of             these projects include the development of a theory of simulation                optimization and the implementation of this theory in at least two              types of expert systems:  those providing guidance in the selection of          alternative optimization approaches and analysis techniques; and those          utilizing different types of domain-specific expert knowledge to                optimize particular simulations.  The principal equipment to be                 acquired is a Symbolics 3670-1211 Computer System, supporting the               Zetalisp development environment, the object-oriented programming               systems FLAVORS, and the Fortran 77 and Pascal programming languages.",
