 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with the creation of devices for use in an                  integrated millimeter-wave receiver in the frequency range 30-100 GHz.          Such a receiver is potentially useful for short-range atmospheric               communications where there are large unassigned frequency bands.                Interest in this area is increasing because advances in gallium                 arsenide microfabrication have made it possible to build millimeter             wave devices in integrated form.  The major problems to address involve         circuit design and circuit measurements.  While the problems of circuit         design are relatively straightforward, the problems of circuit                  measurement are much more difficult.  Although there is instrumentation         available, none has proven to be adequate for research in this                  frequency range, particularly at the higher end.  Instead of coupling           into the waveguide as is usually done, the measurements are performed           in an integrated circuit fashion right on the chip itself or by                 coupling to other planar circuits.",
