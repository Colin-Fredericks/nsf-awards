 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research addresses the integration of CAD and CAM through the              automatic generation of a manufacturing process plan from a 3-D CAD             part description.  The objectives of this project are four-fold.                First, a method will be developed to define form-features important to          manufacturing (such as holes, threads, etc.) that enables automatic             recognition of features from a CAD database.  Second, researchers will          implement previously developed algorithms to separate joined                    form-features in a part cavity and store their descriptions in a data           structure called a feature node.  Third, the detailed structure of a            feature node will be defined according to the necessary information             required to manufacture each feature.  These feature nodes will be              linked into a larger global structure called a feature graph.  The              links represent relationships among the features in the part.  Fourth,          and most important, a method will be developed to automatically                 generate a generative process plan for the part by traversing the               feature graph.  This final step will involve interfacing an expert              system for process planning with a solid modeler to calculate optimal           machining parameters and machine tool sequencing.  Evaluation of the            software will be through extensive testing with industry supplied part          descriptions and comments from industrial users.",
