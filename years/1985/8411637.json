 "awd_abstract_narration": "Compaction-induced stresses, as well as their associated deformations,          can be of major importance in analysis of many types of engineered              earth structures and soil-structure systems.  They can significantly            affect earth pressures, soil-structure interaction, hydraulic                   fracturing and separation, and the strength and behavior of compacted           soil masses.  This research is intended to refine and verify recently           developed incremental finite element analysis procedures and behavioral         models for hysteretic soil loading and unloading, extend these models           and analytical procedures to consider cohesive soils, and develop a             reliable basis for establishing modeling parameters critical to the             analytical procedures developed.  The research will include laboratory          testing, development and refinement of behavioral models and analytical         procedures, and analysis of field studies.  This research will directly         address the issue of the variation of stress and associated time                effects for soil masses derived from engineering processes and will             utilize the most recently developed laboratory techniques for stress            measurements.",
