 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objectives of this study are to describe the scope and character of         engineering research and establish its significance to the nation's             goals, and to determine the role that engineering research is playing           in advancing the nation's productivity and maintaining its                      international competitiveness.  Issues that determine the health of the         engineering disciplines, particularly in academia, are identified.  The         study also identifies and highlights  especially active or emerging             areas of engineering research that need early attention in achieving            national goals and international competitiveness.  The project                  determines if difficulties exist with the methods by which engineering          research is sponsored and  stimulated, and determines incentives and            procedures for  attracting the best young minds to graduate schools of          engineering research.  Policy issues that need to be addressed                  regarding the conduct of the Federal Government's activities in support         of engineering research are identified by examining the engineering             research activities of concerned Federal Government agencies (NSF,              ONR, AFOSR, ARO, DOE, NASA, DARPA, etc.).  Methods that can be used to          alleviate perceived problems are defined.",
