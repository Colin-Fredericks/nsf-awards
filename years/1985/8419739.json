 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves investigations of the seismic response of a model         of the six-story steel structure which was tested by the psuedo-dynamic         method of applying forces to the building at the Building Research              Institute Laboratory at Tsukuba, Japan.  This phase of the program is           obtaining data on the response of the steel model from various                  earthquake accelerograms applied to the Berkeley shaking table.  The            steel model currently being tested on the shaking table is a                    three-tenths scale model of the six-story, concentrically braced                building.  Following the completion of this series of experiments, the          model will be revised to represent the eccentrically braced frame               building which was also tested in Japan.  When all the experimental             data have been obtained, correlation studies will be made with the              full-scale building data to compare results by the two methods of               experimentation, to determine scale factor relationships and to verify          and/or modify analytical procedures and construction practices.",
