 "awd_abstract_narration": "Japan is ahead of the U.S. in introducing significant earthquake hazard         reduction and preparedness innovations, particularly when it comes to           the industrial sector.  Thus, the U.S. could learn a great deal from            Japan in this regard.  This project will assess the applicability of            Japanese industrial earthquake risk reduction practices to the U.S. by          comparing existing practices among Japanese and U.S. firms.  The                emphasis of the study will be on private sector measures.  The process          whereby earthquake risk reduction activities have evolved and their             funding and place within the corporate structure will be studied.  In           addition, existing engineering-oriented solutions will be analyzed.             The interaction between government agencies and the private sector in           promoting risk-reduction practices will also be investigated.  Data             will be collected in both countries through site inspections at                 relevant institutions, interviews with key officials, and the                   acquisition and analysis of documentary information.",
