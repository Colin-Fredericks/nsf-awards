 "awd_abstract_narration": "A program of basic research is undertaken to explore the use of                 different coding options on non-uniform channels found in modern                digital communication systems.  Disturbances such as fading due to              multipath transmission or interference cause errors that are received           in bursts, resulting in non-uniform statistics for the channel.  In             this research the performance of codes, both block and convolutional,           on non-uniform channels will be investigated.  Reasonable channel               models will be developed and the performance of different codes for             these channel models will be evaluated.  Interleaving has long been             used in conjunction with coding as a means of achieving reliable                communication on burst-error channels.  In this research, the                   performance of interleaving vis a vis burst error correcting codes will         be examined.  Other important tasks include the investigation of the            performance of concatenated coding systems as measured by their                 effective channel cutoff rate,    channel capacity, and undetected              error probability.",
