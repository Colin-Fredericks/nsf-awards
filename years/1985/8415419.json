Interpretation and analysis of the Phase I test results are now in              progress in Japan.  Japanese researchers will not be performing                 significant analysis of the test results for Phase II, and the emphasis         of the analysis of the Phase I analysis may not be suitable for U.S.            practitioners, because U.S. and Japanese practices are quite different.         The Phase I and Phase II test results are analyzed from a U.S.                  perspective; these results are correlated to U.S. practice and                  appropriate recommendations are developed for seismic design as well as         future research; and these results are disseminated to the practicing           profession.  An interim report is prepared within 6 months of the start         of this study to quickly disseminate general test results and                   conclusions.  A more detailed final report is prepared at the end of 24         months.",
