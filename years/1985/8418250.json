 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to investigate a new technique for            the production of amorphous alloys.  This method is called Rapid                Pressure Solidification (RPS).  The process involves pressurizing the           material in order to form a solid rather than the usual manner of               cooling.  The process will eliminate the sizing, compaction, and                sintering required in the fabrication of engineering components from            rapid temperature solidified powders.  The research will be carried out         in phases.  In the first phase work will be directed at refining the            existing RPS scheme by including pressure and temperature                       instrumentation, by seeking reproducibility of the current results, and         by conducting a search for a low temperature alloy which will                   consistently show the effects of rapid pressurization.  The second              phase will consist of matching theory with the experimental results.            Metallurgical kinetics, solid-solubility, and the thermodynamics of             binary systems and the effects of high pressure on them will be                 investigated.",
