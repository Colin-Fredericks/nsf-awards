 "awd_abstract_narration": "Refinements are being made to a system which achieves name placement            without ambiguity and without overlap.  The current system is able to           achieve maps of an acceptable quality.  Many cartographic conventions           are successfully incorporated:  avoidance of having a feature and its           name separated by an intervening line feature; splitting a line feature         to permit a point feature name to overlap it; curving all horizontal            point and area feature names to parallel the curving of                         constant-latitude lines; and placing area-feature names to span the             feature.  To achieve area-feature name placement that more consistently         yields good results, a new approach to area-feature name placement is           investigated.  The new approach uses a different scheme for abstracting         area shape than the medial-axis transform (skeleton) scheme used in             earlier work.  In essence, it first approximates a given area boundary          by means of a polygon of relatively few sides, using the Ramer                  algorithm.",
