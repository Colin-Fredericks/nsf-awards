 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers are interested in high speed electro-optics because beyond          the electronic technology is the optical technology.  Efforts include           growth of quaternary compound semiconductors by organo-metallic                 chemical vapor deposition, picosecond infrared spectroscopy, and                integrated optical devices.  The goal is to make current devices work           better and to invent as well as to characterize new devices.  The               following projects have been identified:  measurement of fluctuations           of new injection lasers, simulation of the performance of future high           speed optical communications systems, development of a picosecond dye           laser system working in the same wavelength range as optical                    communications systems, demonstration of ultra high speed modulators            and time-division demultiplexers, development of computer-aided design          tools for optical circuitry, and study on the long-term stability of            the LiNbO;i3 devices.  With progress in all the above-mentioned                 projects, electro-optics can be brought to higher sophistication.",
