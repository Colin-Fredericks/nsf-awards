 "awd_abstract_narration": "Experimental research conducted during the past ten years has tended to         indicate that there is a deviation between experimental behavior and            analytical predictions for double layer grid space trusses.  However,           in recent tests in an improved experiment design on a custom designed           truss in which imperfections were minimized, much better correlation            was obtained.  Most practical space truss systems do have natural and           unavoidable imperfections and, as a consequence, these results cannot           be directly translated to practical space trusses.  A series of tests           will be performed on small experimental space trusses to demonstrate            the fundamental load carrying and failure mechanisms of these                   structures.  The results of the tests will be compared with                     state-of-the-art analytical predictions.  The experiments will                  demonstrate space truss failure mechanisms and fundamental structural           behavior.",
