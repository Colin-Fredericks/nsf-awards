 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fermentation technology can be used to convert hydrocarbons, wastes,            and renewable materials (e.g., crops and trees) into complex organic            materials, such as antibiotics and enzymes, and to single-cell protein,         an alternate food source.  To help make these processes economically            competitive, this study focuses on two problems: as product                     concentration increases in a fermentation reactor, microbial activity           is inhibited and the product can be degraded.  This process attempts to         avoid these problems by continuously removing product from the reaction         mixture.  This is accomplished by adsorbing the product as it is formed         onto a solid polymeric adsorbent which is introduced directly in to the         mixture.  The physio-chemical and biochemical behavior of a model               fermentation process in the presence of such an additional non-aqueous          phase will then be analyzed.",
