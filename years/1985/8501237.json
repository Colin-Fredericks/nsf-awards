 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cost over-runs are commonplace today, e.g. in construction of nuclear           power plants and mass transit systems, and in the generation of large,          complex software programs.  Experiments are being made on a trial and           error basis to ascertain cost-effectiveness of computer-based factory           automation.  These and other examples show that there is still much to          be learned in the field of engineering economy.  Unfortunately, the             research community is small and practitioners in industry often have to         learn by experience.  The purpose of the conference proposed here is to         follow-up a conference held at Mountain Lake, Virginia on August 28-29,         1984.  A list of research topics was identified at that conference, and         placed in priority.  It was found that the present scope of the field           is too narrow for modern industry and that the topics in the fields             should be better organized.  The goal of this conference is to remedy           these deficiencies through the interchange of a working group of                experts from industry and academia.",
