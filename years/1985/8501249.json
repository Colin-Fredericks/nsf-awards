 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite the inherent increase in optical power density available with           guided waves, practical nonlinear guided wave devices have not been             forthcoming due to the lack of appropriate materials.  The researchers          are investigating a candidate material of great promise, semiconductor          doped glass, which has recently been shown to have large nonlinearities         from optically induced plasma creation, and with potentially picosecond         excitation and recovery times.  The rise and fall times of the                  nonlinearity are being investigated experimentally using degenerate             four-wave mixing with a sub-picosecond laser source.  The commercially          available materials being investigated consist of small semiconductor           crystallites in a glass matrix.  Deposition techniques are also being           developed to fabricate semiconductor composite films.  The fabrication          of thin-film composite semiconductor-dielectric materials from a range          of substances should broaden the range of device possibilities                  achievable, and enhance understanding of the mechanism responsible for          the optical behavior of these materials in both the linear and                  nonlinear regimes.  Nonlinear channel devices are going to be                   fabricated by using ion exchange in commercially available glasses by           lithographic techniques to form the required patterns in the deposited          semiconductor films.",
