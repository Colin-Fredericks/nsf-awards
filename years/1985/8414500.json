 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research is to investigate and define                  quantitative mechanisms for several cause and effect relationships in           the spray drying of foods.  The experiments and interpretation are              directed toward identification and quantitative modeling of the                 transport processes underlying the spray drying of liquid foods.  The           phenomena under investigation include: changes in particle morphology           during drying; drying rate, particularly as influenced by changes in            particle morphology and by feed composition; rates of loss of volatile          trace organic substances, as influenced by the temperature/humidity             field and mixing patterns in the vicinity of the atomizer, and by               changes in particle morphology and feed composition; factors governing          the temperature/humidity field and mixing patterns near the atomizer;           and mechanistic factors underlying stickiness and agglomeration                 properties of the product.  This work is a logical progression toward           defining the importance of the variables influencing the properties of          spray dried products:  density, volatile retention and stickiness.",
