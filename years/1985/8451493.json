 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop methods for design and             evaluation of sensory feedback loops for supervisory decision and               control in flexible manufacturing cells.  In these applications,                processes evolving in continuous space and time are modeled and                 controlled as asynchronous discrete events.  The task to be automated           is decomposed into basic discrete operations with alternative                   sequencing and precedence relations among the subtasks.  To analyze             alternative feedback structures, information-theoretic measures are             being explored as a means for representing the requirements of the              operations and the information and decision spaces of the system                components.  Information-based models will characterize sensor                  resolution, actuator accuracy, and the effects of alternative internal          models for information processing and decision algorithms.  Techniques          from optimal stochastic control are being investigated for potential            application to decision problems in flexible cells with real-time               resource allocation.  As a tool for evaluating alternative feedback             structures and decision algorithms, a discrete-event simulation model           of the automated processes will be implemented with explicit                    representation of the sensory feedback loops.",
