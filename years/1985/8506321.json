 "awd_abstract_narration": "Equipment is obtained that is required to perform testing on VLSI chips         and this equipment consists of two parts.  The first part is a logic            analysis system which includes a logic analyzer and a pattern                   generator.  The pattern generator generates a sequence of test vectors          which are then fed into the unit under test.  The outputs of the logic          analyzer are used to detect errors in the chip (only at the logic               level).  The second part of testing is at the physical level which              requires a probing station system.  This system has probes which can            access almost every part of the chip.  Signals are fed in and out of            the chip and a particular part of the chip can be isolated.  The                Hewlett Packard 163OG is the logic analyzer to be used and the 600-MZ           analytical test station from micro-tec West, Inc., forms that major             portion of the probing system.  The VLSI testing station will be used           to check chips for communication and signal processing systems, in              particular, a concatenated coding system.",
