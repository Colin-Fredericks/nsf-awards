 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large numbers of software packages dealing with various aspects of              production planning and control are appearing on the market.  They are          sold under the rubric of computer-integrated manufacturing.  In                 practice, this is an inappropriate term.  Various languages are used;           the packages will not run on all machines, and, worse yet, they are not         integrated.  One part of this problem will be addressed.  The flow of           information will be traced through a manufacturing company, from                business planning through completion of product manufacture.                    Manufacturing Resource Planning modules (MRPII) are available for               processing much of this information. A software house will provide an           MRPII system for the project.  This system will be interfaced with a            computer drafting module obtained from NASA.  CAD data will feed the            Bill of Material module, with provision for a formal Engineering Change         procedure.  The data can then be used for preparation and release of            purchasing or shop orders.  A number of bridges between the CAD and the         MRPII system will be developed.",
