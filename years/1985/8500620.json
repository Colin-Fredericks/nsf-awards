 "awd_abstract_narration": "A program of research at Texas Tech University has produced indepth             understandings of the structural mechanics behavior of monolithic glass         plates, insulating glass (IG) units and laminated glass (LG) units              under the effects of lateral loads.  These commonly used components of          window glass systems are now being used in an innovative new window             glass system called \"structural glazing.\"  In this system, the glass            component (monolithic glass plate, IG unit, LG unit) is connected to            the secondary structural frame of multistory buildings with a liquid            structural sealant (commonly silicone) so that no mechanical device             extends beyond the face of the outer-most glass plate.  This research           will integrate known component behaviors into an evaluation of the              integrated structural mechanics behavior of structurally glazed window          systems.  Theoretical formulations using numerical methods will be              employed.  These formulations will be verified through experiment.              Expected results include an improved understanding of the complex               structure which a designer is asked to place on the side of a                   multistory building.",
