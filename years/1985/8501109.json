The FCC will undertake advisory studies         dealing with such subjects as preliminary planning of federal                   facilities, the development of an integrated computer system for                construction data, the state of the art of \"intelligent\" building               concepts, and construction change orders.  In addition, FCC consulting          committees will assemble information on the experiences, policies, and          practices of federal agencies regarding quality control of federal              construction projects, the use of non-traditional methods of                    procurement, and new methods of maintaining facilities.",
