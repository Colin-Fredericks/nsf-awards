 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research involves novel applications of intersecting waveguides,           and studies of the physical mechanisms which control the                        electro-optical characteristics of a device, limit its performance, and         affect its reproducibility.  Several novel devices for optical signal           processing which take advantage of recently understood coupling                 mechanisms between intersecting waveguides, as well as the simplicity           of their geometry, are proposed.  Investigators are pursuing important          problems in guided wave integrated optical devices which will be                particularly useful in optical communication systems.  Their solution           would contribute significant results to this important field.",
