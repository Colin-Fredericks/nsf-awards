 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research involves fundamental studies of the kinetics of enzymes            which break down cell walls (cell-lytic enzymes).  For many                     microorganisms desirable materials are produced within the cell, and            before the material can be separated and purified the cell wall must be         ruptured to release the desired contents of the cell.  The development          of superior techniques for breaking the cell wall may be particularly           important for the production of food grade protein and intracellular            enzymes; degradation of cell wall polysaccharides; production of cell           hydrolysates; use as anticaries agents; treatment of fungal diseases;           and, lately, in the release and isolation of intracellular products             obtained by recombinant DNA techniques.  The research studies the               kinetic behavior of the enzyme reactions which leads toward the                 engineering principles necessary for the design of an enzymatic                 cell-disruption reactor.",
