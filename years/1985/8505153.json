 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fundamental problem known as clutter exists in nearly all                   ultrasound imaging and detection applications and cannot be eliminated          by conventional noise reduction techniques such as time averaging or            filtering.  However, a non-linear minimization algorithm utilizing a            frequency decorrelation technique, which achieves significant clutter           suppression in one-dimensional ultrasonic applications, was recently            developed.  The objectives of this research effort are to develop a             two-dimensional ultrasonic imaging system utilizing non-linear clutter          rejection concepts; to develop and refine the theory for the                    two-dimensional minimization algorithm and split-spectrum processing;           and to experimentally verify the theory and evaluate the imaging system         in both clinical and materials applications.  Since improved imaging in         clutter has significant ramifications in both materials and medical             imaging, the successful completion of this research can have                    significant impact on the solution of a fundamental problem in                  ultrasonic imaging.",
