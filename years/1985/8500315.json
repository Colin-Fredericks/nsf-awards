 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to study the characterization of              yeast that are metabolizing very rapidly, using a novel continuous              culture technique called                                                        \"controlled-concentration-coupled-continuous-culture\" (abbreviated as           C5) system.  Conventional means for continuous culturing are the                chemostat in which nutrient is fed into a reactor at a constant rate,           and the turbidostat which employs feedback control of the pumping rate          to keep a constant turbidity of the culture in the reactor.  This study         depends upon another technique for continuous culture employing sensors         for proportional control of substrate concentration.  The research              initially concentrates on demonstrating ethanol production by aerobic           continuous culture at very high dilution rates by the C5 system.                Continuous biological production of ethanol should lower its cost.  The         areas of investigation include: means of increasing ethanol                     concentration and productivity in fermentors; improvement of ethanol            tolerance by microorganisms; and developing methods of achieving                high-density cell cultures.",
