Its objective is to identify the         long-range engineering research needs and opportunities in electronic           materials processing.  The workshop will create an awareness in the             academic research community as to where research can be applied in new          and emerging technologies and to assist NSF management in the possible          focus of future planning and assessment efforts in this area of                 fundamental research.  Invited participants will evaluate the present           understanding and capabilities of:  thin-film formation, including              simple evaporation and molecular beam epitoxy; chemical deposition,             including vapor and liquid phases; innovative deposition processes;             plasma processing for both etching and deposition; and integration as           it relates to the interactions among consecutive and non-consecutive            unit operations.  Top experts in electronic chemical and materials              processing will be invited to attend the workshop.",
