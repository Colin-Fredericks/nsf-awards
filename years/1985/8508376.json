 "awd_abstract_narration": "The atmospheric channel for optical communication is hostile due to             high attenuation during bad weather conditions and due to fading over           long atmospheric paths.  One way to improve the reliability and                 usefulness of these types of systems is through the use of coding to            reduce the error of the decoder bits at the receiver.  Based upon the           use of interleaving of simple codes, the problem of long fades which            cause a large number of errors spanning thousands of consecutive                received bits has been investigated.  To determine what improvements in         system performance can be obtained with realistic interleaving, a               series of experiments were carried out.  The results of these                   measurements indicated that substantial interleaving would be needed to         obtain acceptably low error probability performance.  It is the                 objective of this research to employ a concatenated coding scheme to            obtain satisfactory performance with a much smaller amount of                   interleaving.",
