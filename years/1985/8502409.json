 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the identification and characterization of            the micro-sized crystalline products formed when inorganic components           are rapidly precipitated from solution containing a specific additive           component.  These precipitations are derived in most instances by               homogeneous nucleation and under conditions of large supersaturations,          as two solutions are rapidly mixed in a flow-mixing device (Nielson             rapid mixing method).  To broaden application of the technique, a               modification permits use of more soluble systems through secondary              nucleation mechanisms.  The product crystals are characterized to               determine the extent of crystallinity and the uniformity of additive            distribution by electron microscope and X-ray methods.  The underlying          model visualized and employed in devising the experiments is that               continuous crystal growth occurs, i.e., the crystal surface is diffuse.         The motivation for this work is to produce uniform solid mixtures               suitable for several applications, such as raw materials for refractory         materials, catalysts, and semiconductor systems.  The work also                 provides insight into the basic mechanisms involved when rapid crystal          growth from solution occurs.",
