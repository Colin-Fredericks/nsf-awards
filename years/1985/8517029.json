 "awd_abstract_narration": "Masonry construction comprises a large portion of building construction         in the U.S. and the world.  Reinforced masonry construction use is              increasing in moderate to higher seismic zones because of its apparent          features of economy, fire safety, architectural flexibility, and ease           of construction.  The present state of masonry structural analysis and          design and materials and construction technologies does not enable an           accurate prediction of building behavior under lateral loads such as            seismic loads.  The performance of the composite                                grout-reinforcing-masonry system is important to the ability of a               reinforced masonry system to resist seismic loads.  This research               project will investigate the effects of shrinkage and bridging defects          on the bond between the grout and the cavity wall in the composite and          the effects of shrinkage and bridging on the bond between the grout and         the reinforcing.",
