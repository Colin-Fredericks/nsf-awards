 "awd_abstract_narration": "The demand for upgrading and retrofitting structures to meet current            seismic standards is increasing and there is a pressing need for codes          of practice and methodologies to guide engineers in this large task.            Generally, current building codes do not address repair and                     strengthening problems and the success of repair and strengthening              schemes is highly dependent on the experience of the engineer as well           as the overall construction quality process.  This research project             will address specific topics related to the strengthening of reinforced         concrete frame structures.  These topics include shear-transfer                 problems associated with jacketing existing concrete members with new           concrete, increasing the strength and ductility of moment-resisting             frames by providing a system of steel braces to resist earthquake               loads, improving the performance of frames with weak beams and weak             columns by jacketing the members, and providing the lateral resistance          by infilling single bays of frame structures.",
