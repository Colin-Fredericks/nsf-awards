 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lasers exhibit a variety of dynamic outputs such as relaxation                  oscillations, persistent oscillations, mode locking, Q switching, and           chaotic behavior.  This time evolution encompasses synergetic behavior          as well as a deterministic dynamical approach to ergodic motion.  Of            particular importance are the homogeneously broadened systems such as           the optically pumped molecular lasers and the ruby laser.  These laser          systems may be modeled by Lorenz equations in the mean field limit and          therefore offer the possibility of studying the transition to chaos in          optical systems where data acquisition is rapid and non-intrusive.  The         route to chaos in the CH;i3F and CH;i3OH lasers will be studied as well         as the yet unresolved behavior of the ruby spiking instability.  In             addition, the behavior of coupled cavities will be examined with                emphasis on diode laser systems for swept single mode operation.",
