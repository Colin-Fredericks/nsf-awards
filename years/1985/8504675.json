 "awd_abstract_narration": "Queueing theory and simulation have for some time provided the main             analytical tools in the study of discrete-event-dynamic systems (DEDS).         Such systems evolve in accordance with the occurrence of distinct               events which occur at unknown, irregular intervals and which are                associated with a change in the state of the process.  Perturbation             analysis has shown promise for overcoming some of the limitations               associated with both classical queueing theory and simulation                   techniques.  This approach adopts a dynamic system viewpoint of                 queueing networks and essentially linearizes the state equations,               characterizing them by exploiting their discrete-event-driven nature.           The aim of this research is to investigate wider classes of queueing            networks, where infinitesimal parametric perturbations actually create          finite queue length perturbations.  This is the case in networks with           state dependent routing strategies used to provide flexibility and              enhance reliability.  For a parametrized class of such dynamic routing          strategies, perturbation analysis will be used to optimize the                  strategy.  Validation of the results will be accomplished through the           use of appropriate simulation models.  For simple queueing systems              where closed-form results are available, work will be done to develop           analytical evaluation of the statistical properties of perturbation             analytic performance gradient estimates.",
