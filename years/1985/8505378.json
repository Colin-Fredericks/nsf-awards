 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the technical problems of the chemical industry is designing and         scaling reactors under such conditions where reaction rates and yields          can depend upon both the chemistry and the mixing.  The problem is              particularly difficult because mixing is usually turbulent, micromixing         as well as macromixing is important, and turbulent micromixing is               neither well understood nor easy to measure.  Since rational design and         scale-up require knowledge of both the mixing and chemistry, there is a         need for a simple convenient tool for measuring mixing.  The goal of            this research is to develop and validate an indicator probe which is            based on chemical indicators.  The probe is used to characterize mixing         in terms of probability density functions.",
