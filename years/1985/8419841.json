 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is concerned with the development of symbolic             methods to be used in the simulation of large-scale nonlinear circuits.         Over the past two decades, although symbolic network analysis has been          addressed, its use has been limited because the analysis has been               applied to linear, small-size networks.  To utilize the advantages of           symbolic analysis in the environment of large-scale circuit simulation,         some radically new approaches must be taken.  The goal of this research         project is to investigate such new approaches that are useful for the           simulation of large-scale circuits.  With the new approach taken in             this effort and using the known decomposition methods for large-scale           circuits, symbolic techniques can be applied to large-scale circuits to         enhance computational efficiency.",
