 "awd_abstract_narration": "A study conducted by Peter Rossi and his associates at the University           of Massachusetts has resulted in a rich data base on the attitudes and          actions of a sample of key local and state officials with regards to            hazard mitigation and preparedness policies.  This study will subject           that data base to additional analysis.  A technique known as block              clustering analysis will be used to better understand those who                 champion natural hazard mitigation and preparedness policies, those who         are indifferent or neutral, and those who oppose them. The original             data will be coded to meet the requirements of the block clustering             program; the data will be clustered using the program; the results of           the clustering will be analyzed to yield profiles of the various types          of decision makers; and the results will be presented in a research             report.",
