 "awd_abstract_narration": "A motion picture camera and auxiliary image analysis equipment will be          obtained for an ongoing research effort with a greatly advanced                 capability to study experimentally the fundamental problem of dendritic         crystal growth.  The point of departure of this work is that it will            attempt to account for both free and forced convection of energy and            solute in the context of the dendritic growth of ice and succinonitrile         which means that shapes and pattern formation must be considered.  The          cinemicrography system and image analysis equipment provided here, in           conjunction with the present wild macroscope, temperature measurement           and control for the free and forced convection growth cells provides            the capability of making the necessary measurements with the precision          required to enhance significantly our understanding of dendritic growth         and pattern formation which is fundamental in the development of many           new materials.",
