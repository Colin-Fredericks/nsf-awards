 "awd_abstract_narration": "A three-pronged effort will be conducted on coherent optical sources            and devices with potential applications to optical communication                systems.  Specific projects include broadly tunable optical parametric          oscillators, electrically tunable semiconductor lasers, and noise and           stability properties of semiconductor lasers.  For many applications in         optical communications, it is necessary to have a coherent light source         that is continuously tunable over a large spectral range.  Recently,            the first optical parametric oscillator has been operated using a               single crystal of an organic material (urea).  The spectral range of            interest is very broad and includes a number of important wavelengths           for communications.  In addition, in this program truly smooth                  continuous tuning of semiconductor lasers by electrical means is being          sought.  A new project will be initiated to study the noise and                 stability properties of semiconductor lasers which is fundamental to            successful optical communication systems.",
