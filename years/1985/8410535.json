 "awd_abstract_narration": "Acoustoelasticity is a method which had been studied for use in                 thenondestructive evaluation of stresses within a structural component.         This research program seeks to extend the description of                        acoustoelasticity toadequately model the response of materials                  exhibiting realistic textures to an arbitrary degree.  This will begin          with an analytical study to model the elastic and acoustoelastic                properties of a polycrystalline aggregate from the known                        characteristics of the constituent crystals and their orientation               distribution.  Associated with this is the general description of the           acoustoelastic response of an  elastic wave in an orthotropic body              under arbitrary loading.  Both bulk (longitudinal and shear) and                surface waves will be considered.  Also to be studied is the effect of          finite grain size in a polycrystalline aggregate on the homogeneity of          the effective properties of the aggregate, particularly as they relate          to acoustoelasticity.  A complementary experimental investigation will          assess the practical viability of the proposed models.",
