 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electromigration in Al-based thin films has become an important subject         of study because these films are widely used for metal interconnections         in VLSI circuits and are required to carry high current densities for           circuit operation.  Recent experiments show that current (1/f) noise            measurements can be used as a sensitive tool for detecting                      electromigration damage and for predicting the mean time to failure             (MTF) of the films.  To develop this new tool for studying                      electromigration in VLSI circuits, the current noise of various                 Al-based thin films which have been used in VLSI circuits will be               investigated.  This will be done by measuring the temperature and               current dependence of 1/f noise of these films in different ambients,           including hydrogen and inert gas ambients.  Systematic measurements             will be made to relate the 1/f noise, electromigration damage, and the          MTF of the films.  More information about the kinetics of                       electromigration damage can be obtained from these measurements.  This          study will give information for developing a new technique for                  predicting electromigration damage in VLSI circuits.",
