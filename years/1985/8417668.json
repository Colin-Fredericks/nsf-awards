 "awd_abstract_narration": "Digital transmission of images implemented by VLSI is considered a very         important area because of the possible reduction in the transmitted             information rate subject to an acceptable level of error.  Much of the          research to the present time has been devoted to still-picture, or              intraframe coding.  Other work has been directed towards the interframe         coding, or motion coding, task.  In this investigation, both intraframe         (still) image coding and intraframe (motion) image coding, with an              objective of further bit rate reduction below presently known                   techniques, is pursued.  This research involves vector quantization             principles which are to be extended to color imagery and to temporal            coding.  The goal is to make the objective bit rate substantially lower         than present levels. The first topic involves extending recent work in          intraframe coding to color imagery and to lower bit rates.  Coding of           motion imagery by vector quantizing of the frame difference signals is          also proposed, along with a simple classification scheme to process             color imagery at rates of approximately one-third of the rate that now          exists for standard videoconferencing coders.",
