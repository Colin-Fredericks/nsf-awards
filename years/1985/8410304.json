 "awd_abstract_narration": "A near field scanning optical microscope (NSOM) will be designed and            constructed which will have at least 500A spatial resolution (using             visible light) and spectral selectivity.  It will be based on the near          field collimation of radiation and on recent demonstration of                   techniques to transmit visible light through apertures as small as 1/16         the wavelength.  Contrast and resolution tests will be completed on             patterns generated with the electron beam lithographic capabilities at          the National Research and Resource Facility for Submicron Structures at         Cornell.  Various modes of illumination and detection will be                   investigated to maximize the contrast and signal to noise in this new           form of super-resolution light microscopy.  The working scanning                optical microscope that will be constructed will have a spatial                 resolution comparable to that of a scanning electron microscope but             will be inherently non-destructive since it does not use ionizing               radiation and does not require the sample to be placed in a vacuum.  It         will have enormous potential in biology and medicine since it will be           able to view living systems at a resolution between 80A (the limit of           chemical labeling methods) and 2500A (the limit of fluorescence                 microscopy).  Such an instrument will permit non-destructive                    measurements for integrated circuit metrology.",
