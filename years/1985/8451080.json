 "awd_abstract_narration": "The mechanical properties of fiber-reinforced composite materials will          be studied theoretically within the framework of continuum mechanics.           Emphasis will be placed on exploring the microscopic origins of                 macroscopic properties such as stiffness, strength, and toughness.              Microscopic origins include the properties of the constituent fibers            and matrix, their geometry, and the extent to which they are bonded to          one another.  In fact, the degree of bondedness will constitute a major         theme around which much of the proposed work revolves.  Alterations in          the fiber-matrix bond have been thought to affect toughness                     significantly.  In particular, degradation of the bond frequently leads         to increased toughness in brittle matrix-systems.  Response to the              question, What effect does such degradation have on stiffness in, say,          discontinuous fiber systems? and to similar questions requires a means          of incorporating the degree of bond degradation as a parameter into             continuum-analyses of relevant mechanics problems.  Various means will          be explored, and a number of key problems in which the fiber-matrix             interface plays a significant role will be studied.",
