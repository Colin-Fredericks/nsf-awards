 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this investigation, a comprehensive study will be conducted of iron,         nickel, cobalt and certain of their alloys with a range of mixtures of          carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, hydrogen and water vapor.             The metals studied are of real interest as results can be expected to           apply to a variety of practical materials from structural to stainless          steels.  The gases chosen for this investigation are also of real               interest because they include the reactants of so many significant              processes.  The analytical methods to be used will give a comprehensive         view of the detailed mechanisms involved.  The combination of                   instruments to be employed will serve to give confirmations and                 possible new insights for the surface chemistry of these systems.               Experiments will be performed at different temperatures to give a more          complete understanding of the initiation and growth mechanisms of               carbon filament growth.",
