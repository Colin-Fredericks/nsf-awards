 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a study of the properties of the interfaces in fluid mixtures           at equilibrium, using the methods of thermodynamics and statistical             mechanics, with emphasis on those aspects which are important in                chemical engineering processes.  In a first part, analytical and                numerical methods are used to determine the effects of the range of the         intermolecular forces on the properties of surface tension.  Next, a            method of determining the behavior of surface tension in fluid mixtures         is developed as a function of temperature, by extrapolation from the            critical region, in which so much detailed information has recently             become available.  Finally, the structure and cohesion of surfactant            films occuring in such mixtures as oil and water are studied.                   Analytical, numerical and possibly, videomicroscopic techniques are             used to study this last problem.",
