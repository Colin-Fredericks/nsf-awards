 "awd_abstract_narration": "The phenomena of restricted diffusion and partitioning of large                 molecules in assemblages of spheres is studied.  Past investigations            have used porous media which contain only cylindrical pores.  However,          porous media of interest to many engineering applications is better             represented as assemblages of uniform spheres.  Uniform silica spheres          with diameters of 40 to 200 nm have been fabricated.  Further, spheres          have been compacted at four pressures, resulting in pellets with a mean         pore size ranging from 8 to 96 nm.  Due to the sphere uniformity and            the known surface chemistry of silica, these pellets are ideal porous           media models.  Diffusion coefficients for a number of macromolecules in         several solvents are measured in the project using pellets of varying           porosity/sphere size.  Since the observed partitioning effect is due to         both size exclusion and adsorption, adsorption measurements on                  uncompacted spheres are made. This allows the 'backing out' of the              relationship between the molecule/pore size ratio and the partition             coefficient.  This is compared to a partitioning theory that is                 developed and past experimental and theoretical expressions arising             from work with cylindrical pores.",
