 "awd_abstract_narration": "The problem of feedback control in the framework of linear systems has          been extensively investigated over the years.  Although the theories            developed settled a number of important issues, they generally failed           to address the problem of the complexity (i.e., MacMillan degree) of            the resulting controllers.  The aim of this research is to investigate          problems related to low complexity controllers, using the partial               realization approach.  In particular, the work will encompass aspects           of the partial realization problem as applied to the H-infinity                 optimization problem and the problem of pole placement by dynamic               output feedback.  The motivation for the work is that in the first              problem, no provision for controller complexity exists in the current           theories and in the second problem, the existing results are only               partial.  The significance of the proposed research lies in the fact            that the complexity of the controller is an important design parameter          in feedback control.  Consequently, the design methods should give the          engineer the freedom of choosing it so as to meet design                        specifications.",
