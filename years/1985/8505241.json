 "awd_abstract_narration": "Network scheduling techniques--such as the arrow diagramming Critical           Path Method (CPM), Precedence Diagramming CPM, and the Performance              Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)--were developed extensively for          the defense industry for control of their large government contracts.           These methods have gradually been adopted by a segment of the                   construction industry, but they do not fulfill the criteria which a             good scheduling system should meet.  The objectives of this research            include the development of a modeling approach that depicts the hard            logic and alternative logic for project activities and the development          of optimization functions for the scheduling model to minimize project          cost at various levels of probability in achieving the scheduled                completion date.  In addition, a system as envisioned would require a           unique database which currently does not exist.  An objective includes          the development of a specification for this database and methodology            for database support.",
