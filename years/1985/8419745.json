 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research is an engineering approach to the solution of two                 fundamental problems in designing systolic arrays, namely,                      restructuring of algorithms for increased parallelism and efficient             mapping of algorithms into systolic arrays.  The study investigates:            new syntactic and semantic transformations on complex algorithms for            optimizing area, time, input/output, and other parameters in the                systolic architecture; efficient methodology for mapping algorithms             onto two- or three-dimensional systolic arrays with feedbacks,                  replicated data, general timing, and limited or full broadcasting and           other architectural constraints; design of macropipelines of systolic           arrays and the related problems in interconnection, buffering, timing,          and closure property; and design of macropipelines of systolic arrays           for image processing and pattern recognition.  Emphasis is on both              theoretical and practical approaches in this research.  With the theory         developed, an automated design tool is being implemented so that it can         be interfaced with existing VLSI design tools.",
