 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project deals with a communication systems problem which has great         potential interest.  As relatively inexpensive satellite earth stations         become more universally available, it is crucial to efficiently couple          these stations to terrestrial local area networks.  Several satellite           interconnection network architectures have been developed; however, in          none of these architectures is any provision made for dealing with              satellite link congestion.  Link congestion refers to a gateway                 receiving input traffic from the link at a rate exceeding the output to         the local area network.  This research focuses on the congestion                problem and its effect on performance.  Specifically, researchers will          develop queueing network performance models, develop simulation models          of network behavior, investigate and compare the congestion effect of           various network protocols, and evaluate the performance of current              network architectures.",
