 "awd_abstract_narration": "There has been a rapid escalation of targeted cyber-attacks, called Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), on high-profile enterprises. These skilled attacks routinely bypass widely deployed protection mechanisms. Existing second-line cyber defenses (e.g., intrusion detection systems) are helpful, but they often generate a flood of information that overwhelms cyber analysts. Moreover, analysts lack the tools to piece together attack fragments spanning multiple applications and/or hosts. This project will hence focus on developing the principles, techniques, and tools for accurate attack detection and real-time reconstruction of attacker activities across large enterprises.\r\n\r\nMany intellectual challenges arise in APT campaign reconstruction, including: (a) developing a wide range of policy-based, anomaly-based and signature-based attack detectors, (b) connecting the dots in the presence of unreliable detectors, (c) scaling to large enterprise networks, and (d) resisting adversarial manipulation. To overcome these challenges, this project will explore several novel directions, including (i) domain-specific languages for cyber attack detection and forensics, (ii) novel detection techniques that leverage natural language descriptions of recent attacks, (iii) alternative dependence propagation semantics that mitigate dependence explosion, and (iv) mapping attack steps to the high-level objectives (\"kill-chain\") of APT actors.\r\n\r\nCyber technologies are inextricably woven into the fabric of today's society. Repeated cyber attacks undermine the society's trust in this fabric. Even in purely economic terms, worldwide cybercrime led to $600 billion in losses in 2017 (Source: McAfee). This project will help arrest these downward trends. It will also educate graduate, undergraduate and K-12 students through cybersecurity coursework, research, and outreach activities. Enhanced participation of women and minorities will be targeted through alliances with partners, including the National Center for Women & Information Technology, Governor's State University, and Chicago Public Schools. Project-related data, results, publications and tools will be made available through the web sites of the research laboratories collaborating on this project: http://seclab.cs.stonybrook.edu/ and http://sisl.lab.uic.edu/.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

We therefore developed a new audit logging approach that leverages the new eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) framework in the Linux OS.

In contrast, we made a series of advances that brought a great deal of automation to this domain. Our first work, implemented into a system called HOLMES, connected isolated attack activities into larger scenarios, mapping events to the high-level objectives (\"kill-chain\") of APT actors. At a high-level, our techniques leverage the correlation between suspicious information flows that arise during an attacker campaign. HOLMES generates a high-level graph that concisely summarizes the attacker's actions in real-time. An evaluation of our approach against real-world APTs indicated that HOLMES excels at \"connecting the dots\" to provide a concise high-level summary that can provide a robust basis for real-time cyber response.<br /><br />We next turned our attention to the \"needle-in-the-haystack\" problem. In particular, on very long APT campaigns, HOLMES's information flow based approach can generate a large number of false alarms. We therefore developed two novel techniques, flow attenuation and decay, to limit information flow. Our techniques take advantage of common behaviors of benign processes, while providing a conservative treatment of suspicious processes. The resulting system, called Morse, can sift through millions of events in a matter of seconds to construct graphical summaries that are 35x smaller than previous techniques, while reducing false positives by 11x. In the last year of the project, we collaborated with researchers from Northwestern university to fine-tune tag attenuation and decay parameters using AI techniques, specifically, the gradient descent algorithm. The result is a system called Captain that achieves a further 11x reduction in false positives.<br /><br /><strong>Languages for implementing APT analysis:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>We designed a novel domain-specific language called E* that greatly simplifies the development of diverse detection algorithms, while ensuring fast performance. To simplify and customize scenario reconstruction, we developed FQ, a new query language designed for post-attack forensic analysis. These two languages have been instrumental in the success of this project, enabling us to experiment with a variety of algorithms and techniques and select the best performing ones.<br /><br /><strong>Dissemination:&nbsp;</strong>Our research advances were disseminated through 8 refereed publications, six of which appeared in flagship cyber security conferences. Altogether, these papers have been cited more than a 1000 times. In addition, Stony Brook University obtained a patent for the core detection and reconstruction technique developed in our research. (US patent 11,601,442 B2, issued March 3, 2023.) Finally, our technique for high-resolution data collection has been open-sourced (https://github.com/seclab-stonybrook/eaudit).<br /><br /><strong>Training: T</strong>his project trained 15 students (4 PhD, 8 Master's and 3 undergrads) in cyber security research at Stony Brook University. About a third of these students were women, thus helping to broaden participation.
