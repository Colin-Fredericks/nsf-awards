 "awd_abstract_narration": "Far too many children in the U.S. start kindergarten lacking the foundational early numeracy skills needed for academic success. This project contributes to the goal of enhancing the learning and teaching of early mathematics in order to build a STEM-capable workforce and STEM-literate citizenry, which are both crucial to our nation's prosperity and competitiveness. Preparation for the STEM-workforce must start early, as young children's mathematics development undergirds cognitive development, building brain architecture, and supporting problem-solving, puzzling, and persevering, while strongly impacting and predicting future success in school. Preschool children from low socio-economic backgrounds are particularly at risk, as their mathematics knowledge may be up to a full year behind their middle-income peers. Despite agreements about the importance of mathematics-rich interactions for young children's learning and development, most early education teachers and families are not trained in evidence-based methods that can facilitate these experiences, making preschool learning environments (such as school and home) a critical target for intervention. The benefit of this project is that it will develop a robust model for a school-based intervention in early mathematics instruction. The model has the potential to broaden participation by providing instructional materials that support adult-child interaction and engagement in mathematics, explicitly promoting school-home connections in mathematics, and addressing educators' and families' attitudes toward mathematics while promoting children's mathematical knowledge and narrowing opportunity gaps. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this design and development project is to address the critical need for innovative resources that transform the mathematics learning environments of preschool children from under-resourced communities by creating a cross-context school-home intervention. To achieve this goal, qualitative and quantitative research methodologies will be employed, integrating data from multiple sources and stakeholders. Specifically, the project will: (1) engage in a materials design and development process that includes an iterative cycle of design, development, and implementation, collaborating with practitioners and families in real-world settings; (2) collect and analyze data from at least 40 Head Start classrooms, implementing the mathematics materials to ensure that the classroom and family mathematics materials and resources are engaging, usable, and comprehensible to preschoolers, teachers, and families; and (3) conduct an experimental study that will measure the impact of the intervention on preschool children's mathematics learning. The researchers will analyze Collected data using hierarchical linear regression modeling to account for the clustering of children within classrooms. The researchers will also use a series of regression models and multi-level models to determine whether the intervention promotes student outcomes and whether it supports teachers' and families' positive attitudes toward mathematics. \r\n \r\nThe Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.\r\n\r\nThis award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.",

YM has three components: games for preschool classrooms that build critical mathematics skills in developmentally appropriate ways; a family math component that fosters stronger connections between school and home; and a professional learning (PL) program that provides teachers with early math content knowledge, tools for family engagement, and strategies for fostering positive math mindsets among young children and their caregivers.

This led to the development and refinement of over 55 early math games with teacher and family instructional supports in the form of videos and direction sheets, designed to strengthen foundational math concepts through engaging, hands-on learning. The resulting games build young children&rsquo;s skills in counting and cardinality, subitizing, shape composition and decomposition, spatial reasoning, data analysis, sorting and categorizing, and pattern recognition. To support differential learning, the games are adaptable to varying difficulty levels, allowing teachers to provide a &lsquo;just right&rsquo; level of challenge for individual children.&nbsp;During the pandemic shutdown, the YM PL was enhanced to include virtual sessions and adapted games for remote learning, offering more support to families of young children.</p>\r\n<p><strong>In Phase 2</strong>, we examined the impact of YM and conducted an RCT involving 33 classrooms from three Head Start programs across 2 states. The YM intervention integrated math games, preschool picture books, family math minibooks, and family engagement events to enhance both classroom instruction and at home learning while teachers and families gained hands-on experience implementing early math activities. In the 2022-2023 school year, the study sample included 33 classroom teachers, 318 children, and over 200 families who completed pre- and post-intervention assessments. Unfortunately, the study faced challenges due to teacher turnover, and teacher and student absences (which remained substantial post-pandemic).

YM students also began the year with significantly lower spatial reasoning scores than comparison students, but by spring, the gap had closed and the difference was no longer significant. Notably, our analysis showed that students in classrooms where there was turnover of the original teacher were predicted to score 1.636 points LOWER in numeracy and geometry compared to students in a classroom that <em>did not</em> experience teacher turnover.
